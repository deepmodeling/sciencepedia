While *trans* (E) alkenes are typically more stable than *cis* (Z) isomers in open-chain systems, this rule can be dramatically reversed within the confines of a ring. This problem challenges you to evaluate the stabilities of $(E)$- and $(Z)$-cyclodecene, pushing you to consider how geometric constraints and unique forces like transannular strain can override typical steric arguments [@problem_id:2200610].", "problem": "In acyclic alkenes, the E (entgegen) isomer is generally more stable than the Z (zusammen) isomer due to reduced steric strain. However, in cyclic systems, the constraints of the ring can significantly influence the relative stabilities of geometric isomers. Consider the two isomers of cyclodecene, a ten-membered ring containing one double bond: $(E)$-cyclodecene and $(Z)$-cyclodecene. Based on the principles of conformational analysis and ring strain, evaluate the relative thermodynamic stabilities of these two isomers.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the relative stability of $(E)$-cyclodecene and $(Z)$-cyclodecene and provides the correct primary reason?\n\nA. $(E)$-cyclodecene is more stable than $(Z)$-cyclodecene. This is due to the typical steric hindrance between substituents on the same side of the double bond in the Z isomer, which is minimized in the E isomer.\n\nB. $(Z)$-cyclodecene is more stable than $(E)$-cyclodecene. This is because the $p$-orbitals in the Z isomer have better overlap due to the ring's curvature, leading to a stronger pi bond.\n\nC. $(Z)$-cyclodecene is more stable than $(E)$-cyclodecene. This is because the E configuration in a ten-membered ring forces the carbon chain to span across the ring's interior, introducing significant transannular strain.\n\nD. The two isomers have nearly identical stability. The steric strain in the Z isomer and the ring strain in the E isomer are of comparable magnitude and effectively cancel each other out.\n\nE. $(E)$-cyclodecene is more stable than $(Z)$-cyclodecene. A ten-membered ring is sufficiently large and flexible to be considered \"acyclic-like,\" where trans isomers are always favored for steric reasons.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the relative thermodynamic stability of the $(E)$- and $(Z)$-isomers of cyclodecene and to identify the primary reason for this difference.\n\nFirst, let's recall the general rule for alkene stability in acyclic systems. For disubstituted alkenes, the $E$ (trans) isomer is typically more stable than the $Z$ (cis) isomer. This is because the two larger substituent groups are on opposite sides of the double bond in the $E$ isomer, which minimizes destabilizing steric interactions (van der Waals repulsion). In the $Z$ isomer, these groups are on the same side, leading to greater steric strain.\n\nHowever, this rule does not always hold for cyclic alkenes, especially those of medium size (8-12 carbon atoms). The geometric constraint of the ring can introduce other types of strain that may override the simple steric argument.\n\nLet's analyze the case of cyclodecene (a 10-membered ring):\n\n1.  **$(Z)$-cyclodecene**: In the $Z$ isomer, the carbon chain continues from the double bond without crossing over itself. The ten-membered ring is flexible enough to adopt several low-energy conformations (like a chair-chair conformation) where bond angles are close to their ideal tetrahedral ($sp^3$) and trigonal planar ($sp^2$) values. While there is some inherent ring strain and torsional strain, as in any cycloalkane, it is relatively moderate. The conformation avoids significant non-bonded interactions.\n\n2.  **$(E)$-cyclodecene**: To accommodate an $E$ (trans) double bond within a ten-membered ring, the carbon chain must connect the two ends of the double bond by passing through the interior of the ring. This creates a highly strained structure. The primary source of this strain is **transannular strain**. This refers to the steric repulsion between non-bonded atoms that are forced into close proximity across the ring from each other. In $(E)$-cyclodecene, several hydrogen atoms on the carbon chain that spans the ring are forced into the space occupied by hydrogen atoms on the other side of the ring. This repulsion significantly raises the energy of the molecule. The strain is so severe that the heat of hydrogenation of $(E)$-cyclodecene is substantially higher than that of $(Z)$-cyclodecene, indicating that the $(E)$-isomer is much less stable. The difference in stability is approximately 48 kJ/mol, which is a very large value.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A. $(E)$-cyclodecene is more stable...**: This is incorrect. It applies the rule for acyclic systems without considering the overriding effect of transannular strain in the medium-sized ring.\n*   **B. $(Z)$-cyclodecene is more stable... because of $p$-orbital overlap**: This gets the relative stability correct but provides an invalid reason. The stability difference is dominated by steric factors (strain), not electronic factors related to orbital overlap. Pi bond strength is not significantly different between the isomers in this way.\n*   **C. $(Z)$-cyclodecene is more stable... because of transannular strain**: This is the correct statement. It correctly identifies $(Z)$-cyclodecene as the more stable isomer and accurately attributes the instability of the $(E)$-isomer to the severe transannular strain caused by the carbon chain spanning the ring.\n*   **D. The two isomers have nearly identical stability...**: This is incorrect. The energy difference due to transannular strain in the $(E)$-isomer is substantial, making it much less stable than the $(Z)$-isomer.\n*   **E. $(E)$-cyclodecene is more stable... because a ten-membered ring is \"acyclic-like\"**: This is incorrect. A ten-membered ring is classified as a \"medium ring,\" where ring-specific strain effects like transannular strain are often maximized. Only for large rings (typically 12 or more carbons) does the flexibility become great enough to resemble an acyclic chain, at which point the $(E)$-isomer does become more stable.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that $(Z)$-cyclodecene is more stable due to the significant transannular strain present in the $(E)$-isomer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2200610"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative reasoning to quantitative problem-solving marks a deeper level of understanding.
