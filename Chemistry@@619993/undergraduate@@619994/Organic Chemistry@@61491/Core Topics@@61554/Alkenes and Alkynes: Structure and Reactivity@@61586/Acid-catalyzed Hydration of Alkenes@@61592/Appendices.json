Cyclopentene", "solution": "The key mechanistic principle is that acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene proceeds by Markovnikov addition via a carbocation intermediate: protonation of the double bond gives the more stable carbocation, which may undergo 1,2-shifts if a more stable carbocation can form. Nucleophilic attack by water occurs at the carbocation center, followed by deprotonation to yield the alcohol. The major product distribution is governed by carbocation stability and possible rearrangements. We require the reaction to yield 2-pentanol as the sole major constitutional isomer (stereochemical mixtures are allowed as they are not different constitutional isomers).\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A. 1-Pentene ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3$): Protonation at the terminal carbon forms a secondary carbocation at C2. A 1,2-hydride shift from C3 to C2 would give another secondary carbocation and does not increase stability, so rearrangement is disfavored. Water attack at C2 gives 2-pentanol as the only major constitutional isomer (formed as a racemic mixture, but constitution is the same).\n- B. 2-Pentene ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH=CH-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3$): Protonation can occur at either vinylic carbon, each leading to a secondary carbocation (C2 or C3). Subsequent attack gives a mixture of 2-pentanol and 3-pentanol. Therefore, it does not give a sole major constitutional isomer.\n- C. 3-Methyl-1-butene ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH-CH(CH}_3)\\text{-CH}_3$): Protonation to give a secondary carbocation at C2 is followed by a favorable 1,2-hydride shift to C3 to form a tertiary carbocation. Water attack then yields 2-methyl-2-butanol, not 2-pentanol.\n- D. 2-Methyl-2-butene ($(CH_3)_2\\text{C=CH-CH}_3$): Protonation yields a tertiary carbocation and hydration gives 2-methyl-2-butanol, not 2-pentanol.\n- E. Cyclopentene: Hydration yields cyclopentanol, not 2-pentanol. Additionally, cyclopentene does not match the stated molecular formula constraint $C_5H_{10}$ for an acyclic alkene.\n\nTherefore, only 1-pentene yields 2-pentanol as the sole major constitutional isomer product under acid-catalyzed hydration conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2152153"}, {"introduction": "While Markovnikov's rule provides a strong starting point, the story of carbocation intermediates can be more complex. An initially formed carbocation will rearrange if a simple 1,2-shift of a neighboring group can form a more stable carbocation. This practice [@problem_id:2152142] presents a classic scenario where a 1,2-methyl shift, a type of Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, is necessary to correctly predict the major product, highlighting a crucial aspect of reactions involving carbocations.", "problem": "An alkene, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, is treated with a dilute aqueous solution of sulfuric acid ($\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4$). This reaction condition is known to cause the hydration of the alkene, leading to the formation of an alcohol as the major organic product.\n\nWhat is the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the major alcohol product formed in this reaction?\n\nA. 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol\nB. 2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol\nC. 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol\nD. 2,2-dimethyl-1-butanol\nE. 4-methyl-2-pentanol", "solution": "The reaction conditions are dilute aqueous $\\text{H}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}$, which effects acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene via a stepwise electrophilic addition mechanism proceeding through a carbocation intermediate and following Markovnikov regiochemistry. The general principles applied are: (i) protonation of the alkene to generate the more substituted carbocation (Markovnikov rule), (ii) possible 1,2-rearrangements to form a more stable carbocation (Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement), (iii) nucleophilic attack of water on the carbocation, and (iv) deprotonation to give the neutral alcohol.\n\nFor 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, written as $\\text{CH}_2\\text{=CH-C(CH}_3\\text{)}_2\\text{-CH}_3$, protonation of the double bond occurs preferentially at the terminal carbon to place the positive charge at the internal carbon, giving a secondary carbocation at the position adjacent to the quaternary carbon. This secondary carbocation is less stable than a possible tertiary carbocation obtainable by rearrangement. Because the cationic center is adjacent to a quaternary carbon bearing methyl groups, a 1,2-methyl shift from that adjacent carbon to the cationic center occurs, converting the secondary carbocation into a more stable tertiary carbocation (Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement). Water then attacks the tertiary carbocation to give an oxonium ion, and subsequent deprotonation affords the neutral alcohol.\n\nThe site of positive charge after rearrangement is the carbon originally labeled C3 (the quaternary center), so the hydroxyl group ends up at that carbon. The resulting structure can be represented as $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH(CH}_3\\text{)-C(OH)(CH}_3\\text{)-CH}_3$. The longest continuous chain contains four carbons; numbering to give the hydroxyl the lowest possible locant places the OH at carbon 2, with methyl substituents at carbons 2 and 3. The correct IUPAC name is therefore 2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol, which corresponds to option B.\n\nThus, the major product is the rearranged, more stable tertiary alcohol: 2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2152142"}, {"introduction": "Carbocation stability is typically associated with the number of attached alkyl groups, but powerful electronic effects can override this trend.

Water then attacks C1, and after deprotonation, the product is $\\text{HO-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CF}_3$, namely 3,3,3-trifluoropropan-1-ol. Hence, the first reaction yields propan-2-ol, and the second yields 3,3,3-trifluoropropan-1-ol.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2152119"}]}
