This means both hydrogen atoms from the $H_2$ molecule add to the same face of the alkene's double bond.\n2.  **Product Stereochemistry:** The target product is *meso*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. A meso compound is an achiral compound that contains stereocenters. For 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes, the *cis*-isomer is the meso form, as it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. The *trans*-isomer is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, the question is asking which alkene exclusively produces *cis*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene**\nThe double bond is between carbons C1 and C2, which are also the carbons bearing the methyl groups. The starting alkene is achiral because the double-bonded carbons are sp²-hybridized and trigonal planar. There are no stereocenters in the starting material.\nThe *syn*-addition of hydrogen can occur from either of the two faces of the double bond:\n-   **Top-face addition:** If H₂ adds from the top face, both hydrogen atoms will be oriented \"up\" in the product. This forces both methyl groups to be oriented \"down\". The relative orientation of the two methyl groups is *cis*.\n-   **Bottom-face addition:** If H₂ adds from the bottom face, both hydrogen atoms will be oriented \"down\". This forces both methyl groups to be oriented \"up\". The relative orientation of the two methyl groups is also *cis*.\nIn both cases, the product is *cis*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. Since this reaction pathway is the only one possible and it always leads to the *cis* (meso) isomer, 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene is the correct answer.\n\n**B. 1,6-dimethylcyclohexene**\nIn this alkene, the double bond is between C1 and C6. The methyl groups are on C1 and C2. Carbon C2 is a stereocenter. Thus, this alkene is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Let's consider the hydrogenation of one enantiomer, for example, (2R)-1,6-dimethylcyclohexene.\nThe existing stereocenter at C2 makes the two faces of the double bond diastereotopic.\n-   Addition of H₂ to one face will create a new stereocenter at C1, resulting in one diastereomer (e.g., *cis*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, the meso form).\n-   Addition of H₂ to the opposite face will result in the other diastereomer (*trans*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, a chiral molecule).\nWhile one mode of addition might be sterically preferred, it is extremely unlikely to be 100% selective. Therefore, the reaction will produce a mixture of diastereomers (*cis* and *trans* products) and will not exclusively yield the meso compound.\n\n**C. 2,3-dimethylcyclohexene**\nIn this alkene, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The methyl groups are on C1 and C2. Carbon C1 is a stereocenter. The logic is identical to that for option B. Since the starting material is chiral, hydrogenation occurs on diastereotopic faces, leading to a mixture of diastereomeric products (*cis* and *trans*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane). It does not exclusively yield the meso isomer.\n\n**D. 1-methyl-2-methylenecyclohexane**\nThis alkene has an exocyclic double bond at C2 (a $=CH_2$ group) and a methyl group at C1. Carbon C1 is a stereocenter. The situation is again analogous to options B and C. The starting material is chiral. The two faces of the planar double bond (involving C2 and the exocyclic methylene carbon) are diastereotopic relative to the stereocenter at C1.\nHydrogenation adds one H to C2 and one H to the exocyclic carbon, creating a new methyl group at C2. The addition of H to C2 can occur from two different directions, leading to the formation of two different diastereomers: *cis*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (meso) and *trans*-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (chiral). A mixture of products is formed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene (A) is an achiral starting material where the stereochemical outcome is dictated solely by the *syn*-addition mechanism, which unfailingly produces the *cis* (meso) product regardless of the face of attack. The other three options (B, C, D) are chiral alkenes whose hydrogenation leads to a mixture of diastereomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2158468"}, {"introduction": "The principles of stoichiometry form the bedrock of quantitative chemical analysis, allowing us to determine the identity and amount of substances.
