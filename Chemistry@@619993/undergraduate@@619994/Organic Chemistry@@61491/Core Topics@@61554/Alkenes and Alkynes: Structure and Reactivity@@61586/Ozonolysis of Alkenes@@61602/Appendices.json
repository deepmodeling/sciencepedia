When a reaction is performed on a chiral molecule, it is crucial to understand whether the existing stereocenters are affected. This practice will challenge you to predict the product of an ozonolysis reaction on a chiral cycloalkene, focusing on whether the stereochemical integrity of a remote center is preserved, a key concept in asymmetric synthesis [@problem_id:2188119].", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying the reactivity of a specific chiral alkene, (R)-3-methylcyclopentene. The chemist subjects this compound to a two-step reductive ozonolysis reaction. The first step involves treating the alkene with ozone ($O_3$) at low temperature, followed by a workup with dimethyl sulfide ($(CH_3)_2S$).

Hexanedial", "solution": "1) Identify the reaction and its outcome: Reductive ozonolysis of an alkene with $O_{3}$ followed by $(CH_{3})_{2}S$ cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and converts each alkene carbon into a carbonyl carbon. In a cycloalkene, this opens the ring to give an acyclic dialdehyde (if neither alkene carbon bears more than one carbon substituent).\n\n2) Define the substrate’s structure and numbering: In 3-methylcyclopentene, assign the double bond to C1=C2 (by IUPAC convention), and place the methyl substituent at C3. The ring carbons are ordered C1=C2–C3(–CH3)–C4–C5–back to C1. The stereocenter is at C3 due to four different substituents: H, CH3, the C2-side path, and the C4-side path.\n\n3) Apply ozonolysis mapping: Cleavage of C1=C2 breaks the ring at that bond and oxidizes C1 and C2 to aldehydes. The resulting acyclic chain runs between the new terminal aldehydes through the remaining ring carbons. Thus, the linear connectivity becomes:\nCHO (from C1) – C5 – C4 – C3(–CH3) – CHO (from C2).\nThis is a five-carbon backbone bearing aldehyde groups at both ends, i.e., a pentane-1,5-dial skeleton, with a methyl substituent on the internal carbon corresponding to C3.\n\n4) Assign the substituent position by lowest locants: Numbering a dialdehyde assigns aldehyde carbons as C1 and C5. Numbering from the end that gives the substituent the lowest number places the methyl at C2 (rather than C4). Therefore, the base name is 2-methylpentanedial (implied 1,5-dial).\n\n5) Analyze stereochemistry retention: The stereocenter at C3 is not involved in bond formation or cleavage; only the C1–C2 bond is cleaved. Absolute configuration at C3 is preserved unless the relative CIP priorities invert. For CIP comparison at C3:\n- The two carbon-chain substituents are via C2 and C4. Before ozonolysis, the C2-side outranks the C4-side because C2 is attached (via a double bond) to another carbon, giving the set {C, C, C} versus C4’s {C, C, H}. After ozonolysis, the C2-side becomes an aldehyde carbon with attachments {O, O, H}, which still outranks the C4-side {C, C, H}. The methyl group (C attached to H, H, H) remains lower than either chain substituent, and hydrogen remains the lowest.\nBecause the order of priorities relative to each other does not change across the reaction, the absolute configuration at C3 is retained as $R$.\n\n6) Conclude the full IUPAC name: The product is (R)-2-methylpentanedial.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2188119"}, {"introduction": "Ozonolysis is not just a tool for structural identification; it is also a powerful method for quantitative analysis.
