Under catalytic conditions with NMO, the turnover-determining event is the cycloaddition of OsO$_4$ to the alkene. OsO$_4$ acts as an electrophile, and the alkene donates electron density into the osmium-centered acceptor orbitals. Thus, the rate increases with increasing electron density at the alkene, i.e., with higher alkene HOMO energy and larger donor capacity.\n\nFor a bimolecular elementary step between alkene and OsO$_4$, the second-order rate constant $k$ follows the Eyring equation:\n$$\nk=\\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right).\n$$\nElectron-donating substituents on a styrene increase the electron density on the double bond via resonance (+M effect), raising the alkene HOMO energy and strengthening the interaction with the electrophilic OsO$_4$, which decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases $k$.

The substrate 5-hexyn-1-ene contains a terminal alkene at C1–C2 and a terminal alkyne at C5–C6. The desired transformation is a syn addition to the alkene to form a vicinal 1,2-diol, specifically yielding hexane-1,2-diol-5-yne, while leaving the terminal alkyne largely unreacted.\n\nFor syn dihydroxylation of alkenes, two classical reagent systems are OsO4-based and KMnO4-based. The key requirement here is chemoselectivity: the reagent must react rapidly and selectively with the alkene and not significantly transform the terminal alkyne.\n\nAnalysis of each option:\n\nA. OsO4 (catalytic) with NMO in acetone/water performs syn dihydroxylation of alkenes through a concerted [3+2]-type cycloaddition to form a cyclic osmate ester, which upon hydrolysis yields a syn vicinal diol. Alkenes react much faster than alkynes with OsO4 due to better frontier-orbital overlap and reduced steric/electronic mismatch; alkynes are considerably less reactive toward osmium tetroxide. Under catalytic OsO4 with a co-oxidant (NMO) and typical dihydroxylation conditions, the alkene is efficiently converted to the syn diol while terminal alkynes are largely preserved. Thus, this reagent system satisfies both the syn-selectivity and the chemoselectivity criteria.\n\nB. KMnO4 in cold, dilute, basic solution can effect syn dihydroxylation of alkenes, but KMnO4 is significantly more aggressive and less chemoselective. Even under cold, dilute basic conditions, KMnO4 can oxidize alkynes to 1,2-dicarbonyls or, for terminal alkynes, further to carboxylates under some conditions. This risks undesired oxidation of the alkyne and overoxidation of the alkene, making it less selective than OsO4.\n\nC. KMnO4 in hot, concentrated, acidic solution causes oxidative cleavage of both alkenes and alkynes to carbonyl fragments (and further to acids in some cases), which is incompatible with preserving the alkyne and with forming a diol.\n\nD. Peroxyacetic acid (a peracid) epoxidizes alkenes. Subsequent hydrolysis of an epoxide under typical aqueous acidic conditions gives an anti (trans) diol, not the required syn diol. Moreover, the question calls for a direct syn dihydroxylation reagent system; peracid alone yields an epoxide, not a diol, and the stereochemical outcome upon opening is not syn.\n\nE. Aqueous H2SO4 with HgSO4 is a catalyst system for Markovnikov hydration of terminal alkynes (giving a methyl ketone via enol tautomerization). This would selectively transform the alkyne, not the alkene, and does not produce a diol.\n\nTherefore, the most effective and selective reagent system for syn dihydroxylation of the alkene in 5-hexyn-1-ene while leaving the terminal alkyne mostly unreacted is catalytic OsO4 with NMO (Option A).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2206376"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple transformations, this advanced problem delves into the powerful field of asymmetric synthesis, where creating molecules with precise stereochemistry is paramount.

The stereochemical configuration of the four stereocenters (C2, C3, C4, C5) is R, S, R, S. This molecule possesses a C$_{2}$ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoint of the C3-C4 bond and is perpendicular to it. Rotating the molecule by 180 degrees about this axis maps C2 onto C5, C3 onto C4, and vice versa, while preserving the overall stereochemistry. The diol at C2-C3 has an (R, S) configuration, and the diol at C4-C5 has an (R, S) configuration.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the stereochemical outcome of the Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation.**\nThe SAD is a powerful method for the enantioselective *syn*-dihydroxylation of alkenes. The stereochemical outcome depends on two factors: the geometry of the alkene (E or Z) and the chiral ligand used in the reagent (part of AD-mix-$\\alpha$ or AD-mix-$\\beta$). The general rules for 1,2-disubstituted alkenes are as follows:\n\n-   **For (E)-alkenes:**\n    -   AD-mix-$\\alpha$ (using (DHQ)$_{2}$PHAL ligand) typically delivers the hydroxyl groups to the \"bottom\" face, affording an (S, S)-diol.\n    -   AD-mix-$\\beta$ (using (DHQD)$_{2}$PHAL ligand) typically delivers the hydroxyl groups to the \"top\" face, affording an (R, R)-diol.\n\n-   **For (Z)-alkenes:**\n    -   AD-mix-$\\alpha$ (using (DHQ)$_{2}$PHAL ligand) affords an (S, R)-diol.\n    -   AD-mix-$\\beta$ (using (DHQD)$_{2}$PHAL ligand) affords an (R, S)-diol.\n\nThe target molecule is formed by creating two diol units on a C6 backbone. The required stereochemistry for the C2-C3 diol is (2R, 3S), and for the C4-C5 diol is (4R, 5S).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the potential precursors.**\nThe precursor must be a symmetric hexa-2,4-diene to allow for a double dihydroxylation to form the C$_{2}$-symmetric tetrol. We will now evaluate the outcomes for each relevant option.\n\n*   **A. (2E, 4E)-Hexa-2,4-diene:** This diene is C$_{2}$-symmetric and contains two (E)-alkene moieties.\n    -   Using AD-mix-$\\beta$ would result in two (R, R) diol formations. The product would be (2R, 3R, 4R, 5R)-hexane-2,3,4,5-tetrol. This is not the target molecule.\n    -   Using AD-mix-$\\alpha$ would result in two (S, S) diol formations. The product would be (2S, 3S, 4S, 5S)-hexane-2,3,4,5-tetrol. This is also not the target molecule.\n\n*   **B. (2Z, 4Z)-Hexa-2,4-diene:** This diene is C$_{2}$-symmetric and contains two (Z)-alkene moieties.\n    -   Using AD-mix-$\\beta$ would result in two (R, S) diol formations. The dihydroxylation of the C2=C3 double bond gives (2R, 3S) stereochemistry. The dihydroxylation of the C4=C5 double bond gives (4R, 5S) stereochemistry. The overall product is (2R, 3S, 4R, 5S)-hexane-2,3,4,5-tetrol. This matches the target molecule perfectly.\n    -   Using AD-mix-$\\alpha$ would result in two (S, R) diol formations, yielding the enantiomer, (2S, 3R, 4S, 5R)-hexane-2,3,4,5-tetrol.\n\n*   **C. (2E, 4Z)-Hexa-2,4-diene:** This diene is not symmetric. A double SAD would act on two different types of double bonds (one E, one Z). With AD-mix-$\\beta$, this would lead to an (R, R) diol from the E-alkene part and an (R, S) diol from the Z-alkene part. The resulting molecule would not be C$_{2}$-symmetric and would not match the target. This is not an efficient precursor for the desired C$_{2}$-symmetric product.\n\n*   **D. Hexa-2,4-diyne:** This is a plausible precursor to the diene, but it is not the *direct* precursor for the SAD reaction. To be used, it would first need to be partially hydrogenated. For example, hydrogenation with Lindlar's catalyst would convert the diyne to (2Z, 4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene (option B). Therefore, it is an earlier intermediate in the synthesis, not the substrate for the specified dihydroxylation step.\n\n*   **E. (3R, 4R)-Hexane-3,4-diol:** This molecule is already a diol and does not have the double bonds necessary for a dihydroxylation reaction to form the target tetrol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, (2Z, 4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene is the only precursor that, upon treatment with the correct SAD reagent (specifically AD-mix-$\\beta$), will yield the desired (2R, 3S, 4R, 5S)-hexane-2,3,4,5-tetrol.
