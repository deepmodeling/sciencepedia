The student treats 1-methylcyclopentene with an aqueous solution of bromine ($Br_{2}$ in $H_{2}O$). This reaction is known to proceed via a halohydrin formation mechanism, leading to a major product with specific regiochemistry and stereochemistry.\n\nBased on your understanding of this reaction mechanism, identify the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the major racemic product formed.\n\nA. *trans*-2-bromo-1-methylcyclopentan-1-ol\n\nB. *cis*-2-bromo-1-methylcyclopentan-1-ol\n\nC. *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclopentan-1-ol\n\nD. *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclopentan-1-ol\n\nE. 1,2-dibromo-1-methylcyclopentane", "solution": "The reaction described is the halohydrin formation of an alkene. The reactants are 1-methylcyclopentene, an unsymmetrical alkene, and bromine ($Br_{2}$) in water ($H_{2}O$), a nucleophilic solvent. The reaction proceeds through a multi-step electrophilic addition mechanism.\n\nStep 1: Electrophilic attack and formation of the bromonium ion.\nThe $\\pi$ bond of the alkene acts as a nucleophile and attacks a molecule of bromine ($Br_{2}$). This is an electrophilic addition. The bromine molecule becomes polarized as it approaches the electron-rich double bond. The attack expels a bromide ion ($Br^{-}$) and forms a cyclic, three-membered ring intermediate called a bridged bromonium ion. This intermediate forms across the two carbons of the original double bond. The formation of this bridged ion prevents carbocation rearrangements and is key to determining the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nStep 2: Regioselective nucleophilic attack.\nThe reaction medium contains water ($H_{2}O$), which is a nucleophile. In the bromonium ion intermediate, the positive charge is shared between the bromine atom and the two carbon atoms. The carbon atoms bear a partial positive charge. Because 1-methylcyclopentene is unsymmetrical, the two carbons of the original double bond are not equivalent. One carbon is tertiary (bonded to the methyl group and two other carbons in the ring), and the other is secondary (bonded to two other carbons in the ring). The tertiary carbon can better stabilize a positive charge than the secondary carbon. Consequently, the transition state for the nucleophilic attack has more carbocation-like character at the more substituted (tertiary) carbon. According to Markovnikov's rule for halohydrin formation, the nucleophile (water) will preferentially attack the more substituted carbon atom. In this case, water attacks the tertiary carbon (C1 of the original alkene).\n\nStep 3: Stereoselective nucleophilic attack.\nThe nucleophile ($H_{2}O$) must attack the bromonium ion from the side opposite to the bulky bromine bridge. This is known as an anti-addition. The attack opens the three-membered ring. This results in the bromine atom and the incoming nucleophile's group being on opposite faces of the cyclopentane ring, leading to a *trans* configuration. So, the oxygen from the water molecule will be *trans* to the bromine atom.\n\nStep 4: Deprotonation.\nAfter the water molecule attacks the tertiary carbon, it forms an oxonium ion intermediate (a positively charged oxygen atom with three bonds). A base, which can be another water molecule or the bromide ion ($Br^{-}$) formed in the first step, removes a proton from the oxonium ion. This deprotonation yields the final neutral halohydrin product, which is an alcohol.\n\nStep 5: Naming the final product.\nCombining the outcomes of the previous steps:\n- The bromine atom is attached to the less substituted carbon (C2 of the original double bond).\n- The hydroxyl (–OH) group is attached to the more substituted carbon (C1 of the original double bond).\n- The –OH and –Br groups are in a *trans* relationship.\n\nTo name the product using IUPAC rules:\n1.  The parent ring is cyclopentane.\n2.  The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the suffix is \"-ol\".\n3.  Numbering of the ring starts at the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH group) to give it the lowest possible locant. This is C1.\n4.  The methyl group is also on C1.\n5.  The bromine atom is on the adjacent carbon, which becomes C2.\n6.  Assembling the name gives: 2-bromo-1-methylcyclopentan-1-ol.\n7.  The stereochemistry is *trans*, as established in Step 3.\n\nTherefore, the major product is *trans*-2-bromo-1-methylcyclopentan-1-ol. Comparing this to the given options, option A is the correct answer. The reaction produces a racemic mixture of the (1R,2S) and (1S,2R) enantiomers, which is what is meant by \"major racemic product.\"", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2174404"}, {"introduction": "The outcome of an electrophilic addition is not just determined by the alkene and the electrophile; the solvent can play a decisive role.
