When an alkyne undergoes complete catalytic hydrogenation, using hydrogen gas ($H_2$) in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium (Pd), the triple bond is fully saturated and converted into a single bond, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkane.\n\nConsider all possible unique structural isomers of non-cyclic octynes.

In the carbon skeleton graph, this means each endpoint of the chosen bond must have carbon–carbon degree at most $2$. In 3-methylheptane, the carbon degrees (counting only carbon neighbors) are:\n$$\\mathrm{deg}(C_{1})=1,\\ \\mathrm{deg}(C_{2})=2,\\ \\mathrm{deg}(C_{3})=3,\\ \\mathrm{deg}(C_{4})=2,\\ \\mathrm{deg}(C_{5})=2,\\ \\mathrm{deg}(C_{6})=2,\\ \\mathrm{deg}(C_{7})=1,\\ \\mathrm{deg}(C_{8})=1.$$\nHence any bond incident to $C_{3}$ (the unique degree-$3$ carbon) cannot be a triple bond in a valid alkyne.
