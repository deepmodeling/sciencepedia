Five different synthetic protocols are proposed. Evaluate the options below and identify the one that would most effectively and selectively achieve the desired transformation.\n\nA. Reaction of pent-2-yne with two or more equivalents of chlorine gas ($\\text{Cl}_2$) in dichloromethane ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}_2$) as a solvent.\n\nB. Reaction of pent-1-yne with two or more equivalents of chlorine gas ($\\text{Cl}_2$) in dichloromethane ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}_2$) as a solvent.\n\nC.

Reaction of pent-2-yne with one equivalent of chlorine gas ($\\text{Cl}_2$) in dichloromethane ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}_2$) as a solvent.\n\nE. Reaction of pent-2-yne with two or more equivalents of hydrogen chloride ($\\text{HCl}$) gas.", "solution": "Target analysis: 2,2,3,3-tetrachloropentane has four chlorine atoms distributed as two chlorines on C2 and two chlorines on C3, meaning both atoms of an original unsaturation between C2 and C3 must each acquire two chlorine substituents. This substitution pattern is the hallmark outcome of adding two equivalents of a dihalogen across a carbon-carbon triple bond.\n\nKey reaction principle: Electrophilic addition of halogens to multiple bonds proceeds stepwise. For an alkyne, addition of one equivalent of chlorine gas forms a 1,2-dichloroalkene (typically the trans vinyl dihalide), and addition of a second equivalent of chlorine across the resulting double bond yields a saturated tetrahalide in which each of the two original alkyne carbons bears two halogens, i.e., a 1,1,2,2-tetrahaloalkane across those two carbons.\n\nApplication to pent-2-yne: Pent-2-yne has the triple bond between C2 and C3. Subjecting pent-2-yne to two or more equivalents of chlorine gas in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane accomplishes the sequence described above, leading specifically to 2,2,3,3-tetrachloropentane as the exclusive major product because both additions occur across C2 and C3 and dichloromethane does not interfere.\n\nAssessment of options:\nA. Pent-2-yne with two or more equivalents of Cl2 in CH2Cl2 follows the halogenation pathway described, giving the exact target 2,2,3,3-tetrachloropentane with high selectivity.\nB. Pent-1-yne with two or more equivalents of Cl2 would furnish 1,1,2,2-tetrachloropentane, placing the geminal dichlorides on C1 and C2 rather than C2 and C3; this does not match the target regiochemistry.\nC. Radical chlorination of pentane under UV light produces a complex mixture of mono- and poly-chlorinated products at various positions via a radical chain mechanism, not selectively the desired 2,2,3,3-tetrachloropentane.\nD. One equivalent of Cl2 added to pent-2-yne stops at the dichloroalkene stage (a 2,3-dichloropent-2-ene), not the saturated tetrachloroalkane.\nE. Addition of HCl to alkynes gives hydrohalogenation products; with two equivalents, an alkyne yields a geminal dichloride on a single carbon (for an unsymmetrical internal alkyne, a mixture of regioisomers), and in any case incorporates only two chlorine atoms total, not four, so it cannot produce a tetrachloroalkane.\n\nTherefore, only option A efficiently and selectively yields 2,2,3,3-tetrachloropentane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2174210"}, {"introduction": "Organic synthesis often involves molecules with multiple reactive sites, forcing chemists to predict which part of the molecule will react. This problem [@problem_id:2174231] delves into the concept of chemoselectivity, asking you to determine which of two different triple bonds in a diyne is more reactive towards bromine. The answer lies in understanding how the electronic environment, specifically the influence of alkyl substituents, affects the nucleophilicity of an alkyne.", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating the chemoselectivity of electrophilic additions to molecules containing multiple unsaturated sites. The chemist treats one mole of oct-1,6-diyne with one mole of molecular bromine ($Br_2$) in a carbon tetrachloride ($CCl_4$) solvent at a low temperature ($0\\ ^\\circ C$). The reaction is stopped after the consumption of one equivalent of bromine. Two distinct triple bonds are present in the starting material: a terminal alkyne at the C-1 position and an internal alkyne at the C-6 position. Given the electronic properties of alkynes, predict the major product formed under these conditions.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the major product and provides the best justification for its formation?\n\nA. The major product is 1,2-dibromooct-6-yne, because the terminal alkyne at C-1 is less sterically hindered, allowing for faster attack by the bulky bromine molecule.\n\nB. The major product is 6,7-dibromooct-1-yne, because the internal alkyne at C-6 is more substituted with electron-donating alkyl groups, making it more nucleophilic.\n\nC. The major product is 1,2-dibromooct-6-yne, because the acidic proton on the terminal alkyne at C-1 activates the triple bond towards electrophilic attack.\n\nD. The major product is 6,7-dibromooct-1-yne, because the resulting dibromoalkene product is more thermodynamically stable than the alternative.\n\nE. A nearly 1:1 statistical mixture of 1,2-dibromooct-6-yne and 6,7-dibromooct-1-yne is formed, because both alkynes have similar electronic environments.", "solution": "Electrophilic addition of halogens to alkynes proceeds by initial polarization of $Br_2$, followed by nucleophilic attack of the alkyne $\\pi$ bond on $Br^{\\delta+}$ to form a bridged vinyl bromonium ion. This is the rate-determining step and is favored by higher $\\pi$-basicity (nucleophilicity) of the alkyne. Subsequent anti attack by $Br^{-}$ opens the bromonium to give a trans-1,2-dihaloalkene.\n\nBetween a terminal alkyne and an internal alkyne, the internal alkyne is more electron-rich and more nucleophilic because its $\\pi$ system is flanked by alkyl substituents that donate electron density by inductive and hyperconjugative effects. In contrast, the terminal alkyne has an $sp$-hybridized carbon bearing hydrogen, which is more electronegative and withdraws electron density inductively; the presence of an acidic C–H does not activate the alkyne toward electrophiles. Therefore, the internal alkyne reacts faster with $Br_2$ in $CCl_4$ at low temperature, so with one equivalent of $Br_2$ consumed, bromination occurs selectively at C-6/C-7 to give 6,7-dibromooct-1-yne.\n\nEvaluating the statements:\n- A is incorrect because steric hindrance is not the dominant factor; electronic activation of the internal alkyne controls the rate.\n- B is correct: the internal alkyne is more substituted and thus more nucleophilic, leading to faster formation of the bromonium intermediate and the product 6,7-dibromooct-1-yne.\n- C is incorrect: the acidity of the terminal alkyne does not enhance electrophilic addition; it relates to base-induced deprotonation.\n- D gives an inferior justification: while internal alkenes are often more substituted and can be more stable, the selectivity here arises from kinetic electronic effects in the rate-determining step, not thermodynamic control.\n- E is incorrect: the two alkynes do not have similar electronic environments; internal is more electron-rich and more reactive.\n\nThus, the major product is 6,7-dibromooct-1-yne for electronic (nucleophilicity) reasons, matching option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2174231"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply connecting atoms, modern organic synthesis is about controlling their precise three-dimensional arrangement. This final challenge [@problem_id:2174226] requires you to design a multi-step synthesis where the stereochemical outcome is key.

The sequence is constrained: 1) Halogenation with Br₂, then 2) A second reaction to form the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the appropriate starting alkyne.**\nThe target molecule is racemic-2,3-dibromobutane. The carbon backbone is a four-carbon chain (butane), and the functional groups (bromine atoms) are located at positions C2 and C3. To produce this substitution pattern, the starting alkyne must have its triple bond between C2 and C3. A terminal alkyne like but-1-yne (triple bond between C1 and C2) would lead to functionalization at C1 and C2. Therefore, the correct starting alkyne is the internal alkyne, but-2-yne. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stereochemistry of the first reaction (Halogenation).**\nThe first step is the reaction of but-2-yne with one equivalent of bromine (Br₂). The electrophilic addition of a halogen like Br₂ to an alkyne is a stereospecific *anti*-addition. The mechanism proceeds through a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate, which is then attacked by a bromide ion (Br⁻) from the side opposite to the bridge.\n\nStarting with the linear but-2-yne molecule, the two bromine atoms add to opposite faces of the forming double bond.

This is a hydrogenation reaction, where two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond. We must determine the stereochemical requirement for this addition to yield a racemic product from a *trans* (*E*) alkene.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of additions to alkenes follows a well-defined pattern for C2-symmetric substrates:\n- *trans*-alkene + *syn*-addition → racemic mixture\n- *trans*-alkene + *anti*-addition → *meso*-compound\n- *cis*-alkene + *syn*-addition → *meso*-compound\n- *cis*-alkene + *anti*-addition → racemic mixture\n\nSince our intermediate is a *trans*-alkene ((E)-2,3-dibromobut-2-ene) and our desired product is the racemic mixture, we require a *syn*-addition of hydrogen.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct reagent for the second step.**\nWe need to choose a reagent that performs *syn*-hydrogenation.\n- Na in liquid NH₃ (Option B) is a dissolving metal reduction used to reduce alkynes to *trans*-alkenes. It is not used for hydrogenating alkenes in this context.\n- HBr with peroxides (ROOR) (Option E) causes the radical *anti*-Markovnikov addition of H and Br, not H and H. It is not a hydrogenation reaction.\n- H₂ with Lindlar's catalyst (Option A) is used for the *syn*-hydrogenation of alkynes to *cis*-alkenes. The catalyst is \"poisoned\" and not effective for reducing the more stable alkene double bond.\n- Catalytic hydrogenation using H₂ gas with a metal catalyst such as Palladium on carbon (Pd/C), Platinum (PtO₂), or Nickel (Ni) is the standard method for *syn*-addition of hydrogen to an alkene. The alkene adsorbs onto the flat surface of the catalyst, and both hydrogen atoms are delivered from the catalyst surface to the same face of the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct reagent for the second step is H₂ with a catalyst like Pd/C.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe correct synthesis is:\n1.  but-2-yne + Br₂ → (E)-2,3-dibromobut-2-ene (*anti*-addition)\n2.  (E)-2,3-dibromobut-2-ene + H₂/Pd/C → racemic-2,3-dibromobutane (*syn*-addition)\n\nThis corresponds to Option D, which specifies the starting material as but-2-yne and the reagent for the second step as H₂, Pd/C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2174226"}]}
