{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental skill in organic synthesis is the ability to select the correct starting materials to achieve a target molecule. This problem asks you to work backward, applying your knowledge of electrophilic addition to determine which alkene and hydrogen halide will yield a specific product. Success hinges on a firm grasp of Markovnikov's rule, which dictates the regioselectivity of the addition by favoring the formation of the most stable carbocation intermediate [@problem_id:2168821].", "problem": "An organic chemist is planning a one-step synthesis of 2-iodopropane as the major product. The synthesis will involve the electrophilic addition of a hydrogen halide to an alkene. Below is a list of possible pairs of starting materials. Which pair of reactants will successfully yield 2-iodopropane as the major constitutional isomer?\n\nA. Propene and Hydrogen Iodide\n\nB. 1-Butene and Hydrogen Iodide\n\nC. Propene and Hydrogen Chloride\n\nD. 2-Methylpropene and Hydrogen Iodide\n\nE. Cyclopropane and Hydrogen Iodide", "solution": "The reaction class is electrophilic addition of a hydrogen halide HX to an alkene under polar (ionic) conditions. The regiochemical outcome follows Markovnikov’s rule: protonation occurs to form the more stable carbocation intermediate, and the halide anion then attacks that carbocation. For hydrogen iodide specifically, in the absence of radical initiators, the ionic Markovnikov pathway dominates. Therefore, to obtain 2-iodopropane (isopropyl iodide) as the major constitutional isomer, the starting alkene must be such that Markovnikov protonation produces a secondary carbocation at the middle carbon of a three-carbon chain, which is then trapped by iodide.\n\nPropene (CH3–CH=CH2) satisfies this requirement. Protonation at the terminal carbon yields a secondary carbocation at the central carbon, and subsequent capture by iodide affords 2-iodopropane as the major product. In contrast:\n- 1-Butene with HI gives 2-iodobutane as the Markovnikov product, not 2-iodopropane.\n- Propene with HCl gives 2-chloropropane, not the iodide.\n- 2-Methylpropene with HI gives tert-butyl iodide (2-iodo-2-methylpropane), not 2-iodopropane.\n- Cyclopropane with HI undergoes ring opening to give a linear iodide (predominantly 1-iodopropane), not 2-iodopropane.\n\nThus, the only pair that yields 2-iodopropane as the major product in one step via electrophilic addition is propene and hydrogen iodide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2168821"}, {"introduction": "While Markovnikov's rule provides a reliable starting point, the world of carbocations is dynamic and their intermediates are not static. This practice problem explores the phenomenon of carbocation rearrangements, a key process where a less stable, initially formed carbocation can transform into a more stable one via a hydride or alkyl shift. Mastering this concept is essential for predicting the outcomes of reactions that don't follow the simplest addition pathway [@problem_id:2168799].", "problem": "The reaction of an alkene with a hydrogen halide is a classic example of electrophilic addition. When 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene is treated with an excess of deuterium chloride (DCl), a rearranged product is formed. Given that the reaction proceeds to form the most stable possible product through a mechanism involving carbocation intermediates, identify the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the major organic product formed.\n\nChoose from the following options:\n\nA. 2-chloro-1-deuterio-3,3-dimethylbutane\n\nB. 1-chloro-2-deuterio-3,3-dimethylbutane\n\nC. 2-chloro-3-deuterio-2,3-dimethylbutane\n\nD. 3-chloro-1-deuterio-2,2-dimethylbutane", "solution": "The reaction involves the electrophilic addition of DCl to 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene. The mechanism proceeds via the most stable carbocation intermediate.\n\nStep 1 (Carbocation Formation): The electrophile, $D^+$, adds to the carbon-carbon double bond. According to Markovnikov's rule, the deuteron adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond to generate the more stable carbocation. In 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, $(CH_3)_2C=CH(CH_3)$, the double bond is between a quaternary carbon (C2) and a tertiary carbon (C3). The deuteron adds to C3.\n\nStep 2 (Intermediate): This addition forms a stable tertiary carbocation at C2: $(CH_3)_2C^+-CH(D)CH_3$. Since this is a tertiary carbocation, it is the most stable possible intermediate for this system and is unlikely to rearrange.\n\nStep 3 (Nucleophilic Capture): The nucleophile, chloride ($Cl^-$), attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbocation at C2.\n\nStep 4 (Product Identification): The final product's structure is $(CH_3)_2C(Cl)-CH(D)CH_3$. To name this compound according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain, which is a four-carbon chain (butane). We number the chain to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the end closer to the chlorine gives: 2-chloro-3-deuterio-2,3-dimethylbutane.\n\nThus, among the given options, the correct IUPAC name for the major product is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2168799"}, {"introduction": "The environment in which a reaction occurs can be just as important as the reactants themselves. This exercise investigates a scenario where the solvent also acts as a nucleophile, creating a competition for the carbocation intermediate formed after the initial electrophilic attack. By analyzing this situation [@problem_id:2168759], you will learn to evaluate how factors like concentration and relative nucleophilicity determine the major product in a mixed-nucleophile system.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is investigating the electrophilic addition to alkenes under competing nucleophile conditions. The student dissolves 1-methylcyclohexene in a large excess of methanol, which also serves as the solvent. Subsequently, dry hydrogen bromide (HBr) gas is bubbled through the solution at a controlled, low temperature. Given that the solvent can act as a nucleophile, predict the major organic product of this reaction from the options provided below.\n\nA. 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane\n\nB. 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n\nC. 1-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexane\n\nD. 1-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexane\n\nE. 2-bromo-1-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexane", "solution": "The reaction proceeds by electrophilic addition of HBr to the alkene with possible nucleophilic capture either by bromide or by the solvent methanol.\n\nStep 1 (Carbocation formation): Protonation of the double bond of 1-methylcyclohexene by HBr occurs in a Markovnikov fashion to place the positive charge at the more substituted carbon. Protonation at C2 generates a tertiary carbocation at C1 (bearing the methyl substituent), which is favored over the secondary carbocation at C2. No rearrangement is necessary because the tertiary carbocation forms directly and is already the most stable.\n\nStep 2 (Competing nucleophile capture): The tertiary carbocation can be trapped by either bromide or methanol. The rates of these capture steps can be represented as\n$$v_{\\text{Br}}=k_{\\text{Br}}[\\text{Br}^-][\\text{carbocation}],\\quad v_{\\text{MeOH}}=k_{\\text{MeOH}}[\\text{MeOH}][\\text{carbocation}].$$\nBecause methanol is the solvent, $[\\text{MeOH}]$ is very large compared to $[\\text{Br}^-]$. Even if $k_{\\text{Br}}>k_{\\text{MeOH}}$, the product of rate constant and concentration is dominated by the solvent: $v_{\\text{MeOH}}\\gg v_{\\text{Br}}$. Thus, the carbocation is captured predominantly by methanol to give a methoxonium intermediate at C1.\n\nStep 3 (Deprotonation): The resulting methoxonium ion is deprotonated by a base present in the medium (methanol or bromide), yielding the neutral ether. This corresponds to Markovnikov addition of methanol across the double bond, placing the methoxy group at C1.\n\nNo anti-Markovnikov addition is expected because radical initiators (peroxides) are absent. No vicinal bromo-ether product forms because HBr does not generate a halonium ion under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 1-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexane, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2168759"}]}
