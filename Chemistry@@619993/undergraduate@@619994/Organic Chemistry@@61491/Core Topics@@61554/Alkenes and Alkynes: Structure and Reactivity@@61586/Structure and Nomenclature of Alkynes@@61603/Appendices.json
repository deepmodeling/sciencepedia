However, this name is incorrect according to the rules set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Based on the structure that \"4-propyl-1-hexyne\" describes, what is the correct IUPAC name for the compound?\n\nA. 4-propyl-1-hexyne\n\nB. 4-ethyl-1-heptyne\n\nC. 4-ethyl-6-heptyne\n\nD. 3-propyl-1-hexyne\n\nE. 3-butyl-1-pentyne", "solution": "The task is to determine the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the molecular structure that is incorrectly named \"4-propyl-1-hexyne\".\n\nStep 1: Translate the incorrect name into a chemical structure.\nThe name \"4-propyl-1-hexyne\" suggests a parent chain of six carbons (\"hex-\") with a triple bond starting at carbon 1 (\"-1-yne\"), and a propyl group attached to carbon 4.\n\nThe parent chain is a hexyne:\n`C-C-C-C-C-C`\n\nThe triple bond is at position 1:\n`HC≡C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3`\n\nA propyl group (`-CH2CH2CH3`) is at position 4. So we replace one hydrogen atom on carbon 4 with this group:\n`HC≡C-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3`\n\nThis is the structure we must now correctly name.\n\nStep 2: Identify the correct parent chain.\nThe IUPAC rules state that for an alkyne, the parent chain is the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms that contains the triple bond. We must examine all possible continuous chains that include carbons 1 and 2 (the alkyne).\n\nChain A: The horizontal chain, as implied by the incorrect \"hexyne\" name.\n`HC(1)≡C(2)-CH2(3)-CH(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`\nThe length of this chain is 6 carbons.\n\nChain B: The chain that follows the \"propyl\" substituent.\n`HC(1)≡C(2)-CH2(3)-CH(4)-[CH2(5')-CH2(6')-CH3(7')]`\nTracing this path `C1-C2-C3-C4-C5'-C6'-C7'` gives a continuous chain of 7 carbons.\n\nSince Chain B (7 carbons) is longer than Chain A (6 carbons), Chain B is the correct parent chain. The parent alkane name is heptane, so the parent alkyne name is **heptyne**.\n\nStep 3: Number the parent chain.\nThe parent chain must be numbered to give the principal functional group (the triple bond) the lowest possible locant.\n\nNumbering from left to right:\n`HC(1)≡C(2)-CH2(3)-CH(4)-CH2(5)-...`\nThe triple bond starts at C1. The parent chain is a **hept-1-yne**.\n\nNumbering from right to left (along the 7-carbon chain):\n`...-CH2(5)-C≡C(6)`\nThe triple bond would start at C6.\nSince 1 is lower than 6, we must number the chain from left to right.\n\nStep 4: Identify and name the substituents.\nWith the parent chain identified and numbered as a hept-1-yne, we now identify any groups attached to it that are not part of the chain.\n\nThe 7-carbon parent chain is: `HC(1)≡C(2)-CH2(3)-CH(4)-C(5' from propyl)-C(6' from propyl)-C(7' from propyl)`\nThe group attached to carbon 4 (C4) that is *not* part of this parent chain is the `-CH2-CH3` fragment from the original horizontal chain. This two-carbon substituent is an **ethyl** group.\n\nStep 5: Assemble the full IUPAC name.\nCombine the locant, substituent, and parent chain name in the format: (substituent locant)-(substituent name)(parent name).\n\nThe substituent is an ethyl group at position 4.\nThe parent chain is a hept-1-yne.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is **4-ethyl-1-heptyne**.\n\nStep 6: Compare with the given options.\nA. 4-propyl-1-hexyne: This is the original incorrect name.\nB. 4-ethyl-1-heptyne: This matches our derived correct name.\nC. 4-ethyl-6-heptyne: This name results from incorrectly numbering the correct parent chain from the wrong end.\nD. 3-propyl-1-hexyne: This name has the wrong locant for the substituent.\nE. 3-butyl-1-pentyne: This name results from incorrectly identifying a shorter parent chain.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2204210"}, {"introduction": "A key test of your fluency in IUPAC nomenclature is the ability to translate a compound's name back into its molecular structure and formula.

The more stable the resulting anion (carbanion in this case), the more acidic the original proton. We must therefore analyze the stability of the carbanion formed by deprotonating each of the specified positions in 4-phenylbut-1-yne.\n\nThe structure is `Ph-CH₂(C4)-CH₂(C3)-C(C2)≡C(C1)-H`.\n\nLet's evaluate the stability of the conjugate base for each option:\n\n1.  **Deprotonation at C1 (Option A):** Removing the hydrogen from carbon-1 yields the conjugate base `Ph-CH₂-CH₂-C≡C:⁻`. In this anion, the negative charge and the lone pair of electrons reside on a carbon atom (C1) that is part of a triple bond. This carbon atom is **sp-hybridized**. An sp orbital has 50% s-character.\n\n2.  **Deprotonation at C3 (Option B):** Removing a hydrogen from carbon-3 yields the conjugate base `Ph-CH₂-CH⁻-C≡CH`. The negative charge is on a carbon atom (C3) that is part of a methylene group in an alkyl chain. This carbon atom is **sp³-hybridized**. An sp³ orbital has 25% s-character.\n\n3.  **Deprotonation at C4 (Option C):** Removing a hydrogen from carbon-4 yields the conjugate base `Ph-CH⁻-CH₂-C≡CH`. The negative charge is on a carbon atom (C4) that is **sp³-hybridized**. However, this carbanion is adjacent to the phenyl ring, making it a benzylic carbanion. The negative charge can be delocalized into the pi system of the aromatic ring through resonance, which provides significant stabilization.\n\n4.  **Deprotonation at the Phenyl Ring (Option D):** Removing a hydrogen from the phenyl ring yields a conjugate base where the negative charge is on a carbon atom within the aromatic ring. This carbon atom is **sp²-hybridized**. An sp² orbital has 33.3% s-character.\n\nNow, we compare the stabilities of these carbanions. The stability of a carbanion is highly dependent on the hybridization of the carbon atom bearing the negative charge. The s-character of the hybrid orbital containing the lone pair is the dominant factor. S-orbitals are spherical and are, on average, closer to the positively charged nucleus than p-orbitals. Therefore, a lone pair of electrons in an orbital with higher s-character is held more tightly and is more stable.\n\nThe order of stability based on hybridization is: $sp > sp² > sp³$.\n*   The carbanion at C1 has the lone pair in an sp orbital (50% s-character), which is the most stabilizing situation. This makes terminal alkynes unusually acidic for hydrocarbons ($pKa \\approx 25$).\n*   The carbanion on the phenyl ring has the lone pair in an sp² orbital (33.3% s-character). This is less stable than the sp case ($pKa$ of benzene $\\approx 43$).\n*   The carbanions at C3 and C4 are on sp³-hybridized carbons (25% s-character). While the benzylic carbanion at C4 is stabilized by resonance ($pKa$ of toluene $\\approx 43$), this stabilization is not as effective as the stabilization provided by the high s-character of an sp orbital. The alkyl carbanion at C3 lacks any significant stabilizing features and is the least stable ($pKa$ of ethane $\\approx 50$).\n\nComparing all possibilities, the acetylide anion formed by deprotonating C1 is by far the most stable conjugate base. Therefore, the hydrogen atom attached to carbon-1 is the most acidic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2204238"}]}
