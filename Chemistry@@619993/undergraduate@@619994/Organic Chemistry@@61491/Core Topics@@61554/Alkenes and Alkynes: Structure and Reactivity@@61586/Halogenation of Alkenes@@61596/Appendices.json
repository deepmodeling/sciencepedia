When $Br_{2}$ is added in a nucleophilic solvent such as ethanol, the reaction proceeds via the halonium ion mechanism:\n1) The alkene reacts with $Br_{2}$ to form a cyclic bromonium ion across the double bond. This step is an electrophilic addition.\n2) The solvent ethanol acts as the nucleophile and opens the bromonium ion by attacking the more substituted carbon (Markovnikov orientation), because in the bridged intermediate the more substituted carbon bears greater partial positive character.\n3) Deprotonation of the oxonium intermediate by a base (ethanol or bromide) furnishes the anti addition product bearing a bromine atom on the less substituted carbon and an ethoxy group on the more substituted carbon.\n\nApplying this to 2-methyl-2-butene, the more substituted alkene carbon is C2 (tertiary), and the less substituted is C3 (secondary). Therefore, ethanol adds at C2 and bromine at C3, giving the skeleton CH3-C(EtO)(CH3)-CH(Br)-CH3.\n\nFor IUPAC naming:\n- The parent chain is butane.\n- Substituents are ethoxy and methyl at C2, and bromo at C3 if we number from the end that gives the lowest set of locants.\n- Compare numbering sets: left-to-right gives locants {2-ethoxy, 2-methyl, 3-bromo} which is the set {2,2,3}; right-to-left gives {3-ethoxy, 3-methyl, 2-bromo} which is {2,3,3}.

(2R, 4R)-1,2-dibromo-4-methylhexane", "solution": "The substrate is $(S)$-4-methyl-1-hexene, which bears a stereocenter at C4. Bromination with $\\text{Br}_{2}$ in $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{Cl}_{2}$ proceeds by electrophilic anti addition via a bromonium ion. In a terminal alkene $\\text{CH}_{2}=\\text{CH}-\\cdots$, only C2 becomes stereogenic after halogenation, because C1 becomes $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{Br}$ (not stereogenic). Thus the product has stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\nStep 1: Mechanistic stereochemical constraint.\n- The reaction is anti addition via a bromonium ion; the first $\\text{Br}^{+}$ adds to one face of the double bond to form the bromonium, and $\\text{Br}^{-}$ opens from the opposite face. This fixes that the stereochemistry at C2 is determined by which face of the alkene is initially attacked.\n\nStep 2: CIP priorities at C2 in the product.\n- After addition, substituents at C2 are $\\text{Br}$, $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{Br}$ (the C1 substituent), the C3 side chain, and H. CIP ranking at C2 is:\n$$\\text{Br} \\;(1)\\;>\\;\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{Br} \\;(2)\\;>\\;\\text{C3-chain} \\;(3)\\;>\\;\\text{H} \\;(4).$$\n\nStep 3: Conformational analysis and facial selectivity.\n- Adopt the lowest-energy all-anti zigzag conformation of the backbone C2–C3–C4–C5. At C4, CIP priorities are $1=\\text{C5 side}$, $2=\\text{C3 side}$, $3=\\text{CH}_{3}$, $4=\\text{H}$. Placing the main chain C3–C4–C5 in the plane and choosing the methyl at C4 to project toward the viewer (wedge) while H projects away (dash) gives the sequence $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ as counterclockwise with $4$ away, which is $S$, matching the given $(S)$ configuration. In this preferred zigzag conformation, the $\\text{CH}_{3}$ at C4 projects above the molecular plane that contains the alkene.\n- Therefore, the top face of the C1=C2 double bond (same side as the methyl at C4) is more hindered. The electrophile $\\text{Br}^{+}$ preferentially approaches the opposite (bottom) face of the double bond to minimize steric interaction with the C4 methyl group.\n\nStep 4: Face designation and absolute configuration at C2.\n- For the trigonal C2 center prior to addition, among its three substituents $\\text{C3}$, $\\text{C1}$, and H, the CIP order is $\\text{C3} > \\text{C1} > \\text{H}$. When viewed from one face, if the sequence $\\text{C3} \\to \\text{C1} \\to \\text{H}$ is counterclockwise, that face is $\\text{Si}$; if clockwise, it is $\\text{Re}$.\n- In the standard orientation of the planar chain used above, the top face corresponds to $\\text{Si}$ and the bottom face to $\\text{Re}$. Since the methyl at C4 blocks the top face, attack occurs from the bottom, i.e., the $\\text{Re}$ face.\n- General prochirality rule: addition of a highest-priority group to the $\\text{Re}$ face gives $R$ at the new tetrahedral center; addition to the $\\text{Si}$ face gives $S$. Here, the incoming $\\text{Br}$ at C2 is highest priority, so bottom-face ($\\text{Re}$) attack gives $2R$.\n\nStep 5: Eliminate impossible options.\n- The configuration at C4 remains $S$; no epimerization occurs. Therefore any option containing $4R$ (C, D, E) is invalid. Between the remaining options, the major product is $(2R,4S)$ as derived.\n\nTherefore, the major diastereomer is $(2R,4S)$-1,2-dibromo-4-methylhexane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2173942"}]}
