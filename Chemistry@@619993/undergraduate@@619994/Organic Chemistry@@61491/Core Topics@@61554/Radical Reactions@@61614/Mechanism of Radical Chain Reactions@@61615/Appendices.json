Adamantane has a rigid cage-like structure containing 4 tertiary (bridgehead) C-H bonds and 12 secondary (methylene) C-H bonds.\n\nAt a temperature of 400 K, the reaction yields the two products in a molar ratio of `[2-bromoadamantane] / [1-bromoadamantane] = 111`. The selectivity of radical bromination is determined by the relative rates of hydrogen abstraction by a bromine radical, which is the rate-determining step.
