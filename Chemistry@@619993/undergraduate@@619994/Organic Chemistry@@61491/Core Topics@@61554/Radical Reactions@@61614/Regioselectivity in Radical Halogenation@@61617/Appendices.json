Under a hypothetical set of conditions, the chlorine radical is assumed to be completely non-selective, meaning that the rate of abstraction of any hydrogen atom is identical, regardless of its position on the molecule (i.e., primary, secondary, or tertiary C-H bonds are all equally reactive). This reaction yields a mixture of monochlorinated constitutional isomers, which can be classified as either primary alkyl chlorides or secondary alkyl chlorides. Determine the expected statistical ratio of the total yield of all primary alkyl chloride isomers to the total yield of the secondary alkyl chloride isomer.\n\nExpress your answer as a simplified integer ratio of (Total yield of primary alkyl chlorides) to (Yield of secondary alkyl chloride).
