In an experiment, 2-methylpropene is treated with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in carbon tetrachloride ($\\text{CCl}_4$) with a small amount of peroxide as a radical initiator.

This set of reagents is characteristic of an allylic bromination, which is a free-radical substitution reaction.\n\nStep 1: Identify the starting material and the allylic positions.\nThe starting material is 2-methylpropene, which has the chemical structure:\n$$\n\\text{H}_2\\text{C=C(CH}_3)_2\n$$\nThe carbon atoms of a double bond are called vinylic carbons. The carbon atoms adjacent to the vinylic carbons are called allylic carbons. In 2-methylpropene, the double bond is between C1 and C2 (in the propene chain). The two methyl groups are attached to C2. Therefore, the carbons of these two methyl groups are the allylic carbons. The six hydrogen atoms on these two equivalent methyl groups are the allylic hydrogens.\n\nStep 2: Form the allylic radical intermediate.\nThe reaction is initiated by the formation of bromine radicals ($Br\\cdot$). A bromine radical then abstracts one of the six equivalent allylic hydrogens from 2-methylpropene to form a resonance-stabilized allylic radical and hydrogen bromide (HBr).\n$$\n\\text{H}_2\\text{C=C(CH}_3)_2 + Br\\cdot \\longrightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{C=C(CH}_3)\\dot{\\text{C}}\\text{H}_2 + \\text{HBr}\n$$\nThe radical formed is the 2-methylallyl radical.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the resonance of the allylic radical.\nThe 2-methylallyl radical is stabilized by resonance, which delocalizes the unpaired electron over the allylic system. Let's number the carbons of the main chain C1-C2-C3, where the radical is on C3 and the double bond is C1=C2.\n$$\n\\text{H}_2\\overset{1}{\\text{C}}=\\overset{2}{\\text{C}}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\overset{3}{\\dot{\\text{C}}}\\text{H}_2 \\leftrightarrow \\overset{1}{\\dot{\\text{C}}}\\text{H}_2-\\overset{2}{\\text{C}}(\\text{CH}_3)=\\overset{3}{\\text{C}}\\text{H}_2\n$$\nWe have two resonance contributors for the radical intermediate. The true structure of the radical is a hybrid of these two forms. The reaction can potentially occur at either of the carbons bearing the partial radical character, which are C1 and C3.\n\nStep 4: Determine the product(s).\nThe allylic radical reacts with molecular bromine ($\\text{Br}_2$), which is present in low concentration (generated from HBr + NBS), to form the final product and a new bromine radical, propagating the chain.\nLet's examine the products formed from reaction at each of the radical positions:\n- Reaction at C3: The radical $\\text{H}_2\\text{C=C(CH}_3)\\dot{\\text{C}}\\text{H}_2$ reacts with $\\text{Br}_2$ to give $\\text{H}_2\\text{C=C(CH}_3)\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br}$.\n- Reaction at C1: The radical $\\dot{\\text{C}}\\text{H}_2-\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_3)=\\text{CH}_2$ reacts with $\\text{Br}_2$ to give $\\text{BrCH}_2-\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_3)=\\text{CH}_2$.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the 2-methylallyl radical, the two potential products are identical. Rotating the second product, $\\text{BrCH}_2-\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_3)=\\text{CH}_2$, by 180 degrees about the C2-CH₃ bond axis shows it is the same molecule as the first product, $\\text{H}_2\\text{C=C(CH}_3)\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br}$.\nThus, only a single constitutional isomer is formed.\n\nStep 5: Determine the IUPAC name of the product.\nThe structure of the product is $\\text{H}_2\\text{C=C(CH}_3)\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br}$.\nTo name it according to IUPAC rules:\n1. Find the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional group (the double bond). The chain is three carbons long (propene).\n2. Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. The double bond starts at C1: $\\overset{1}{\\text{C}}\\text{H}_2=\\overset{2}{\\text{C}}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\overset{3}{\\text{C}}\\text{H}_2\\text{Br}$.\n3. Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group at C2 and a bromo group at C3.\n4. Assemble the name, listing substituents alphabetically. The name is 3-bromo-2-methylprop-1-ene.\n\nStep 6: Verify the product properties and evaluate the options.\nThe product, 3-bromo-2-methylprop-1-ene, is achiral as it contains no stereocenters. This matches the problem description.\nComparing the name to the given options:\nA. 1-bromo-2-methylpropene: Incorrect numbering/structure (vinylic bromide).\nB. 2-bromo-2-methylpropane: Incorrect. This would be the product of Markovnikov addition of HBr across the double bond.\nC. 1-bromo-2-methylpropane: Incorrect. This would be the product of radical addition of HBr (anti-Markovnikov).\nD. 3-bromo-2-methylprop-1-ene: Correct.\nE. 1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane: Incorrect. This would be the product of electrophilic addition of $\\text{Br}_2$ across the double bond, a reaction that is disfavored in the presence of NBS.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name for the single, achiral product is 3-bromo-2-methylprop-1-ene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2154353"}, {"introduction": "Moving from predicting products to planning a synthesis, this exercise challenges you to think in reverse.

The reactive step is abstraction of an allylic hydrogen to form an allylic radical, followed by bromine atom transfer at the radical center. Product distributions are governed by the availability and stability of allylic radicals; secondary allylic positions are favored over primary.\n\nThe target product, 4-bromo-2-pentene, has a double bond between C2 and C3 and bromine at C4. This is characteristic of allylic bromination of 2-pentene at the C4 allylic position:\n- Starting from 2-pentene ($\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH=CH}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_3$), abstraction of an allylic hydrogen at C4 gives the allylic radical $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH=CH}-\\dot{\\text{C}}\\text{H}-\\text{CH}_3$, which upon trapping by bromine gives $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH=CH}-\\text{CH(Br)}-\\text{CH}_3$, i.e., 4-bromo-2-pentene. This pathway is favored relative to abstraction at C1 because C4 provides secondary allylic C-H bonds, whereas C1 provides primary allylic C-H bonds.\n\nExcluding other options:\n- 1-pentene can only furnish allylic bromides at C3 or C1 (e.g., 3-bromo-1-pentene, 1-bromo-2-pentene) and cannot place bromine at C4 with the double bond at C2.\n- 2-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene are branched and would yield branched allylic bromides; radical allylic bromination does not rearrange the carbon skeleton to give the straight-chain 4-bromo-2-pentene.\n\nTherefore, 2-pentene is the starting alkene that gives 4-bromo-2-pentene as the major product under NBS, light conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2154354"}, {"introduction": "This final problem delves into the finer details of reaction control by incorporating isotopic labeling. You will examine a case where two different products are possible and must use a thermodynamic principle related to zero-point energy to predict the major outcome.

This reaction proceeds through a resonance-stabilized allylic radical intermediate. When the starting alkene is isotopically labeled, a mixture of constitutional isomers may form, and their relative amounts can be influenced by their thermodynamic stabilities.\n\nA principle based on vibrational zero-point energies governs the stability of deuterated alkenes: there is a thermodynamic preference for deuterium (D) to be located on $sp^2$-hybridized carbons rather than $sp^3$-hybridized carbons.

A zero-point energy principle dictates that deuterium is thermodynamically favored on $sp^2$ carbons over $sp^3$ carbons; thus, the isomer with more D on $sp^2$ carbons is more stable.\n\nStep 1: Identify the allylic site for hydrogen (deuterium) abstraction.\nThe starting alkene is $\\text{CD}_3\\text{CH=CH}_2$, where the only allylic position is the $\\text{CD}_3$ carbon (the terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ is vinylic, not allylic).

This matches options A and C. Options B and D place Br vinylic (not from allylic bromination) and also retain three deuteriums, inconsistent with the required initial abstraction of D. Option E shows only one deuterium and is inconsistent with conservation under a single bromination event from this substrate.\n\nStep 4: Apply the thermodynamic preference for D on $sp^2$ carbons.\nDefine $n_{\\text{D, }sp^2}$ as the number of deuteriums located on $sp^2$ carbons in the alkene portion of the product.\n- For A ($\\text{BrCD}_2\\text{CH=CH}_2$): all D are on the $sp^3$ carbon; $n_{\\text{D, }sp^2}=0$.\n- For C ($\\text{CD}_2=\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{Br}$): two D are on the $sp^2$ carbon of the terminal methylene ($CD_2=$); $n_{\\text{D, }sp^2}=2$.\n\nSince higher $n_{\\text{D, }sp^2}$ corresponds to greater thermodynamic stability, option C is the thermodynamically favored major product under equilibrating conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2154329"}]}
