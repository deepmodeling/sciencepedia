Triplet of triplets", "solution": "The problem asks for the splitting pattern of the signal for the central methylene ($CH_2$) protons in 1,3-dichloropropane ($ClCH_2\\underline{CH_2}CH_2Cl$).\n\nThe splitting of a proton signal is determined by the number of chemically equivalent protons on adjacent atoms, according to the $n+1$ rule, where $n$ is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n\nFirst, we identify the protons of interest, which are the two protons on the central carbon (C2).\n\n$$Cl-\\underset{(C1)}{CH_2}-\\underset{(C2)}{\\underline{CH_2}}-\\underset{(C3)}{CH_2}-Cl$$\n\nNext, we identify the adjacent carbons and the protons attached to them. The central $CH_2$ group at C2 is adjacent to the $CH_2$ group at C1 and the $CH_2$ group at C3.\n\nThe protons on C1 and C3 are the \"neighbors\" that will cause the splitting of the C2 proton signal. There are two protons on C1 and two protons on C3.\n\nThe crucial step is to determine if these neighboring protons are chemically equivalent to each other. The molecule 1,3-dichloropropane is symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry and a $C_2$ rotational axis passing through the central C2 carbon. This symmetry makes the two terminal $CH_2Cl$ groups (at C1 and C3) chemically equivalent. Consequently, the two protons on C1 are equivalent to the two protons on C3.\n\nTherefore, the central $CH_2$ group has a total of $n = 2 + 2 = 4$ chemically equivalent neighboring protons.\n\nNow we apply the $n+1$ rule to determine the multiplicity of the signal for the C2 protons:\nMultiplicity = $n + 1$\nMultiplicity = $4 + 1 = 5$\n\nA signal that is split into 5 peaks is called a quintet.\n\nLet's analyze the incorrect options:\nA. A singlet would result if there were no neighboring protons ($n=0$). This is incorrect as there are four neighboring protons.\nB. A triplet would result if there were two neighboring protons ($n=2$). This would be the case if the C2 protons only coupled to one of the adjacent $CH_2$ groups, which is incorrect.\nD. A triplet of triplets would result if the two adjacent $CH_2$ groups were chemically non-equivalent. In that case, the C2 protons would be split into a triplet by the two protons of the first group ($n=2, 2+1=3$), and each peak of that triplet would be further split into another triplet by the two protons of the second group ($n=2, 2+1=3$). However, due to the molecule's symmetry, the neighbors are equivalent, so simple first-order coupling rules apply.\n\nThus, the correct splitting pattern is a quintet.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2200387"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise explores an important boundary condition that refines our understanding of spin-spin splitting.

Therefore, all twelve protons belong to a single equivalence class and give rise to a single resonance.\n\nAnalyze spin-spin splitting using the first-order rule. The multiplicity for a set of equivalent protons is given by\n$$\nm = n + 1,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of equivalent vicinal (or otherwise appreciably coupled) nonequivalent protons on adjacent atoms. For any methyl group here, the directly adjacent carbon is the sp2 alkene carbon, which bears zero protons. Hence,\n$$\nn = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad m = 0 + 1 = 1,\n$$\nso the signal is a singlet. Intramethyl protons do not split each other because they are chemically and magnetically equivalent. Potential long-range couplings to other methyl groups (four-bond or longer) are both symmetry-suppressed due to magnetic equivalence and generally too small to be observed in a first-order ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum consists of a single signal integrating to twelve protons, appearing as a singlet.\n\nThus, the correct description is one signal, a singlet.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2200375"}]}
