Let the three measured areas be $A_{1}=17.5$, $A_{2}=26.25$, and $A_{3}=52.5$ (arbitrary units). Their ratio is obtained by dividing by a common factor that yields integers.\n\nObserve that $8.75$ divides each:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{1}}{8.75}=\\frac{17.5}{8.75}=2,\\quad \\frac{A_{2}}{8.75}=\\frac{26.25}{8.75}=3,\\quad \\frac{A_{3}}{8.75}=\\frac{52.5}{8.75}=6.\n$$\nTherefore, the hydrogen counts for the three signals are in the ratio $2:3:6$.
