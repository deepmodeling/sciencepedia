There is a symmetry plane through the central carbon, so the two terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ groups are chemically equivalent to each other. Within each $\\text{CH}_2$, the two protons are enantiotopic in an achiral medium and thus chemically equivalent, so each $\\text{CH}_2$ gives a single signal. Therefore, there are two distinct proton environments: the two equivalent terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ groups (total of 4 H) and the central $\\text{CH}_2$ group (2 H). The relative integration is thus $4:2$, which simplifies to $2:1$.\n\nFor splitting, apply the first-order $n+1$ rule: if a set of protons couples to $n$ equivalent neighboring protons, the multiplicity is $n+1$.\n\n- Terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ protons: each terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ is vicinally coupled to the central $\\text{CH}_2$ that has $n=2$ equivalent protons, so the multiplicity is $n+1=3$ (a triplet). Because the two terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ groups are equivalent and not appreciably coupled to each other over five bonds, they appear as a single triplet integrating to 4 H, i.e., relative integration $2$.\n\n- Central $\\text{CH}_2$ protons: the central $\\text{CH}_2$ is vicinally coupled to two equivalent terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ groups, giving a total of $n=4$ equivalent neighboring protons (2 on the left and 2 on the right). Symmetry ensures equal coupling constants to both sides, so the multiplicity is $n+1=5$ (a quintet). This signal integrates to 2 H, i.e., relative integration $1$.\n\nGeminal coupling within each $\\text{CH}_2$ does not lead to additional splitting because the two protons are chemically and magnetically equivalent; longer-range couplings are negligible under the stated first-order conditions.\n\nHence, the expected ¹H NMR spectrum consists of two signals: a triplet with relative integration $2$ (terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ protons) and a quintet with relative integration $1$ (central $\\text{CH}_2$ protons).

We determine the structure as follows.\n\nFirst, compute the degree of unsaturation (index of hydrogen deficiency) from the molecular formula:\n$$\n\\text{DU}=\\frac{2C+2-H}{2}=\\frac{2\\times 4+2-8}{2}=\\frac{10-8}{2}=1.\n$$\nThus the compound contains one ring or one double bond.

Therefore, the unsaturation is consistent with one carbonyl group in an ester.\n\nNext, interpret the ¹H NMR data. The integrals sum to $3+2+3=8$ protons, matching $\\text{H}_8$ in the formula. The patterns and shifts are diagnostic:\n- Signal A: singlet at $\\delta=3.67$ ppm (3H). A 3H singlet near $\\delta \\approx 3.6-3.8$ ppm is characteristic of a methoxy group $-OCH_{3}$ in an ester; it is a singlet because the adjacent atom is oxygen, which bears no hydrogens to couple.\n- Signal B: quartet at $\\delta=2.33$ ppm (2H). A 2H quartet indicates a methylene $-CH_{2}-$ coupled to three equivalent protons (an adjacent methyl group), by the $n+1$ rule. The chemical shift near $\\delta \\approx 2.3$ ppm indicates the $CH_{2}$ is alpha to a carbonyl, i.e., $-CO-CH_{2}-CH_{3}$.\n- Signal C: triplet at $\\delta=1.15$ ppm (3H). A 3H triplet indicates a terminal methyl group coupled to an adjacent methylene (two protons), i.e., $-CH_{2}-CH_{3}$.\n\nCombining these features gives an ester with a methoxy group and an acyl ethyl fragment: $CH_{3}-CH_{2}-COO-CH_{3}$, which is methyl propanoate.

The observed nuclei are the two equivalent protons on the $CH_{2}$ group directly bonded to the same carbon as one deuterium. In first-order ¹H NMR, an observed proton resonance is split by directly coupled nonequivalent neighboring nuclei. The two $CH_{2}$ protons are equivalent to each other, so they do not split each other. The only directly coupled nucleus is the deuterium attached to the same carbon.\n\nSecond, apply the first-order multiplicity rule for coupling to a single nucleus of spin quantum number $I$. The number of lines is\n$$\n2I+1.\n$$\nHere, for deuterium, $I=1$, so the multiplicity is\n$$\n2(1)+1=3,\n$$\ni.e., a triplet.\n\nThird, determine the relative intensities of these lines. For coupling to a single nucleus with spin $I$, the $2I+1$ lines correspond to the $m_{I}$ states $m_{I}=-I,-I+1,\\dots,+I$. In first-order coupling, each $m_{I}$ state contributes equally to the splitting of the observed proton resonance. Therefore, the intensities are equal for each of the $2I+1$ components. For $I=1$, the three $m_{I}$ values are $-1,0,+1$, each with equal weight, giving an intensity ratio of\n$$\n1:1:1.\n$$\n\nFourth, verify there is no further splitting. The problem states that long-range coupling between $-CH_{3}$ and $-CH_{2}D$ across the carbonyl is negligible and unresolved, so no additional splitting occurs. The two $CH_{2}$ protons are equivalent and do not split each other, so the $CH_{2}$ signal remains a single pattern: a triplet with equal intensities. The integration (area) reflects two protons, but the internal line ratio remains $1:1:1$.\n\nThus, the proton signal of the $-CH_{2}D$ group is a triplet with a relative intensity ratio of $1:1:1$, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2214966"}]}
