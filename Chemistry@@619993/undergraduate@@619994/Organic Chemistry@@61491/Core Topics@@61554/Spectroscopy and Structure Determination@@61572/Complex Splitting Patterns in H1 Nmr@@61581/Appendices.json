The methine proton at C2 is vicinal to a methyl group (3 equivalent protons, $n=3$) and to a methylene group (2 equivalent protons, $m=2$), yielding a quartet of triplets or triplet of quartets, not a dt. The C3 methylene protons couple to C2–H (1 proton) and to a terminal methyl (3 protons), giving a doublet of quartets or quartet of doublets, not a dt. Methyl protons vicinal to the methine give doublets. Therefore no dt is expected.\n\nB. (E)-Pent-2-ene, CH3–CH=CH–CH2–CH3. Consider the two vinylic protons. The vinylic proton adjacent to the methyl (on C2) couples to the other vinylic proton (1 proton) and to three equivalent methyl protons (3 protons), giving a doublet of quartets (dq). The vinylic proton adjacent to the methylene (on C3) couples to the other vinylic proton (1 proton) and to two equivalent allylic methylene protons (2 protons), giving a doublet of triplets (dt), provided the coupling constants are distinct and resolved.

Therefore no dt is expected.\n\nD. 2,2-Dimethylpropane, (CH3)4C.

This exercise simulates that process by asking you to interpret a named multiplet, a \"triplet of quartets.\" To solve this, you must understand the convention that the multiplet's name reflects the relative magnitudes of the coupling constants ($J$), and connect this to the general principle that three-bond couplings ($^{3}J$) are typically larger than four-bond couplings ($^{4}J$) in acyclic systems [@problem_id:2161146].", "problem": "In the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum of an unknown acyclic organic compound, a signal corresponding to a specific proton, designated H_A, is observed as a \"triplet of quartets\".

If a proton couples to two independent sets of equivalent protons, with $n_{B}$ protons in set H_B and $n_{C}$ protons in set H_C, the total splitting pattern is the product multiplet $(n_{B}+1)\\times(n_{C}+1)$ provided $J_{AB}\\neq J_{AC}$. By standard naming convention for complex multiplets, the larger coupling constant determines the “first” (outer) splitting that is named first. Thus:\n- If $J_{AB}>J_{AC}$, the observed pattern is “(multiplicity from H_B) of (multiplicity from H_C)”.\n- If $J_{AC}>J_{AB}$, the observed pattern is “(multiplicity from H_C) of (multiplicity from H_B)”.\n\nA “triplet of quartets” therefore implies that the larger coupling produces a triplet, hence the larger-$J$ partner must be two equivalent protons, i.e., $n_{B}=2$ for the set that gives the triplet. The smaller coupling then produces the quartet, hence $n_{C}=3$ for the set that gives the quartet. Therefore, the condition for “triplet of quartets” is\n$$\nn_{B}=2,\\quad n_{C}=3,\\quad J_{AB}>J_{AC}.\n$$\n\nNext, invoke the typical distance dependence of proton-proton coupling in acyclic systems: a vicinal three-bond coupling (${}^{3}J$) is generally larger than a four-bond coupling (${}^{4}J$) in aliphatic systems, i.e.,\n$$\n{}^{3}J > {}^{4}J.\n$$\nTherefore, the most plausible assignment consistent with both the naming and the magnitudes is that H_A is vicinal to the group that provides two equivalent neighbors (a methylene, $-\\text{CH}_2-$), and the smaller coupling arises from a four-bond interaction with the group that provides three equivalent neighbors (a methyl, $-\\text{CH}_3-$). This yields $n_{B}=2$ with $J_{AB}$ vicinal and $n_{C}=3$ with $J_{AC}$ four-bond, and therefore $J_{AB}>J_{AC}$, producing a “triplet of quartets.”\n\nEvaluate each option against these criteria:\n- A) Vicinal to $-\\text{CH}_3$ and four-bond to $-\\text{CH}_2-$ with $J_{AB}>J_{AC}$ would give a large quartet (from three vicinal neighbors) split into triplets (from two four-bond neighbors), i.e., “quartet of triplets,” not the observed “triplet of quartets.” Reject.\n- B) Vicinal to $-\\text{CH}_2-$ and four-bond to $-\\text{CH}_3$ with $J_{AB}>J_{AC}$ gives a large triplet (two vicinal neighbors) further split into quartets (three four-bond neighbors), i.e., “triplet of quartets,” and obeys ${}^{3}J>{}^{4}J$. Accept.\n- C) Same neighbor counts as B but asserts $J_{AC}>J_{AB}$, which contradicts the typical ${}^{3}J>{}^{4}J$ relation and would invert the naming to “quartet of triplets.” Reject.\n- D) Vicinal to both $-\\text{CH}_3$ and $-\\text{CH}_2-$; while this could, in principle, give either naming depending on which vicinal $J$ is larger, it does not leverage the typical distance dependence (both are ${}^{3}J$). The prompt asks for the most plausible explanation based on standard distance dependence, favoring a ${}^{3}J$ versus ${}^{4}J$ contrast. Less compelling than B. Reject.\n- E) Geminal to a single proton would give a doublet, not a triplet, so it cannot produce a “triplet of quartets.” Reject.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible and conventionally consistent explanation is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2161146"}, {"introduction": "Sometimes, an observed NMR spectrum can be deceptively simple.

However, upon examining the spectrum, the signal for $H_X$ appears as a clean triplet with a peak intensity ratio of approximately 1:2:1. The measured coupling constant for this apparent triplet is 7.2 Hertz (Hz).

The two coupling constants, $J_{AX}$ and $J_{BX}$, are so similar in magnitude that the two inner peaks of the theoretical four-line doublet of doublets pattern collapse into a single peak of double intensity.\n\nC. The spectrometer used did not have sufficient resolution to distinguish between the four separate peaks of a doublet of doublets, causing them to coalesce into a simpler pattern.\n\nD. The proton $H_X$ is undergoing rapid chemical exchange with a trace amount of acidic impurity in the solvent, which simplifies its splitting pattern to a triplet.\n\nE. One of the protons (either $H_A$ or $H_B$) is too far away from $H_X$ for its coupling to be observed, so $H_X$ is only coupled to one neighboring proton, resulting in a simple doublet that is mistaken for a triplet.", "solution": "We have a first-order three-spin system where $H_X$ couples to two nonequivalent $I=\\frac{1}{2}$ spins, $H_A$ and $H_B$, with coupling constants $J_{AX}$ and $J_{BX}$.
