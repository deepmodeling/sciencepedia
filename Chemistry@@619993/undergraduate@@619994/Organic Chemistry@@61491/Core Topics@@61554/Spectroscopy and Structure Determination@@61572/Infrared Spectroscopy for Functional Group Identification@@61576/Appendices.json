This exercise [@problem_id:2176965] invites you to move beyond empirical rules and apply the simple harmonic oscillator model to a real phenomenon—the isotopic effect.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is used to confirm the success of this isotopic labeling.

The vibrational frequency of a diatomic harmonic oscillator depends on the bond's force constant, $k$, and the reduced mass, $\\mu$, of the two atoms.

The IR shows a strong, sharp absorption at $1695 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$, consistent with a conjugated ketone $\\text{C=O}$ stretch (conjugation lowers the $\\text{C=O}$ wavenumber into the $1680$ to $1700 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$ region). The unexpected feature is a very broad band centered near $3400 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nWe evaluate each option using spectroscopic principles:\n\n1) Option A proposes that the $\\text{KBr}$ pellet is contaminated by moisture. $\\text{KBr}$ is hygroscopic, and absorbed $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ gives a very broad $\\text{O-H}$ stretching band centered near $3400 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$ due to hydrogen bonding and the distribution of hydrogen-bond strengths in the hydrated salt matrix. This is a well-known artifact in pellet IR measurements.\n\n2) Option B suggests the broad band is the first overtone of the $\\text{C=O}$ stretch. The first overtone of a fundamental at $\\tilde{\\nu}_{0} = 1695 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$ would be expected near $2\\tilde{\\nu}_{0} \\approx 2 \\times 1695 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$, i.e., near $3390 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$. However, overtones arise from anharmonicity and are electric-dipole forbidden in the harmonic approximation; their intensities are typically much weaker than the fundamental and they are not characteristically very broad. Observing a “very broad” and conspicuous band is inconsistent with a simple $\\text{C=O}$ overtone, which would be weak and comparatively narrow.\n\n3) Option C suggests pressure-induced tautomerization to the enol. Keto-enol tautomerization requires acid or base catalysis in typical conditions and is not driven by mechanical pressure in a dry, neutral, inorganic salt pellet. In addition, even if a tiny fraction enolized, a free $\\text{O-H}$ stretch would more likely appear as a relatively sharp band near $3600 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$ in the absence of strong hydrogen bonding; a very broad band centered at $3400 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$ implies extensive hydrogen bonding, which is inconsistent with a dry, pure ketone in $\\text{KBr}$ unless adventitious water is present.\n\n4) Option D claims the IR beam breaks $\\text{C-H}$ bonds leading to peroxides. The energy of an IR photon at wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is $E = h c \\tilde{\\nu}$. For vibrational IR (e.g., $\\tilde{\\nu}\\sim 3000$ to $3500 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$), $E$ is orders of magnitude smaller than a typical $\\text{C-H}$ bond dissociation energy $D_{\\text{C-H}}$; qualitatively, $h c \\tilde{\\nu} \\ll D_{\\text{C-H}}$. Therefore the IR beam cannot break $\\text{C-H}$ bonds under normal conditions, and this mechanism is implausible.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible and commonly encountered cause of a very broad band near $3400 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}$ in a $\\text{KBr}$ pellet IR spectrum of a dry ketone is absorbed water in the hygroscopic $\\text{KBr}$ matrix, i.e., Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2176898"}]}
