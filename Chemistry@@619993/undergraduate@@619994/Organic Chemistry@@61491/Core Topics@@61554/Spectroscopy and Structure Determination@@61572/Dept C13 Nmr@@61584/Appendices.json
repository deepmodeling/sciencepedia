Cyclohexane", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the correct structure of a $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$ isomer based on its ¹³C NMR and DEPT spectral data. The solution involves two main stages: first, interpreting the spectral data to deduce the number and type of carbon atoms in the molecule, and second, analyzing each of the proposed structures to see which one matches the deduced information.\n\n**Step 1: Interpretation of the NMR Data**\n\n*   **Broadband ¹³C NMR Spectrum:** This spectrum shows all unique carbon environments in the molecule. The data indicates there are **five** signals, meaning the correct structure must have exactly five magnetically non-equivalent carbon atoms.\n*   **DEPT Spectra Overview:** DEPT experiments are used to determine the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon.\n    *   DEPT-90 only shows signals for methine ($\\text{CH}$) carbons.\n    *   DEPT-135 shows signals for methine ($\\text{CH}$) and methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$) carbons as positive peaks, and signals for methylene ($\\text{CH}_2$) carbons as negative peaks.\n    *   Crucially, quaternary carbons (C, carbons with no attached hydrogens) do not appear in any DEPT spectrum.\n*   **Analyzing the Discrepancy:** The broadband spectrum shows 5 signals, but the DEPT-135 spectrum shows only 4 signals (3 positive + 1 negative). The signal that is present in the broadband spectrum but absent from the DEPT-135 spectrum must correspond to a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the molecule contains **one quaternary (C) carbon**.\n*   **Analyzing the DEPT-90 Spectrum:** The DEPT-90 spectrum shows **one** signal. This directly tells us that the molecule contains exactly **one methine ($\\text{CH}$) carbon**.\n*   **Analyzing the DEPT-135 Spectrum:** This spectrum has one negative peak and three positive peaks.\n    *   The single negative peak indicates the presence of exactly **one methylene ($\\text{CH}_2$) carbon**.\n    *   The three positive peaks correspond to all $\\text{CH}$ and $\\text{CH}_3$ carbons. From the DEPT-90 data, we know one of these positive signals is from a $\\text{CH}$ carbon. Therefore, the remaining $3 - 1 = 2$ positive signals must arise from methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$) carbons. This means the molecule contains **two distinct types of methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$) carbons**. Note that this could mean two single $\\text{CH}_3$ groups in different environments, or one set of equivalent $\\text{CH}_3$ groups and another single $\\text{CH}_3$ group, etc., as long as they produce two separate signals.\n\n**Summary of Required Structural Features:**\nA complete count of the carbon types deduced from the spectra is:\n*   Quaternary (C): 1\n*   Methine ($\\text{CH}$): 1\n*   Methylene ($\\text{CH}_2$): 1\n*   Methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$): 2 distinct signals\nThe total number of unique carbon signals is $1+1+1+2=5$, which matches the broadband spectrum. The total number of carbons in the molecule is 6, so one of the signals must represent two or more chemically equivalent carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Candidate Structures**\n\nNow we evaluate each proposed structure against our summary of required features.\n\n*   **A. 2-methyl-2-pentene:** $\\text{(CH}_3)_2\\text{C=CH-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3$\n    *   **Signal Count:** The carbons are: C1 (the two equivalent methyls on C2), C2 (quaternary), C3 (methine), C4 (methylene), C5 (methyl). This gives a total of 5 unique carbon signals. (Matches)\n    *   **Carbon Types:**\n        *   Quaternary (C): 1 (C2, the vinylic carbon with two methyls). (Matches)\n        *   Methine ($\\text{CH}$): 1 (C3, the other vinylic carbon). (Matches)\n        *   Methylene ($\\text{CH}_2$): 1 (C4). (Matches)\n        *   Methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$): There are two distinct $\\text{CH}_3$ signals: one from the two equivalent methyls at C1, and another from the methyl group at C5. (Matches)\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure is fully consistent with all spectral data.\n\n*   **B. 2-methyl-1-pentene:** $\\text{CH}_2\\text{=C(CH}_3)\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$\n    *   **Signal Count:** All 6 carbons in this molecule are in unique chemical environments. This would give 6 signals in the broadband spectrum.

This conflicts with the required counts of $\\text{CH}$ and $\\text{CH}_2$ groups. (Does not match)\n\n*   **C. 3-methyl-1-pentene:** $\\text{CH}_2\\text{=CHCH(CH}_3)\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$\n    *   **Signal Count:** The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center, making all 6 carbons in the molecule unique. This would give 6 signals. (Does not match, data has 5 signals).\n    *   **Carbon Types:** It has 0 quaternary C, 2 $\\text{CH}$, 2 $\\text{CH}_2$, and 2 $\\text{CH}_3$ groups. This conflicts with the requirement for one quaternary carbon. (Does not match)\n\n*   **D. 4-methyl-1-pentene:** $\\text{CH}_2\\text{=CHCH}_2\\text{CH(CH}_3)_2$\n    *   **Signal Count:** Carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4 are unique. The two methyl groups on C4 are chemically equivalent due to free rotation. This gives a total of 5 unique carbon signals. (Matches)\n    *   **Carbon Types:**\n        *   Quaternary (C): 0. (Does not match, requires 1)\n        *   Methine ($\\text{CH}$): 2 (C2 and C4). (Does not match, requires 1)\n        *   Methylene ($\\text{CH}_2$): 2 (C1 and C3). (Does not match, requires 1)\n        *   Methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$): 1 signal from the two equivalent methyls. (Does not match, requires 2)\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure has the correct number of signals but the wrong types of carbons.\n\n*   **E. Cyclohexane:** $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$\n    *   **Signal Count:** Due to the high symmetry of the molecule (assuming rapid chair-chair interconversion), all six carbons are chemically equivalent. This would result in only **one** signal in the broadband spectrum. (Does not match, data has 5 signals).\n    *   **Carbon Types:** It contains only $\\text{CH}_2$ groups and no C, $\\text{CH}$, or $\\text{CH}_3$ groups. (Does not match)\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nOnly structure A, 2-methyl-2-pentene, is consistent with all the provided ¹³C NMR and DEPT data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2166624"}]}
