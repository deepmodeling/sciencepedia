Electronegative atoms can withdraw electron density from nearby protons, an effect known as deshielding, which results in a higher chemical shift value (a downfield shift). Consider the structures of ethanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$) and diethyl ether ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$). Your task is to compare the expected ¹H NMR chemical shift of the methylene protons (-CH₂-) directly bonded to the oxygen atom in each molecule.

The $\\alpha$-protons of ethanol will have a higher chemical shift (be more deshielded) than those of diethyl ether. This is because the electron-donating nature of the second alkyl group in the ether makes its oxygen slightly less electron-withdrawing than the oxygen in the alcohol's hydroxyl group.\n\nB.

This is because the presence of two alkyl groups attached to the oxygen in the ether enhances its ability to withdraw electron density.\n\nC. The chemical shifts of the $\\alpha$-protons in both molecules will be virtually identical, as they are both attached to a carbon bonded to an oxygen atom, making the inductive effects the same.\n\nD. The $\\alpha$-protons of ethanol will have a higher chemical shift primarily because the hydroxyl proton (-OH) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which significantly deshields the neighboring methylene group protons.", "solution": "In ¹H NMR, a proton’s resonance frequency depends on the effective magnetic field at the nucleus, given by $B_{\\text{eff}} = B_0(1 - \\sigma)$, where $\\sigma$ is the electronic shielding constant. The resonance frequency is $\\nu = \\frac{\\gamma B_{\\text{eff}}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\gamma B_0}{2\\pi}(1 - \\sigma)$, so a decrease in $\\sigma$ (deshielding) increases $\\nu$.

Comparing ethanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$) with diethyl ether ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$), the key difference is the substituents on oxygen:\n- In ethanol, oxygen is bound to hydrogen. Hydrogen does not donate electron density by the inductive effect; thus, the oxygen remains relatively electron-withdrawing, causing stronger deshielding of the adjacent $\\alpha$-methylene protons. Symbolically, this corresponds to a smaller $\\sigma_{\\alpha,\\text{EtOH}}$ and hence a larger $\\delta_{\\alpha,\\text{EtOH}}$.\n- In diethyl ether, oxygen is bound to two alkyl groups. Alkyl groups are net electron-donating via the inductive effect, which partially offsets oxygen’s electron-withdrawing tendency. This increases the local shielding at the adjacent $\\alpha$-methylene protons, so $\\sigma_{\\alpha,\\text{Et}_2\\text{O}} > \\sigma_{\\alpha,\\text{EtOH}}$ and therefore $\\delta_{\\alpha,\\text{Et}_2\\text{O}}  \\delta_{\\alpha,\\text{EtOH}}$.\n\nHydrogen bonding strongly affects the chemical shift of the hydroxyl proton itself, but its effect on the neighboring $\\alpha$-methylene protons is comparatively small and not the primary determinant when comparing an alcohol to an ether. Hence the dominant factor is the difference in inductive effects due to the substituents on oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the correct comparison is\n$$\n\\delta_{\\alpha,\\text{EtOH}} > \\delta_{\\alpha,\\text{Et}_2\\text{O}},\n$$\nwith the reasoning that the second alkyl group in the ether donates electron density and makes the ether oxygen less electron-withdrawing than the alcohol’s hydroxyl oxygen.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A correctly states both the trend and the inductive reasoning.\n- B incorrectly claims enhanced electron withdrawal by two alkyl groups; alkyl groups are inductively donating.\n- C ignores the differing substituents on oxygen and thus different inductive effects.\n- D overstates hydrogen bonding as the primary cause for the $\\alpha$-methylene shift; it is not the dominant factor compared to the inductive difference.\n\nThus, A is the most accurate statement and reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2159373"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the influence of nearby electronegative atoms, a proton's chemical shift can be dramatically affected by non-local effects like magnetic anisotropy.

A powerful effect observed in cyclic, conjugated molecules is the induced ring current generated in the presence of an external magnetic field.

Conversely, planar, anti-aromatic systems, with $4n$ $\\pi$-electrons, are predicted to generate a paramagnetic ring current.\n\nYou are asked to predict the ¹H NMR characteristics of two four-membered ring isomers: cyclobutadiene and cyclobutene.

Shielding corresponds to $B_{\\text{ind}}0$ (opposing $B_0$), lowering $\\delta$, while deshielding corresponds to $B_{\\text{ind}}>0$ (augmenting $B_0$), raising $\\delta$.\n\nIn cyclic conjugated systems under $B_0$, ring currents are induced. By Hückel’s rule, aromatic systems with $(4n+2)$ $\\pi$-electrons are diatropic: outside the ring, $B_{\\text{ind}}>0$, leading to deshielding (downfield), and inside the ring, $B_{\\text{ind}}0$, leading to shielding (upfield). Planar antiaromatic systems with $4n$ $\\pi$-electrons are paratropic: the directions reverse, so outside the ring, $B_{\\text{ind}}0$ (shielding, upfield), and inside the ring, $B_{\\text{ind}}>0$ (deshielding, downfield).\n\nCyclobutadiene is planar and antiaromatic with $4\\pi$ electrons. Its C–H protons lie outside the ring current path. For a paratropic current, the outside region experiences $B_{\\text{ind}}0$, so $B_{\\text{eff}}$ is reduced and the protons are strongly shielded, giving an unusually low $\\delta$ for olefinic protons (significantly upfield relative to typical vinyl values).\n\nCyclobutene is nonplanar and nonaromatic, so there is no significant global ring current. Its chemical shifts are governed by local anisotropy: the vinylic protons on the C=C appear in the standard olefinic region, while the saturated ring protons appear in the usual aliphatic region. There is no reason to expect all protons to be strongly shielded into the low aliphatic region solely due to ring strain.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A and D incorrectly predict deshielding for cyclobutadiene’s outside protons; antiaromatic paratropic currents shield outside protons.\n- C wrongly asserts similar regions for both molecules, ignoring the strong paratropic effect in cyclobutadiene and the absence of a ring current in cyclobutene.\n- E incorrectly claims that all cyclobutene protons shift into the aliphatic region; vinylic protons remain in the typical olefinic region.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that cyclobutadiene’s protons are strongly shielded (unusually upfield for olefinic protons), while cyclobutene shows separate olefinic and aliphatic signals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2159399"}]}
