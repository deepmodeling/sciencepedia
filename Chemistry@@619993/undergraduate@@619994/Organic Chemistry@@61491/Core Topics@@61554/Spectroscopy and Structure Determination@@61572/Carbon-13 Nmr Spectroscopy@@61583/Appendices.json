The molecule possesses an effective mirror plane containing the 1–4 axis of the ring. This plane reflects C2 into C6 and C3 into C5, while leaving C1 and C4 distinct because the substituents differ. Fast rotation about the C–C bond of the methyl group and about the O–C bonds in the isopropoxy group preserves this effective symmetry on the NMR timescale.\n\nTherefore, among the six aromatic carbons:\n- $\\text{C}_2$ and $\\text{C}_6$ are equivalent,\n- $\\text{C}_3$ and $\\text{C}_5$ are equivalent,\n- $\\text{C}_1$ (ipso to methyl) and $\\text{C}_4$ (ipso to isopropoxy) are distinct.\n\nThis yields $4$ unique aromatic carbon signals.\n\nFor the substituents:\n- The ring methyl group contributes $1$ unique methyl carbon signal.\n- The isopropoxy group has one methine carbon ($\\text{O–CH}$) giving $1$ signal, and two methyl carbons attached to that methine that are equivalent by symmetry/rapid rotation, giving $1$ signal.\n\nHence, the total number of $^{13}\\text{C}$ signals is\n$$\n4\\;(\\text{aromatic}) \\;+\\; 1\\;(\\text{ring methyl}) \\;+\\; 2\\;(\\text{isopropoxy}) \\;=\\; 7.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "1429577"}, {"introduction": "After determining the number of unique carbons, the next clue in solving a structure is the position of each signal, known as its chemical shift ($\\delta$).
