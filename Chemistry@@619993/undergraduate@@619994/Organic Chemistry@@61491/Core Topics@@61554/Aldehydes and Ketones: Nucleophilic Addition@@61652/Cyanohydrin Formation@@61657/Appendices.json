Your task is to provide the systematic International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for this major organic product.", "solution": "The reaction described is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The reactants are cyclopentanone and hydrogen cyanide (HCN).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the nature of the reaction.**\nThe reactants are cyclopentanone, a five-membered cyclic ketone, and hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. The base catalyst (e.g., $CN^-$ from NaCN or KCN, which is often used as the source of HCN in situ) deprotonates HCN to generate the cyanide anion ($CN^-$), a potent nucleophile.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the mechanism and structure of the product.**\nThe cyanide anion ($CN^-$) acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the carbonyl group in cyclopentanone. The $\\pi$-bond of the carbonyl group breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, creating a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\nThis intermediate is an anion: an oxygen atom with a negative charge attached to a cyclopentane ring, where the same carbon atom is also bonded to a cyano group ($-CN$).\nIn the second step, this alkoxide intermediate is protonated by a proton source, which is HCN in this case (or water if present), to yield the final neutral product.\nThe resulting product has a cyclopentane ring where one carbon atom is bonded to both a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) and a cyano or nitrile group ($-CN$).\n\n**Step 3: Apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name the product.**\nTo determine the IUPAC name, we must identify the principal functional group, the parent hydrocarbon structure, and any substituents.\n\n**3a. Identify the principal functional group.**\nThe product contains two functional groups: a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) and a nitrile group ($-CN$). According to IUPAC priority rules, the nitrile group has higher priority than the hydroxyl group. Therefore, the suffix of the name will be determined by the nitrile group.\n\n**3b. Determine the parent structure and suffix.**\nWhen a $-CN$ group is attached directly to a cyclic system, the suffix \"-carbonitrile\" is appended to the name of the ring system. The parent ring is cyclopentane. Thus, the parent name is cyclopentanecarbonitrile.\n\n**3c. Number the parent chain (the ring).**\nThe carbon atom of the ring to which the principal functional group (-carbonitrile) is attached is designated as carbon 1.\n\n**3d. Identify and name the substituents.**\nThe hydroxyl group ($-OH$) is located on carbon 1. Since it is treated as a substituent (due to the higher priority of the nitrile group), its prefix is \"hydroxy\".\n\n**3e. Assemble the complete IUPAC name.**\nCombining the pieces: the substituent at position 1 is \"1-hydroxy\", and the parent structure is \"cyclopentanecarbonitrile\". Therefore, the full systematic IUPAC name for the product is 1-hydroxycyclopentanecarbonitrile.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{1-hydroxycyclopentanecarbonitrile}}$$", "id": "2165312"}, {"introduction": "Organic reactions occur in a three-dimensional world, and understanding their stereochemical outcomes is crucial for modern organic synthesis. This problem moves beyond simple structure prediction to explore the concept of diastereoselectivity.

Mechanistically, base generates $CN^-$ from HCN, which adds to the planar $sp^2$ carbonyl carbon to give a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate; subsequent protonation yields the alcohol. Applied to (R)-3-methylcyclopentanone, this proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Identify the substrate and stereocenter: In cyclopentanone, the carbonyl carbon is numbered C1. The methyl substituent at C3 makes C3 a stereogenic center because the two ring paths from C3 are not equivalent due to the carbonyl. The starting material is specified as $(R)$ at C3, so C3 is fixed as $3R$.\n\n2. Site of reaction and creation of a new stereocenter: Cyanide adds to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), converting it from $sp^2$ to $sp^3$ and installing $-\\text{OH}$ and $-\\text{CN}$ at C1. This creates a new stereogenic center at C1.\n\n3. Facial selectivity and diastereomers: The carbonyl group is trigonal planar, so nucleophilic attack by $CN^-$ can occur from either face. Because the substrate is already chiral at C3, the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic, and two diastereomeric products form. The configuration at C3 does not change during the reaction because no bond at C3 is broken; thus C3 remains $R$.\n\n4. Product identities and names: The products are epimers at C1 with C3 retained as $R$, giving the pair $(1R,3R)$ and $(1S,3R)$ of the cyanohydrin. The correct IUPAC name for the cyanohydrin derived from cyclopentanone with a methyl at C3 is 1-cyano-1-hydroxy-3-methylcyclopentane. Therefore, the products are:\n- $(1R,3R)$-1-cyano-1-hydroxy-3-methylcyclopentane,\n- $(1S,3R)$-1-cyano-1-hydroxy-3-methylcyclopentane.\n\n5.
