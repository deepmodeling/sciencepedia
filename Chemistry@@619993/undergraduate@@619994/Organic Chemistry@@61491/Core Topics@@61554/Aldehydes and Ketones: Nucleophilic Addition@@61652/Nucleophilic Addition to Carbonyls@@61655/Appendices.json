The relevant principle is hydride stoichiometry: each $\\mathrm{B\\!-\\!H}$ bond in $\\mathrm{BH_{4}^{-}}$ can deliver one hydride to one carbonyl group, and each carbonyl requires exactly one hydride to be reduced to an alcohol.\n\nThe anion $\\mathrm{BH_{4}^{-}}$ contains four $\\mathrm{B\\!-\\!H}$ bonds; therefore, in the ideal, complete-conversion limit with no side reactions, one mole of $\\mathrm{NaBH_{4}}$ can donate four moles of hydride, reducing four moles of formaldehyde.

For 2-butanone (an achiral, prochiral ketone), the carbonyl carbon is $sp^{2}$ hybridized and trigonal planar, so the $\\pi$-bonded $C=O$ can be approached from either the re or si face.\n\nMechanistic steps:\n1) Hydride transfer: a hydride ion from $LiAlH_4$ adds to the carbonyl carbon of 2-butanone, converting the $sp^{2}$ carbonyl carbon to an $sp^{3}$ alkoxide (tetrahedral) intermediate.\n2) Workup: protonation of the alkoxide by dilute aqueous acid yields 2-butanol.\n\nStereochemical consequences:\n- The newly formed carbon (C2) in 2-butanol becomes a stereogenic center. Addition of hydride to the re versus si face produces the two enantiomers, $(R)$-2-butanol and $(S)$-2-butanol.\n- In an achiral environment with an achiral reagent ($LiAlH_4$) and achiral solvent and conditions, the two faces of an achiral, prochiral ketone are enantiotopic and are indistinguishable by symmetry. Therefore, hydride adds with equal probability to both faces, giving an equal mixture of the two enantiomers (a racemic mixture).\n- A racemic mixture is optically inactive because the rotations cancel. Writing the observed rotation as\n$$\n[\\alpha]_{\\text{mix}}=\\frac{n_{R}[\\alpha]_{R}+n_{S}[\\alpha]_{S}}{n_{R}+n_{S}},\n$$\nand using $[\\alpha]_{S}=-[\\alpha]_{R}$ with $n_{R}=n_{S}$ (equal mixture), we obtain\n$$\n[\\alpha]_{\\text{mix}}=0.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the final product mixture is an equal mixture of two enantiomers and is optically inactive.

This name indicates a five-carbon chain (pent-) with a ketone (`-one`) at C2 as the principal functional group and a hydroxyl group (`hydroxy-`) at C5.\nStructure of 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone: $CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-OH$\n\nComparing the two structures, the required transformation is the selective reduction of the aldehyde functional group ($-CHO$) to a primary alcohol ($-CH_2OH$), while leaving the ketone functional group ($-C(=O)-$) unchanged.\n\n**Evaluating the Synthetic Options**\n\nThe primary challenge is chemoselectivity. Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones towards nucleophilic attack, including reduction by hydride reagents like sodium borohydride ($NaBH_4$).\n\n**Option B:** This sequence attempts a direct selective reduction.\n$CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_2-CHO$ --(1. $NaBH_4$, $CH_3OH$; 2. $H_3O^+$)--> ?\nSince aldehydes are more reactive towards $NaBH_4$ than ketones, this reaction can work, especially under controlled conditions (e.g., low temperature, limited stoichiometry). However, over-reduction to the diol ($CH_3-CH(OH)-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2OH$) is a significant risk, making this route less controlled and potentially lower-yielding than a strategy involving a protecting group. In the context of designing a robust synthesis, this is a less ideal choice.\n\n**Option C:** This sequence uses a Grignard reagent, $CH_3MgBr$.\n$CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_2-CHO$ --(1. $CH_3MgBr$, THF; 2. $H_3O^+$)--> ?\nGrignard reagents are strong nucleophiles that add to carbonyls. It would preferentially attack the more reactive aldehyde, adding a methyl group and forming a secondary alcohol upon workup. The product would be `6-hydroxy-3-hexanone` ($CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_2-CH(OH)-CH_3$). This is not the target product.\n\n**Option E:** This sequence uses Tollen's reagent.\n$CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_2-CHO$ --(1. $Ag_2O$, $NH_4OH$; 2. $H_3O^+$)--> ?\nTollen's reagent is a mild oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic acids in the presence of ketones. The product would be 4-oxopentanoic acid ($CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_2-COOH$). This is an oxidation, not the required reduction.\n\n**The Protecting Group Strategy (Options A and D)**\n\nTo guarantee selectivity, the functional group that should not react (the ketone) must be masked while the other group (the aldehyde) is transformed. The strategy should be:\n1.  **Protect** the ketone.\n2.  **Reduce** the unmasked aldehyde.\n3.  **Deprotect** the ketone to restore it.\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  $HOCH_2CH_2OH$, catalytic $p$-TsOH: This step protects a carbonyl group. The strategy requires protecting the ketone. While aldehydes are often more reactive kinetically, selective protection of the ketone is synthetically feasible (e.g., under thermodynamic control). With the ketone masked, the aldehyde is free.\n    Intermediate: $CH_3-C(O-CH_2-CH_2-O)-CH_2-CH_2-CHO$\n2.  $NaBH_4$ in $CH_3OH$: This hydride reagent will now reduce the only available carbonyl group, the aldehyde, to a primary alcohol.\n    Intermediate: $CH_3-C(O-CH_2-CH_2-O)-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2OH$\n3.  $H_3O^+$, $H_2O$: Aqueous acid hydrolyzes the acetal, deprotecting it and restoring the ketone.\n    Product: $CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-OH$\n\nThis sequence perfectly matches the required strategic logic for a robust, selective synthesis and yields the correct target product.\n\n**Option D:**\n1.  $HOCH_2CH_2OH$, catalytic $p$-TsOH: This step protects the ketone.\n    Intermediate: $CH_3-C(O-CH_2-CH_2-O)-CH_2-CH_2-CHO$\n2.  $H_3O^+$, $H_2O$: This step immediately deprotects the acetal, regenerating the starting material, 4-oxopentanal.\n3.  $NaBH_4$ in $CH_3OH$: This step then attempts to reduce the unprotected starting material, leading to the same potential lack of selectivity as in Option B.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the sequence in Option A follows the correct synthetic logic of protection, transformation, and deprotection to achieve the desired chemoselective reduction in a controlled manner.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2185734"}]}
