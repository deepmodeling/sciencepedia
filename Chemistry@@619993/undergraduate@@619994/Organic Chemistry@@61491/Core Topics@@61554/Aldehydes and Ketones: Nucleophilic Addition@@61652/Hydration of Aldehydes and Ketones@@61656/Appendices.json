The rate-determining step in neutral solution is the nucleophilic attack of water on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon:\n$$\\text{R}_{2}C=O + H_{2}O \\xrightarrow{k} \\text{R}_{2}C(OH)_{2}.$$\n\nThe rate constant $k$ for this addition increases with:\n1) Higher electrophilicity at the carbonyl carbon (greater partial positive charge), and\n2) Lower steric hindrance at the carbonyl carbon (easier approach of the nucleophile).\n\nElectronic effect: Alkyl groups are weakly electron-donating by induction and hyperconjugation; each alkyl substituent decreases the partial positive character at the carbonyl carbon, lowering its electrophilicity and thereby decreasing the rate of nucleophilic attack. Therefore, with zero, one, and two alkyl groups, the electrophilicity and thus the rate follow:\n$$\\text{formaldehyde} > \\text{acetaldehyde} > \\text{acetone}.$$\n\nSteric effect: Increasing the number and size of substituents on the carbonyl carbon hinders the approach of water, further decreasing the rate in the same order:\n$$\\text{formaldehyde} > \\text{acetaldehyde} > \\text{acetone}.$$\n\nCombining both effects, the overall relative rates satisfy\n$$k_{\\text{formaldehyde}} > k_{\\text{acetaldehyde}} > k_{\\text{acetone}},$$\nwhich corresponds to the ranking\n$$\\text{Formaldehyde} > \\text{Acetaldehyde} > \\text{Acetone}.$$\n\nMatching this to the given options gives option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2175425"}, {"introduction": "Beyond a reaction's speed, we must also consider how far it proceeds toward completion.

This practice provides a direct, hands-on opportunity to translate this abstract constant into the tangible distribution of species at equilibrium, allowing you to calculate the precise fraction of a compound that exists in its hydrate form [@problem_id:2175403].", "problem": "The hydration of carbonyl compounds is a fundamental reversible reaction in organic chemistry where an aldehyde or ketone reacts with water to form a geminal diol, also known as a hydrate. The position of this equilibrium is highly dependent on the structure of the carbonyl compound.\n\nConsider a specific halogenated aromatic aldehyde that is used as a chemical intermediate. When this aldehyde is dissolved in an aqueous solution at 25 Â°C, it establishes an equilibrium with its hydrate form. The hydration equilibrium constant, $K_{hydr}$, for this reaction is defined as the ratio of the hydrate concentration to the aldehyde concentration at equilibrium, incorporating the constant concentration of the solvent (water) into its value. For this particular aldehyde, the value of $K_{hydr}$ is determined to be 4.0.\n\nCalculate the fraction of the total amount of this compound (i.e., the sum of the aldehyde and hydrate forms) that exists as the hydrate at equilibrium.

The reverse reaction, the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a gem-diol, regenerates the ketone.

Specifically, starting from propane-2,2-diol $(CH_3)_2C(OH)_2$, the first step is protonation of one hydroxyl group to convert it into a better leaving group, giving the oxonium ion $(CH_3)_2C(OH)(OH_2^+)$. This species corresponds to the initial acid-activated intermediate and is correctly described by option B, but it is not yet the resonance-stabilized carbocation.\n\nNext, loss of water from the protonated diol generates a cation adjacent to oxygen. The resulting cation is an oxocarbenium ion that is best represented as a resonance hybrid of two contributors:\n$$(CH_3)_2C^+-OH \\leftrightarrow (CH_3)_2C=O^+H.$$\nIn the first form, the positive charge resides on carbon with a neutral $OH$ substituent; in the second, a C=O double bond is formed and the positive charge resides on oxygen as an $O^{+}H$ group. Delocalization of the positive charge between carbon and oxygen stabilizes this intermediate. This resonance-stabilized cation is the key intermediate that then undergoes deprotonation at oxygen to yield acetone $(CH_3)_2C=O$ and regenerate $H^+$.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incomplete because it ignores resonance stabilization.\n- Option B is the protonated diol before the key step of water loss and is not the resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate.\n- Option C correctly describes the oxocarbenium ion as a resonance hybrid of $(CH_3)_2C^+-OH$ and $(CH_3)_2C=O^+H$.\n- Option D is the enol tautomer of acetone, not the carbocation intermediate.\n- Option E proposes a carbanion, which is inconsistent with the strongly acidic, dehydration mechanism.\n\nHence, the correct description is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2175405"}]}
