When an unsymmetrical ketone is used, the regioselectivity of the oxygen atom insertion is determined by the relative migratory aptitude of the two groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. The generally accepted order of migratory aptitude for alkyl groups is: tertiary > secondary > primary > methyl.\n\nConsider the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of 2-pentanone ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CO-CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$).

In the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, the peroxyacid inserts an oxygen between the carbonyl carbon and one of the two substituents. If $R^2$ migrates, the product is $R^1\\text{-CO-O-}R^2$. If $R^1$ migrates, the product is $R^2\\text{-CO-O-}R^1$. The regioselectivity follows the migratory aptitude order: tertiary > secondary > primary > methyl. Here, the two competing groups are the n-propyl group (a primary alkyl group) and the methyl group. Based on the migratory aptitude order, the primary n-propyl group ($R^2$) has a higher migratory aptitude and migrates preferentially over the methyl group ($R^1$).\n\nHowever, the question asks for the two *possible* esters that can be formed.

The stereocenter is the benzylic carbon $\\text{CH(Ph)}$ adjacent to the carbonyl.\n\nBaeyer-Villiger oxidation of an unsymmetrical ketone $R\\text{-CO-}R'$ with a peroxyacid inserts an oxygen adjacent to the carbonyl to give an ester.
