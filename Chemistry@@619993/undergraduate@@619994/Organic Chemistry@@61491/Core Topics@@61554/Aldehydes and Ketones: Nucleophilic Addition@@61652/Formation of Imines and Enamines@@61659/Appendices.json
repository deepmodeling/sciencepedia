Propyl cyclobutanecarboxylate", "solution": "- Reaction type and driving force:\n  The reaction of a ketone (cyclobutanone) with a primary amine (propan-1-amine) under acid catalysis forms an imine (a Schiff base). The catalytic acid (p-toluenesulfonic acid) protonates the carbonyl to enhance electrophilicity, and the Dean–Stark apparatus continuously removes water, shifting the equilibrium toward imine formation by Le Châtelier’s principle.\n\n- Mechanistic steps (qualitative, standard imine formation from a ketone and a primary amine):\n  1) Protonation of the ketone carbonyl oxygen by the acid catalyst increases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon.\n  2) Nucleophilic attack by the primary amine nitrogen on the carbonyl carbon forms a tetrahedral carbinolamine intermediate.\n  3) Proton transfers within the intermediate activate the hydroxyl group as a leaving group, and loss of water gives an iminium ion.\n  4) Deprotonation at nitrogen yields the neutral imine (a ketimine).\n\n- Product identity:\n  Because a primary amine is used, the major product is an imine, not an enamine (which would require a secondary amine). No reducing agent is present, so the carbonyl is not reduced to an amine. No conditions for amide or ester formation are present. The imine formed from cyclobutanone and propan-1-amine corresponds to the structure R_{cyclobutanone}C=NR' where R' is propyl. The IUPAC name for this ketimine is N-cyclobutylidenepropan-1-amine.\n\n- Evaluation of options:\n  A. N-Propylcyclobutanamine: requires reduction (reductive amination), not present here.\n  B. 1-(Propylamino)cyclobut-1-ene: an enamine product; secondary amines give enamines, not primary amines.\n  C. N-Cyclobutylidenepropan-1-amine: correct imine (ketimine) from cyclobutanone and propan-1-amine.\n  D. N-Cyclobutylpropanamide: an amide, not formed under these conditions.\n  E. Propyl cyclobutanecarboxylate: an ester, unrelated to this transformation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2171612"}, {"introduction": "Real-world organic synthesis often involves molecules with multiple reactive sites, requiring a keen understanding of chemoselectivity.

Solving this problem sharpens your ability to assess the relative reactivity of aldehydes and ketones, a crucial aspect of predictive organic chemistry.", "problem": "A chemist is investigating selective functional group transformations on a bifunctional molecule. The reaction involves treating 4-oxopentanal with exactly one equivalent of propylamine in a suitable solvent containing a catalytic amount of a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid.

The substrate 4-oxopentanal is a bifunctional 1,4-dicarbonyl compound bearing an aldehyde at C1 and a methyl ketone at C4. Under acid-catalyzed conditions, primary amines condense with carbonyl compounds to form imines (Schiff bases) via the standard sequence: reversible carbonyl protonation, nucleophilic addition of the amine to form a carbinolamine, and acid-catalyzed dehydration to the imine. This general transformation can be summarized for an aldehyde as\n$$\n\\text{R-CHO} + \\text{H}_2\\text{NPr} \\xrightarrow[\\text{cat.}]{\\text{acid}} \\text{R-CH=NPr} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n$$.\n\nEstablish chemoselectivity. Aldehydes are more electrophilic and less sterically hindered than ketones. Under catalytic acid, both carbonyls are activated, but the aldehyde remains more reactive toward nucleophilic addition by a primary amine than the ketone. Therefore, when exactly one equivalent of amine is present, the aldehyde reacts preferentially and consumes the amine to form the corresponding imine, leaving the ketone unreacted.\n\nApply stoichiometry. Because only one equivalent of propylamine is used, formation of a diimine is precluded. Primary amines do not give enamines with carbonyls (that outcome requires secondary amines), so enamine-type products are not expected. Intramolecular condensations such as Paal–Knorr-type cyclizations are not favored here under the stated conditions with a mixed keto–aldehyde and exactly one equivalent of amine; the dominant, fastest process is the formation of the aldehyde-derived imine.\n\nTranslate the structure into the correct IUPAC name. The product is the imine formed at C1 (the aldehyde carbon) with the ketone at C4 retained. The correct IUPAC name for this is N-Propyl-4-oxopentan-1-imine.\n\nExclude the alternatives:\n- A implies imine formation at the ketone with the aldehyde intact, which is disfavored relative to aldehyde imine formation.\n- C requires two equivalents of amine to form a diimine, which contradicts the stated stoichiometry.\n- D describes an enamine-type product at C1, which does not arise from a primary amine.\n- E proposes a cyclic hemiaminal/tetrahydropyridine derivative, which is not the major product under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2171627"}, {"introduction": "Moving from primary to secondary amines changes the reaction outcome from an imine to an enamine, a versatile synthetic intermediate.

The Dean-Stark apparatus removes water, driving the equilibrium toward the enamine product. Because PTSA provides reversible acid catalysis and the system is heated with continuous water removal, the product distribution reflects thermodynamic control.\n\n2) Mechanistic outline:\n- Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen increases electrophilicity.\n- Nucleophilic attack by morpholine on the carbonyl carbon forms a tetrahedral intermediate.\n- Proton transfers lead to an iminium ion at C-1.\n- Deprotonation at an alpha position gives the enamine by forming a C=C adjacent to nitrogen and expelling water overall.\n\n3) Possible enamine regioisomers:\n- Deprotonation at C-2 (the methyl-bearing alpha carbon) gives a C=C between C-1 and C-2. In this enamine, the alkene is more substituted: at C-2, there are two carbon substituents (ring carbon and methyl), and at C-1, there is one carbon substituent (ring carbon) in addition to nitrogen. Overall, this alkene is trisubstituted.\n- Deprotonation at C-6 (the other alpha carbon) gives a C=C between C-1 and C-6. Here, each alkene carbon has only one carbon substituent (ring carbon at C-6 and ring carbon at C-1, with nitrogen as the other substituent at C-1), making the alkene disubstituted.\n\n4) Thermodynamic control rationalization:\n- Under thermodynamic control, the more substituted (and thus more stable) alkene is favored. Therefore, the enamine with the C=C between C-1 and C-2 (trisubstituted) predominates over the C-1 to C-6 enamine (disubstituted).\n- Morpholine being a secondary amine rules out an imine product; imines arise from primary amines. Likewise, simple N-alkylation without reduction is not expected under these conditions.\n\n5) Match to the options:\n- The enamine with C=C between C-1 and C-2, retaining the methyl at C-2, corresponds to 4-(2-methylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)morpholine, which is option A.\n- The alternative enamine (double bond on the other side) is represented by 4-(6-methylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)morpholine (option B), which is less substituted and thus not the major product.\n- Options C, D, and E correspond to structures inconsistent with the enamine outcome from a secondary amine under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the major product at thermodynamic equilibrium is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2171620"}]}
