This practice delves into the factors governing the rate of carbonyl reduction by comparing two isomeric ketones. By analyzing their structures, you will develop an intuition for how steric hindrance and electronic effects influence the accessibility of the carbonyl carbon to the incoming nucleophile, a fundamental skill for predicting the outcomes of competitive reactions [@problem_id:2195165].", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying the reactivity of isomeric ketones. A competition experiment is designed where an equimolar mixture of 2-heptanone and 3-heptanone is treated with a limited amount of Sodium Borohydride ($\\text{NaBH}_4$) in a methanol solvent at room temperature. The reaction is stopped before completion to analyze the relative amounts of the starting materials and products. Based on the principles of reaction kinetics for nucleophilic addition to carbonyls, which of the following statements correctly predicts the outcome and provides the primary reason for it?\n\nA. 2-heptanone reacts faster due to less steric hindrance around the carbonyl group.\n\nB. 3-heptanone reacts faster due to less steric hindrance around the carbonyl group.\n\nC. 2-heptanone reacts faster because its carbonyl group is more electrophilic.\n\nD. 3-heptanone reacts faster because its carbonyl group is more electrophilic.\n\nE. Both ketones react at the same rate as they are constitutional isomers with the same molecular weight.", "solution": "We consider a competitive nucleophilic addition of hydride from $\\text{BH}_{4}^{-}$ to the carbonyl carbon. For each ketone $i$, the initial rate is\n$$\nv_{i}=k_{i}[\\text{ketone}_{i}][\\text{BH}_{4}^{-}]\\,.\n$$\nWith an equimolar mixture of 2-heptanone and 3-heptanone, and identical $[\\text{BH}_{4}^{-}]$ for both pathways at the outset, the ratio of initial rates reduces to\n$$\n\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{3}}=\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{3}}\\,.\n$$\nThus, the faster-reacting ketone is the one with the larger rate constant $k$.\n\nBy the Arrhenius relation,\n$$\nk=A\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{a}}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\na lower activation energy $E_{\\text{a}}$ gives a larger $k$. For nucleophilic attack at a ketone carbonyl, $E_{\\text{a}}$ increases with steric hindrance around the carbonyl carbon and decreases with electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. Comparing structures:\n- 2-heptanone has a methyl and an $n$-pentyl substituent on the carbonyl carbon.\n- 3-heptanone has an ethyl and an $n$-butyl substituent on the carbonyl carbon.\n\nSterically, a methyl group is smaller than an ethyl group; therefore, the carbonyl carbon in 2-heptanone is less hindered in the approach trajectory of the nucleophile. This lowers $E_{\\text{a}}$ for 2-heptanone relative to 3-heptanone, so\n$$\nE_{\\text{a,2}}<E_{\\text{a,3}}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad k_{2}>k_{3}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad v_{2}>v_{3}.\n$$\nElectronically, alkyl groups donate electron density by induction and hyperconjugation; an ethyl group donates slightly more than a methyl group. Hence 3-heptanone is also slightly less electrophilic than 2-heptanone. Both effects favor faster reaction of 2-heptanone, but the primary controlling factor for the rate of nucleophilic addition in this comparison is steric hindrance at the carbonyl carbon.\n\nTherefore, 2-heptanone reacts faster, primarily due to less steric hindrance around the carbonyl group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2195165"}, {"introduction": "In organic synthesis, molecules often possess multiple functional groups, and a key challenge is to modify one while leaving others untouched.

The reagent $NaBH_{4}$ in $CH_{3}OH$ acts as a nucleophilic hydride source that is chemoselective for carbonyl reduction under these conditions and does not reduce an isolated or conjugated alkene.\n\nStep 1: Hydride delivery from $BH_{4}^{-}$ to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon (C2) proceeds via 1,2-addition, forming the corresponding alkoxide at C2. The conjugated C3=C4 alkene remains intact because $NaBH_{4}$ under these conditions does not effect hydrogenation or 1,4-reduction of the enone as the major pathway.\n\nStep 2: Protonation of the alkoxide by the protic solvent $CH_{3}OH$ and during the aqueous workup converts the alkoxide into the secondary alcohol at C2.\n\nThe reaction therefore converts the enone to the corresponding allylic secondary alcohol without altering the C3=C4 double bond geometry. The major product is the allylic alcohol retaining the original (E) configuration at the alkene: (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol.\n\nThus, the correct IUPAC name for the major product is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2195191"}, {"introduction": "This practice challenges you to think like a synthetic chemist planning a multi-step transformation.

The target, 4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexan-1-one, corresponds to selective reduction of the aldehyde to a primary alcohol while leaving the ketone intact.\n\nFor Route A, step 1 treats the dicarbonyl with one equivalent of ethylene glycol and a catalytic acid (TsOH) under dehydrating conditions (heated toluene). Under acid-catalyzed acetalization, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones; therefore, with a limiting amount of diol, the aldehyde preferentially forms a cyclic acetal, while the ketone remains unprotected. In step 2, $NaBH_{4}$ in methanol reduces carbonyls but not acetals; thus, the unprotected ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, while the aldehyde remains masked as an acetal. In step 3, dilute aqueous acid ($H_{3}O^{+}$) hydrolyzes the acetal, regenerating the aldehyde. The net outcome of Route A is reduction of the ketone only, giving 4-hydroxycyclohexanecarbaldehyde rather than the desired 4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\nFor Route B, direct treatment with one equivalent of $NaBH_{4}$ in methanol at $0~^\\circ\\text{C}$ exploits the inherent chemoselectivity of hydride reduction: aldehydes are reduced faster than ketones. Under these mild, low-temperature, and stoichiometrically limiting conditions, the aldehyde is preferentially reduced to the primary alcohol, while the ketone is largely preserved. The mild acid wash workup protonates alkoxide intermediates without affecting the intact ketone. The net outcome of Route B is 4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\nTherefore, Route A yields 4-hydroxycyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and Route B yields the target 4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2195193"}]}
