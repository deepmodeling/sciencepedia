With four carbons total, the only partition of the carbon skeleton around the carbonyl is methyl plus ethyl, giving $CH_{3}COCH_{2}CH_{3}$, which is named butan-2-one.

This process, known as keto-enol tautomerism, is fundamental to their reactivity. This problem invites you to explore the factors that govern this equilibrium by predicting the most stable enol tautomer of an asymmetrical ketone, linking molecular structure directly to thermodynamic stability. [@problem_id:2203774]", "problem": "Consider the asymmetrical ketone, 2-methylcyclohexanone. This molecule consists of a six-membered carbon ring with a carbonyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2. Under conditions that favor thermodynamic equilibrium, such as the presence of a catalytic amount of acid or base, this ketone can equilibrate with its enol tautomers. Due to the asymmetry of the molecule, two distinct constitutional isomers of the enol can be formed by deprotonation at the different alpha-carbons.\n\nYour task is to determine the structure of the major enol product formed under these equilibrium conditions. Which of the following International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names correctly identifies the thermodynamically most stable enol tautomer of 2-methylcyclohexanone?\n\nA. 2-methylcyclohex-1-en-1-ol\n\nB. 6-methylcyclohex-1-en-1-ol\n\nC. 1-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol\n\nD. 2-methylenecyclohexan-1-ol", "solution": "Keto–enol tautomerization of 2-methylcyclohexanone proceeds by deprotonation at an alpha-carbon adjacent to the carbonyl ($\\alpha$ to $C=O$), followed by protonation on oxygen, giving an enol with a $C=C$ bond between the former carbonyl carbon and the deprotonated alpha-carbon, and an $OH$ on the former carbonyl carbon.\n\nFor 2-methylcyclohexanone, the two distinct alpha positions are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl: the substituted alpha-carbon (bearing the methyl group, conventionally labeled $C2$) and the unsubstituted alpha-carbon on the opposite side (conventionally labeled $C6$). Therefore, two constitutional enols are possible:\n- Deprotonation at $C2$ gives the enol with the double bond between $C1$ (the carbonyl carbon) and $C2$, retaining the methyl on the vinylic carbon; this corresponds to 2-methylcyclohex-1-en-1-ol (option A).\n- Deprotonation at $C6$ gives the enol with the double bond between $C1$ and $C6$; in the preferred IUPAC numbering for the enol, the methyl is then at position 6; this corresponds to 6-methylcyclohex-1-en-1-ol (option B).\n\nOptions C (1-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol) and D (2-methylenecyclohexan-1-ol) are not reachable by simple keto–enol tautomerization of 2-methylcyclohexanone: option C would require migration of the methyl group from $C2$ to $C1$, and option D would require formation of an exocyclic methylene at $C2$, neither of which occurs in simple enolization.\n\nUnder thermodynamic control, the more substituted alkene is more stable (Zaitsev-type preference), due to greater hyperconjugative stabilization. Comparing the two valid enols:\n- For the $C1=C2$ enol (option A), the alkene substitution count is three. Counting carbon substituents on the double-bond carbons: at $C1$ there is one carbon substituent (the ring carbon $C6$), and at $C2$ there are two carbon substituents (the ring carbon $C3$ and the methyl group). Thus the total number of carbon substituents is $1+2=3$ (trisubstituted alkene).\n- For the $C1=C6$ enol (option B), the alkene is disubstituted. At $C1$ there is one carbon substituent (the ring carbon $C2$), and at $C6$ there is one carbon substituent (the ring carbon $C5$), for a total $1+1=2$ (disubstituted alkene).\n\nSince a trisubstituted alkene is more stable than a disubstituted one under thermodynamic control, the major enol tautomer is the one with the $C1=C2$ double bond and the methyl on the vinylic carbon, i.e., 2-methylcyclohex-1-en-1-ol.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name for the thermodynamically most stable enol tautomer is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2203774"}, {"introduction": "Identifying an unknown compound is a central task for an organic chemist, and spectroscopy is the most powerful tool for this purpose.

This immediately accounts for the one degree of unsaturation as a carbonyl double bond in an aldehyde rather than a ring.\n\nThe integration ratio of the signal at $9.5$ ppm to the signal at $1.05$ ppm is $1:9$.

Nine equivalent protons appearing as a singlet near $1.0$ ppm strongly indicates a tert-butyl group, $(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{3}\\mathrm{C}-$. In such a group, the three methyl groups are equivalent and, because the attached carbon is quaternary (no hydrogens), there is no vicinal coupling to split them, so they appear as a singlet.\n\nThe aldehydic proton appearing as a singlet further implies that the carbon alpha to the formyl group has no hydrogens (otherwise the formyl proton typically shows small coupling to alpha hydrogens, giving a doublet, triplet, etc.). This is exactly the case for a tert-butyl aldehyde, where the formyl group is attached to a quaternary carbon.\n\nPutting these observations together, the structure consistent with the data is $(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{3}\\mathrm{CCHO}$, which has the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{5}\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{O}$ and the systematic IUPAC name $2,2$-dimethylpropanal.\n\nEliminating the other options:\n- Pentanal would show multiple aliphatic signals and the aldehyde proton would be split by two alpha hydrogens (typically a triplet), not a singlet.\n- 2-Methylbutanal and 3-Methylbutanal would each have several distinct aliphatic signals and the aldehyde proton would be split by at least one alpha hydrogen (doublet or more), not a singlet.\n- Ketones (Pentan-2-one, Pentan-3-one) have no aldehydic proton and would not show a signal at $\\delta\\approx 9.5$ ppm.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is $2,2$-dimethylpropanal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2203801"}]}
