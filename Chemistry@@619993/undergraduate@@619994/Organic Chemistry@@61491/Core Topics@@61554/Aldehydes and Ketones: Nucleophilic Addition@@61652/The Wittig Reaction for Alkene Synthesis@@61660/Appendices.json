This elegant technique provides definitive evidence for a proposed reaction mechanism. In this exercise, you will analyze a Wittig reaction where the carbonyl oxygen is labeled with a heavy isotope, $^{18}O$, allowing you to deduce the fate of this specific atom and confirm the formation of the highly stable triphenylphosphine oxide byproduct, which is a key thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. [@problem_id:2214015]", "problem": "An organic chemist performs a Wittig reaction using a specially prepared starting material. The carbonyl compound, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, has been isotopically labeled such that its carbonyl oxygen atom is oxygen-18 ($^{18}$O).

The $^{18}$O label is incorporated exclusively into the alkene product.\nB. The $^{18}$O label is incorporated exclusively into the triphenylphosphine oxide byproduct.\nC. The $^{18}$O label is equally distributed between the alkene product and the triphenylphosphine oxide byproduct.\nD. The $^{18}$O label is lost during the reaction, likely as H$_2^{18}$O, and does not appear in either of the two major products.\nE. The isotopic label on the carbonyl oxygen inhibits the reaction, preventing the formation of either major product.", "solution": "The Wittig reaction proceeds via the following established sequence: nucleophilic addition of the phosphonium ylide carbon to the carbonyl carbon generates a betaine in which the original carbonyl oxygen (bearing the $^{18}$O label) becomes an alkoxide and is associated with the phosphonium center. This betaine undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form an oxaphosphetane, a four-membered ring containing phosphorus and the labeled oxygen. The key fragmentation of the oxaphosphetane is a concerted cleavage that yields the alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. In this step, the oxygen atom that originated from the carbonyl becomes the oxygen of the P=O bond in triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nAtom economy and mapping confirm this: the starting material has one oxygen atom (the labeled $^{18}$O), and among the two major products, only triphenylphosphine oxide contains oxygen, while the alkene product contains none. Therefore the single oxygen atom must appear exclusively in triphenylphosphine oxide.

Isotopic substitution with $^{18}$O does not inhibit the reaction and does not introduce a mechanism that would distribute the label elsewhere or cause its loss.\n\nThus, based on the Wittig mechanism and isotopic labeling studies, the $^{18}$O label is incorporated exclusively into triphenylphosphine oxide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2214015"}, {"introduction": "Many organic molecules of interest contain multiple functional groups, presenting a significant challenge in synthesis: how to modify one part of the molecule while leaving others untouched.
