A “symmetrical secondary alcohol” is one where the hydroxyl-bearing carbon is bonded to two identical alkyl groups.\n\nThe product 3-pentanone is the symmetrical ketone commonly called diethyl ketone, which has a carbonyl carbon bonded to two ethyl groups. The corresponding secondary alcohol precursor that would oxidize to this ketone is the alcohol in which the hydroxyl-bearing carbon is attached to two ethyl groups, namely 3-pentanol (diethyl carbinol). Oxidation of 3-pentanol with PCC yields 3-pentanone.\n\nVerification against the options:\n- A. 3-pentanol: secondary, symmetrical (two ethyl groups), oxidizes to 3-pentanone.\n- B. 2-pentanol: secondary but unsymmetrical (methyl and propyl), would give 2-pentanone, not 3-pentanone.\n- C. 1-pentanol: primary, would give pentanal with PCC, not a ketone.\n- D. 2-methyl-2-butanol: tertiary, not oxidized by PCC to a ketone.\n- E. Cyclopentanol: secondary and symmetrical in a ring, but oxidation gives cyclopentanone, not 3-pentanone.\n- F. 3-pentanone: this is the product, not the starting alcohol.\n\nTherefore, the only starting alcohol consistent with a symmetrical secondary alcohol that yields 3-pentanone with PCC is 3-pentanol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2191033"}, {"introduction": "Beyond alcohol oxidation, another powerful tool for carbonyl synthesis is the cleavage of carbon-carbon double bonds through ozonolysis. This exercise challenges you to think like a synthetic chemist, working backward from a desired aldehyde to identify the specific alkene starting material [@problem_id:2191066]. Success requires a clear grasp of how an alkene's structure is precisely mapped onto its ozonolysis products.", "problem": "An organic chemist is planning a synthesis that requires the preparation of propanal ($CH_3CH_2CHO$) as the sole organic product from an ozonolysis reaction. The procedure involves treating an alkene with ozone ($O_3$) as the first step, followed by a workup with dimethyl sulfide ($(CH_3)_2S$).

But-2-ene", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify an alkene that yields only propanal upon ozonolysis with a reductive workup.\n\nThe reaction described is the ozonolysis of an alkene. This reaction involves two steps:\n1.  Reaction with ozone ($O_3$), which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond ($C=C$) to form an ozonide intermediate.\n2.  A workup step. In this case, dimethyl sulfide ($(CH_3)_2S$) is used, which is a reductive workup. A reductive workup converts the ozonide into aldehydes and/or ketones. Specifically, each carbon atom of the original double bond becomes the carbon atom of a carbonyl group ($C=O$). If a carbon atom of the double bond is bonded to at least one hydrogen, it becomes an aldehyde. If it is bonded to two carbon atoms, it becomes a ketone.\n\nThe desired product is propanal ($CH_3CH_2CHO$), which is a three-carbon aldehyde. The problem states that this is the *sole* organic product. For ozonolysis to produce a single organic product, the starting alkene must be symmetrical with respect to its double bond.\n\nLet's work backward from the product. The product is propanal:\n$$CH_3-CH_2-CH=O$$\nThe carbonyl carbon was one of the carbons in the original alkene's double bond. This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom and an ethyl group ($-CH_2CH_3$). Therefore, the \"half\" of the alkene that forms this product must have the structure $...=CH-CH_2CH_3$.\n\nSince the starting alkene is symmetrical, both halves must be identical. We can construct the alkene by joining two of these fragments at the double bond:\n$$CH_3CH_2-CH=CH-CH_2CH_3$$\nThis molecule has a six-carbon chain with the double bond starting at the third carbon. Its IUPAC name is hex-3-ene.\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the given options to confirm our reasoning.\n\nA. **Hex-3-ene ($CH_3CH_2CH=CHCH_2CH_3$)**: This is a symmetrical alkene.

(CH_3)_2S} 2 \\times CH_3CH_2CHO$$\nThis reaction produces two molecules of propanal. Thus, propanal is the sole organic product. This is the correct starting material.\n\nB. **Hex-1-ene ($CH_2=CHCH_2CH_2CH_2CH_3$)**: This is an unsymmetrical alkene. Cleavage of the double bond between C1 and C2 will produce two different products.\n$$CH_2=CHCH_2CH_2CH_2CH_3 \\xrightarrow{1. O_3} \\xrightarrow{2. (CH_3)_2S} HCHO + OHCCH_2CH_2CH_2CH_3$$\nThe products are methanal (formaldehyde) and pentanal. This is incorrect.\n\nC. **Cyclohexene**: This is a cyclic, symmetrical alkene. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond and opens the ring.\n$$ \\text{Cyclohexene} \\xrightarrow{1. O_3} \\xrightarrow{2. (CH_3)_2S} OHC-CH_2CH_2CH_2CH_2-CHO$$\nThe product is a single molecule, hexanedial. This is not propanal. This is incorrect.\n\nD. **2,3-Dimethylbut-2-ene ($(CH_3)_2C=C(CH_3)_2$)**: This is a symmetrical alkene. Each carbon in the double bond is attached to two other carbon atoms (methyl groups).\n$$(CH_3)_2C=C(CH_3)_2 \\xrightarrow{1. O_3} \\xrightarrow{2. (CH_3)_2S} 2 \\times (CH_3)_2C=O$$\nThis reaction produces two molecules of propan-2-one (acetone), which is a ketone, not the desired aldehyde, propanal.

The key chemoselectivity requirement is to avoid conditions that would open the epoxide. Epoxides undergo ring opening by nucleophiles under basic conditions and by weak nucleophiles after protonation under acidic conditions. Therefore, reagents that are strongly acidic, strongly basic, or aqueous (providing nucleophiles) risk epoxide opening. Mild, neutral, anhydrous oxidation conditions are preferred.\n\nEvaluate each option against these constraints and the desired oxidation:\n\n- Option A (Jones Reagent, $\\text{H}_{2}\\text{CrO}_{4}$ from $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{Cr}_{2}\\text{O}_{7}/\\text{H}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}$ in acetone): This reagent is strongly acidic and aqueous. Under such conditions, the epoxide will be protonated and susceptible to nucleophilic ring opening by water or other nucleophiles, leading to diols or rearranged products. Although secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones by Jones reagent, the epoxide would not be preserved with high selectivity.\n\n- Option B ($\\text{KMnO}_{4}$ in cold aqueous $\\text{NaOH}$): Strong oxidant in basic, aqueous medium. Hydroxide will open the epoxide under basic conditions by nucleophilic attack at the less substituted carbon. Additionally, $\\text{KMnO}_{4}$ can over-oxidize or effect oxidative ring opening in related systems. This is not compatible with preserving the epoxide.\n\n- Option C (Dess-Martin periodinane, DMP, in $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{Cl}_{2}$): DMP is a mild, neutral, anhydrous oxidant that cleanly converts secondary alcohols to ketones, typically represented as\n$$\nR_{2}\\text{CHOH} \\xrightarrow[\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{Cl}_{2}]{\\text{DMP}} R_{2}\\text{C}{=}\\text{O}.\n$$\nBecause the conditions are non-aqueous and not strongly acidic or basic, the epoxide is not activated toward ring opening and is preserved. This reagent is well known for functional group tolerance and high yields in such transformations.\n\n- Option D ($\\text{NaBH}_{4}$ in ethanol): This is a reducing agent that converts ketones and aldehydes to alcohols; it does not oxidize alcohols. It is the opposite of what is required.\n\n- Option E (Ozone with dimethyl sulfide workup): Ozonolysis targets carbon-carbon double bonds; it does not oxidize alcohols to ketones under standard conditions. There is no alkene to be cleaved, and ozone does not provide the desired transformation.\n\nConclusion: The only reagent set that accomplishes selective oxidation of the secondary alcohol to the ketone under conditions that preserve the epoxide with high yield is Dess-Martin periodinane in dichloromethane.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2191012"}]}
