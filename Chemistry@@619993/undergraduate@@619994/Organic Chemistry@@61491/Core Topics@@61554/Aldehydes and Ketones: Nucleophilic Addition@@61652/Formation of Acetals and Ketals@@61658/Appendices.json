Step 3: Aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).", "solution": "The goal is to selectively reduce the ester group of methyl 4-formylbenzoate to a primary alcohol, while leaving the aldehyde group intact.\n\nThe starting material is:\nMethyl 4-formylbenzoate, which has an aldehyde group ($-CHO$) and a methyl ester group ($-COOCH_3$).\n\nThe target product is:\n4-(hydroxymethyl)benzaldehyde, which has an aldehyde group ($-CHO$) and a primary alcohol group ($-CH_2OH$).\n\nLet's analyze the reactivity of the functional groups. Aldehydes are generally more reactive towards nucleophilic reagents, including hydride reducing agents, than esters. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both aldehydes and esters. Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a milder reducing agent that can reduce aldehydes and ketones but is generally not reactive enough to reduce esters.\n\nWe must use a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ to convert the ester to a primary alcohol. However, if used directly, LiAlH₄ would preferentially reduce the more reactive aldehyde. Therefore, the aldehyde group must be temporarily \"protected\" by converting it into a less reactive functional group that is stable under the reduction conditions.\n\nThe standard strategy is as follows:\n1.  **Protection:** Convert the aldehyde into an acetal. Acetals are stable to strong bases and nucleophiles like LiAlH₄. Aldehydes react much more readily than esters with alcohols under acidic conditions to form acetals. Using a diol like ethylene glycol results in a stable cyclic acetal.\n2.  **Reduction:** With the aldehyde group protected, the ester can be reduced using LiAlH₄.\n3.  **Deprotection:** The acetal protecting group is removed by hydrolysis with aqueous acid to regenerate the aldehyde.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on this strategy:\n\n**Option A:** 1. LiAlH₄ in diethyl ether; 2. H₃O⁺ workup.\nThis sequence applies a strong reducing agent directly to the starting material. Since LiAlH₄ reduces both aldehydes and esters, this would result in the reduction of both functional groups, yielding 1,4-benzenedimethanol. This is not the desired product.\n\n**Option B:** 1. NaBH₄ in methanol; 2. H₃O⁺ workup.\nThis sequence uses a mild reducing agent, NaBH₄. It will selectively reduce the aldehyde to an alcohol, but it is not strong enough to reduce the ester. The product would be methyl 4-(hydroxymethyl)benzoate. This is not the desired product.\n\n**Option C:** 1. Ethylene glycol, catalytic TsOH; 2. LiAlH₄ in diethyl ether, followed by a separate aqueous workup.\nStep 1 correctly protects the aldehyde as a cyclic acetal. Step 2 correctly reduces the ester to a primary alcohol. However, this sequence omits the final deprotection step required to convert the acetal back into the aldehyde. The final product would have a protected aldehyde group, not the aldehyde itself.\n\n**Option D:** 1. Ethylene glycol, catalytic TsOH; 2. LiAlH₄ in diethyl ether; 3. Aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).\nStep 1 correctly protects the aldehyde as a cyclic acetal. Step 2 uses LiAlH₄ to reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol (initially an alkoxide). Step 3, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), accomplishes two essential tasks: it quenches the reaction and protonates the alkoxide formed in the reduction step, and it hydrolyzes the acetal protecting group, regenerating the aldehyde. This three-step sequence successfully yields the target product, 4-(hydroxymethyl)benzaldehyde.\n\n**Option E:** 1. LiAlH₄ in diethyl ether; 2. Ethylene glycol, catalytic TsOH; 3. H₃O⁺ workup.\nThis sequence performs the steps in the wrong order. The first step is an unselective reduction that would yield 1,4-benzenedimethanol, as explained for Option A. Subsequent steps are irrelevant as the initial step already leads to the wrong product.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reagents is described in Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2171359"}, {"introduction": "After designing a synthetic pathway, how does a chemist confirm that a planned reaction has actually occurred in the laboratory? This exercise [@problem_id:2171389] explores the practical use of Infrared (IR) spectroscopy to monitor the conversion of a ketone into a ketal.

The starting material is butanone, which is treated with one equivalent of ethylene glycol and a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid to facilitate the reaction. The progress of the reaction is monitored using Infrared (IR) spectroscopy.\n\nAssuming the reaction proceeds to completion and the product is purified, which of the following statements best describes the expected change in the 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ region of the IR spectrum when comparing the spectrum of the starting material (butanone) to that of the final product (2-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane)?\n\nA.

No significant change is observed in this region as both reactant and product have similar absorptions here.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the change in the Infrared (IR) spectrum, specifically in the 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ region, when butanone is converted into its cyclic ethylene glycol ketal.\n\nStep 1: Identify the key functional group in the starting material, butanone.\nButanone is a ketone. The characteristic functional group of a ketone is the carbonyl group, which consists of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (C=O).\n\nStep 2: Recall the characteristic IR absorption of a carbonyl group.\nThe stretching vibration of the C=O double bond in an aliphatic ketone like butanone gives rise to a very strong and sharp absorption peak in the IR spectrum. The typical frequency for this absorption is in the range of 1705-1725 cm⁻¹. This falls squarely within the 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ region mentioned in the problem. Therefore, the spectrum of the starting material, butanone, will show a prominent peak in this region.\n\nStep 3: Identify the key functional group in the product.\nThe reaction of a ketone (butanone) with a diol (ethylene glycol) in the presence of an acid catalyst forms a cyclic ketal. The product in this case is 2-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane. In this reaction, the C=O double bond is broken. The carbonyl carbon, which was sp²-hybridized, becomes sp³-hybridized and forms two new single bonds to the oxygen atoms of the ethylene glycol molecule. The final product, the ketal, does not contain a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nStep 4: Determine the IR absorption of the product's functional group.\nThe ketal functional group contains C-O single bonds. The stretching vibrations for C-O single bonds typically appear in the fingerprint region of the IR spectrum, at lower frequencies, usually between 1000 cm⁻¹ and 1300 cm⁻¹. These absorptions are outside the 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ region.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the overall change in the specified region.\nSince the starting material (butanone) has a strong C=O absorption peak in the 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ region and the product (the ketal) has no functional group that absorbs in this region, the successful conversion of the reactant to the product will result in the complete disappearance of this characteristic peak. This change is, in fact, how chemists often confirm the success of such a protection reaction.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options.\nA. A new, strong absorption peak appears within the 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ region. This is incorrect. No new carbonyl group is formed.\nB. A strong absorption peak that was present in the starting material's spectrum is absent in the product's spectrum. This is correct, as the C=O group has been removed.\nC. A strong peak in this region shifts to a significantly higher frequency (above 1750 cm⁻¹). This is incorrect. The peak does not shift; it disappears.\nD. A strong peak in this region shifts to a significantly lower frequency (below 1700 cm⁻¹). This is incorrect. The peak disappears.\nE. No significant change is observed. This is incorrect, as a major functional group transformation has occurred, leading to a very significant spectral change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2171389"}, {"introduction": "A reaction's success is governed not only by electronic factors but also by the three-dimensional architecture of the reactants. This final practice [@problem_id:2171393] presents a compelling case study on steric hindrance, comparing the ease of ketal formation for a simple ketone versus a complex, rigid bicyclic one. Analyzing the structural environment around the carbonyl group will help you develop a deeper appreciation for how steric bulk can obstruct a nucleophile's approach, thus dictating the kinetic feasibility of a reaction.", "problem": "In synthetic organic chemistry, carbonyl groups are often \"protected\" to prevent them from reacting while other parts of a molecule are being modified. A common method for protecting a ketone is to convert it into a cyclic ketal by reacting it with ethylene glycol in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH).\n\nConsider two ketones: cyclohexanone and camphor. Camphor is a naturally occurring bicyclic ketone with the systematic IUPAC name (1R,4R)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one. Its structure features a six-membered ring bridged by a carbon atom (C7) which bears two methyl groups. The carbonyl group is at the C2 position.\n\nWhen cyclohexanone and camphor are subjected to identical reaction conditions with ethylene glycol and a catalytic amount of p-TsOH, it is observed that cyclohexanone is readily converted to its corresponding spirocyclic ketal in high yield. In contrast, camphor reacts extremely slowly, and the formation of its ketal is negligible under these standard conditions.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and significant reason for this pronounced difference in reactivity?\n\nA. Steric hindrance from the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework, particularly from the methyl groups on the C7 bridge, obstructs the trajectory of the incoming ethylene glycol nucleophile towards the carbonyl carbon.\n\nB. The carbonyl group in camphor is significantly less electrophilic than in cyclohexanone due to hyperconjugation with the adjacent C-C bonds in the strained bicyclic system, which delocalizes the partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon.\n\nC. The planar five-membered dioxolane ring required for the ketal product introduces excessive angle strain into the rigid bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton, making the final ketal product thermodynamically unstable compared to the starting ketone.\n\nD. The intramolecular ring-closing step to form the five-membered ketal ring from the hemiacetal intermediate is sterically prohibited in the rigid camphor framework, even if the initial nucleophilic attack occurs.", "solution": "Under acid-catalyzed acetal (ketal) formation, the generally accepted mechanism comprises:\n(1) reversible carbonyl protonation to give a more electrophilic oxonium,\n(2) nucleophilic attack by alcohol to form a hemiacetal,\n(3) proton transfers leading to loss of water and an oxocarbenium,\n(4) nucleophilic attack by the second alcohol oxygen (intramolecular in the case of ethylene glycol) to close the ring, followed by deprotonation to the acetal.\n\nFor a hindered ketone, the slow and rate-determining event is typically the nucleophilic addition of alcohol to the protonated carbonyl. Symbolically, if $\\text{C=O}$ denotes the carbonyl and $\\text{ROH}$ denotes alcohol, the rate-limiting step is well approximated as\n$$\n\\text{rate} \\approx k\\,[\\text{C=OH}^{+}][\\text{ROH}],\n$$\nso any steric factor that impedes productive approach of $\\text{ROH}$ to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon suppresses the overall rate.\n\nComparative analysis:\n- Cyclohexanone presents a relatively unhindered, conformationally flexible six-membered ring. Its planar carbonyl is accessible from both faces, so after protonation, ethylene glycol can approach with a favorable Bürgi–Dunitz trajectory to form the hemiacetal efficiently. Subsequent intramolecular closure to a five-membered dioxolane (spiroketal) is entropically favorable and conformationally facile in this flexible framework, giving high yields under standard conditions.\n- Camphor, (1R,4R)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, bears a rigid bicyclic scaffold with a gem-dimethyl-substituted bridge at C7 that caps one face (endo face) of the carbonyl. The other face (exo) is still sterically encumbered due to the compact, concave environment imposed by the bicyclic framework. Under acid catalysis, ethylene glycol is a relatively weak nucleophile; hence, steric congestion that disrupts the optimal approach angle to the protonated carbonyl dramatically reduces the rate of the first addition to the carbonyl (hemiacetal formation). This is the dominant kinetic penalty in camphor and explains why ketalization is negligible under conditions that readily convert cyclohexanone.\n\nAssessment of the options in light of mechanism and structure:\n- Option A correctly identifies the principal factor: severe steric hindrance around the camphor carbonyl, especially from the C7 gem-dimethyl and the rigid bicyclic framework, obstructs the nucleophile’s trajectory to the carbonyl carbon. This directly suppresses the rate-limiting nucleophilic addition step.\n- Option B is not accurate: invoking reduced electrophilicity due to hyperconjugation in this strained system is not the primary influence; if anything, ring strain and limited conjugation do not significantly delocalize the positive charge on the protonated carbonyl to make it markedly less electrophilic than cyclohexanone. The overwhelming experimental signature is steric, not electronic deactivation.\n- Option C is incorrect: five-membered dioxolanes are not required to be planar; they adopt low-strain envelope/twist conformations. There is no compelling thermodynamic argument that the dioxolane ketal would be destabilized uniquely within camphor relative to cyclohexanone sufficient to explain the kinetic inertness.\n- Option D overemphasizes the ring-closing step. Once a hemiacetal is formed and an oxocarbenium is generated, intramolecular capture by the tethered second hydroxyl is typically rapid. The kinetic bottleneck for camphor under these conditions is the initial nucleophilic addition to the protonated carbonyl, not a prohibitive intramolecular closure.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and significant reason for the observed reactivity difference is the steric obstruction of nucleophilic approach to the camphor carbonyl, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2171393"}]}
