Hexane", "solution": "We identify the functional group and the reagent’s selectivity. Hexanal is an aldehyde with a six-carbon chain and a terminal carbonyl group. Sodium borohydride is a selective hydride donor that reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols under mild conditions; in methanol, the solvent serves as the proton source to quench the alkoxide intermediate. Under these conditions, sodium borohydride does not reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols, does not alter the carbon skeleton, and does not fully deoxygenate to an alkane.\n\nThe general reduction of an aldehyde by sodium borohydride in an alcohol solvent proceeds via hydride transfer to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, forming an alkoxide, followed by protonation by the solvent:\n$$\n\\text{R-CHO} + \\text{NaBH}_{4} \\xrightarrow{\\text{MeOH}} \\text{R-CH}_{2}\\text{O}^{-} \\xrightarrow{\\text{MeOH}} \\text{R-CH}_{2}\\text{OH}\n$$\nApplying this to hexanal ($\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{(CH}_{2}\\text{)}_{4}\\text{CHO}$), the carbonyl at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol without rearrangement or chain shortening/lengthening, giving hexan-1-ol.\n\nWe exclude the other options based on reactivity:\n- Hexan-2-ol would require reduction of a ketone or rearrangement, which does not occur here.\n- Hexanoic acid is the oxidation product of hexanal, not the reduction product.\n- 2-Methylpentan-1-ol would require carbon skeleton rearrangement, which does not occur with sodium borohydride.\n- Hexane would require deoxygenation, which sodium borohydride does not effect under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the major product is hexan-1-ol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2206768"}, {"introduction": "In practical organic chemistry, synthesis and analysis are inseparable. This problem simulates a real-world scenario where you must deduce the identity of an unknown compound by combining information from a chemical reaction and its spectroscopic data. By interpreting the simple $^{1}$H NMR spectrum of an alcohol produced via oxymercuration-demercuration, you will piece together the structural puzzle and identify both the product and the starting alkene.

The alkene is first treated with mercury(II) acetate, $Hg(OAc)_2$, in water, followed by a reduction step with sodium borohydride, $NaBH_4$. The resulting alcohol product is isolated and analyzed. Its proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{1}$H NMR) spectrum displays a remarkably simple pattern, consisting of only three distinct signals: a singlet, a quartet, and a triplet.\n\nBased on this information, identify the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names for both the starting alkene and the final alcohol product from the options below.\n\nA.

Alkene: 2-ethyl-1-pentene, Alcohol: 2-ethyl-1-pentanol\n\nE. Alkene: hept-1-ene, Alcohol: heptan-2-ol", "solution": "We are told the alkene has formula $C_{7}H_{14}$ and undergoes oxymercuration-demercuration (treatment with $Hg(OAc)_{2}$ in water, followed by $NaBH_{4}$), which gives Markovnikov hydration across the double bond without carbocation rearrangement. Thus, the hydroxyl group installs at the more substituted alkene carbon, yielding the corresponding Markovnikov alcohol.\n\nThe $^{1}$H NMR of the alcohol shows only three signals: a singlet, a quartet, and a triplet. Interpreting the splitting via the $n+1$ rule:\n- A quartet and a triplet together strongly indicate an ethyl fragment, where the methylene adjacent to a methyl appears as a quartet (coupled to $n=3$ protons) and the methyl appears as a triplet (coupled to $n=2$ protons).\n- The singlet is consistent with an exchangeable $OH$ proton that typically does not show vicinal coupling in protic solvents.\n\nFor the alcohol to display only these three signals, the carbon framework must make all ethyl groups equivalent and avoid additional distinct proton environments. This occurs in a highly symmetric tertiary alcohol in which the carbon bearing the $OH$ is bonded to three identical ethyl groups. That structure is 3-ethyl-3-pentanol (triethylcarbinol). In this molecule:\n- All three $CH_{2}$ groups directly attached to the tertiary carbon are equivalent, giving one signal (quartet by coupling to the adjacent methyls).\n- All three terminal $CH_{3}$ groups are equivalent, giving one signal (triplet by coupling to the adjacent methylenes).\n- The $OH$ appears as a singlet.\nHence exactly three signals: singlet, quartet, triplet.\n\nTherefore, the alcohol must be 3-ethyl-3-pentanol. By Markovnikov addition without rearrangement, the corresponding alkene precursor is the one that places the $OH$ at the more substituted alkene carbon to yield that tertiary center: 3-ethyl-2-pentene. Checking the options:\n\n- A: Alkene 3-ethyl-2-pentene gives Alcohol 3-ethyl-3-pentanol under Markovnikov hydration; the product has the required simple NMR (singlet, quartet, triplet).\n- B: 2,3-dimethyl-2-pentanol would not have only three signals; multiple inequivalent methyl and methine/methylene environments would be present.\n- C: Places $OH$ at C2 (anti-Markovnikov relative to the more substituted carbon in 3-ethyl-2-pentene), inconsistent with oxymercuration.\n- D: Predicts 2-ethyl-1-pentanol from 2-ethyl-1-pentene, which is not the Markovnikov product.\n- E: Heptan-2-ol would exhibit many more than three distinct proton signals.\n\nThus the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2206800"}]}
