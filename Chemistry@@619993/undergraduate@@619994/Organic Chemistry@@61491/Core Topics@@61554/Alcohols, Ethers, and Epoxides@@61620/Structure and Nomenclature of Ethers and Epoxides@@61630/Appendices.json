{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of organic chemistry is understanding isomerism—the phenomenon where different compounds share the same molecular formula. This practice focuses on constitutional isomerism, which deals with variations in atomic connectivity. By systematically exploring the possible structures for an ether with the formula $C_4H_{10}O$, you will develop a fundamental skill for identifying and differentiating compounds based on their skeletal framework [@problem_id:2205264].", "problem": "A chemical analysis of a solvent mixture reveals the presence of several organic compounds, all of which share the molecular formula $C_4H_{10}O$. Further spectroscopic investigation confirms that all compounds in the mixture belong to the ether functional group family. Determine the total number of distinct constitutional isomers possible for an ether with this molecular formula.\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 5\n\nE. 6", "solution": "We are told all compounds are ethers with molecular formula $C_{4}H_{10}O$. An ether has the connectivity $R-O-R^{\\prime}$, where $R$ and $R^{\\prime}$ are alkyl groups. The degree of unsaturation is zero because for $n=4$, a saturated acyclic structure with one oxygen has $H=2n+2=10$, matching $C_{4}H_{10}O$. Therefore, cyclic ethers (which would have $C_{n}H_{2n}O$) are excluded, and only acyclic ethers need to be considered.\n\nLet $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ be the numbers of carbons in $R$ and $R^{\\prime}$, respectively. For an ether, we require\n$$\nn_{1}+n_{2}=4,\\quad n_{1}\\ge 1,\\quad n_{2}\\ge 1.\n$$\nThe possible carbon partitions are $(n_{1},n_{2})=(1,3)$ and $(2,2)$.\n\nFor $(2,2)$: both substituents are ethyl groups. There is only one constitutional isomer, diethyl ether, with connectivity $CH_{3}CH_{2}-O-CH_{2}CH_{3}$.\n\nFor $(1,3)$: one substituent is methyl and the other is propyl. The propyl group has two constitutional isomers: $n$-propyl and isopropyl. Thus there are two distinct ethers:\n- Methyl $n$-propyl ether: $CH_{3}-O-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{3}$.\n- Methyl isopropyl ether: $CH_{3}-O-CH(CH_{3})_{2}$.\n\nNo other partitions exist, and alcohols (which would correspond to $(4,0)$) are excluded by the requirement that the functional group is an ether. There are no additional constitutional isomers within these categories because ethyl has no isomers for two carbons, and the two propyl connectivities have already been counted. Therefore, the total number of distinct ether constitutional isomers with formula $C_{4}H_{10}O$ is\n$$\n1+2=3.\n$$\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2205264"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple connectivity, we enter the three-dimensional world of stereochemistry. This exercise introduces epoxides, a vital class of cyclic ethers, and uses *cis*-2,3-diethyloxirane as a model to explore symmetry. You will investigate how a molecule can possess stereocenters (chiral centers) yet be achiral overall, a concept known as a meso compound, due to the presence of an internal plane of symmetry [@problem_id:2205243].", "problem": "Analyze the stereochemistry of the molecule named *cis*-2,3-diethyloxirane. Based on its structure, determine which of the following statements is correct.\n\nA. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n\nB. The molecule is achiral because it does not possess any stereocenters.\n\nC. The molecule is an achiral meso compound.\n\nD. The molecule is achiral due to rapid conformational inversion at room temperature.\n\nE. The molecule is chiral, but it is a diastereomer of *trans*-2,3-diethyloxirane.", "solution": "Identify the stereocenters: In 2,3-diethyloxirane, the ring carbons $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ each bear four different substituents: $H$, $C_{2}H_{5}$, $O$, and the other ring carbon. Therefore, both $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ are stereogenic centers, so the molecule has stereocenters.\n\nAnalyze the relative configuration: The descriptor cis means the two ethyl groups on $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ lie on the same face of the three-membered ring. With identical substituents on adjacent stereocenters in a three-membered ring, the cis arrangement often introduces an internal symmetry element.\n\nTest for an internal mirror plane: In cis-2,3-diethyloxirane, there is a mirror plane that passes through the oxygen atom and bisects the $C_{2}-C_{3}$ bond, reflecting $C_{2}$ onto $C_{3}$. Because the substituents at $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ are identical ($C_{2}H_{5}$ and $H$) and both ethyl groups are on the same face, this reflection maps each substituent set onto the other. Consequently, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nConclude chirality: The presence of this internal mirror plane makes the cis isomer achiral despite having two stereocenters. This is the definition of a meso compound: it contains stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal symmetry element.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is incorrect: cis-2,3-diethyloxirane is not a pair of enantiomers; it is a single achiral meso compound.\n- B is incorrect: there are stereocenters at $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$.\n- C is correct: it is an achiral meso compound.\n- D is incorrect: achirality does not arise from conformational inversion in this rigid three-membered ring.\n- E is incorrect: although cis and trans are diastereomers, the cis isomer is not chiral.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that cis-2,3-diethyloxirane is an achiral meso compound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2205243"}, {"introduction": "Having explored an achiral meso compound, we now turn our attention to its chiral counterpart. This practice challenges you to analyze the stereochemistry of *trans*-1,2-dimethoxycyclopentane, a substituted cyclic ether. Unlike the *cis* isomer which can be meso, the *trans* arrangement often breaks the internal symmetry, leading to a chiral molecule that exists as a pair of enantiomers. This problem will sharpen your ability to predict chirality by assessing symmetry elements in more complex, flexible ring systems [@problem_id:2205249].", "problem": "Consider the molecule named trans-1,2-dimethoxycyclopentane.

Which of the following statements accurately describes this molecule?\n\nA. The molecule is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n\nB. The molecule is achiral because it is a meso compound.\n\nC. The molecule is chiral and exists as a single enantiomer.\n\nD. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n\nE. The molecule is achiral due to rapid ring flipping which averages out the stereochemistry.", "solution": "Interpret the name: trans-1,2-dimethoxycyclopentane denotes a cyclopentane ring with methoxy groups at C1 and C2 on opposite faces of the ring (one above, one below).\n\nIdentify stereocenters: C1 and C2 are each bonded to four different substituents (OMe, H, and two non-equivalent ring paths), so both are stereogenic centers.\n\nAssess possible symmetry:\n- For identical substituents at adjacent stereocenters, a meso form would require an internal symmetry element (typically a mirror plane) that interconverts the two centers while inverting their configurations (i.e., an $R,S$ arrangement with a plane of symmetry).\n- In a five-membered ring, there is no $C_{2}$ axis that swaps C1 and C2, and with the trans arrangement (one substituent up and the other down), any potential mirror plane is destroyed because a plane that swaps C1 and C2 would also need to map an “up” substituent to “up,” which is incompatible with trans (one is “up,” the other “down”). Consequently, there is no plane or center of symmetry for the trans-1,2 isomer.\n\nRelate relative and absolute configurations:\n- For 1,2-disubstitution with identical groups, the trans arrangement corresponds to like absolute configurations at the two centers ($R,R$ and $S,S$), which are non-superimposable mirror images. Hence the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n- The meso possibility ($R,S$ with an internal mirror plane) arises for the cis-1,2 isomer, not the trans isomer.\n\nConsider conformational effects:\n- Cyclopentane undergoes rapid pseudorotation, but conformational changes do not invert the $R/S$ configuration at a tetrahedral stereocenter; they only change conformations. Therefore, rapid ring flipping does not render the molecule achiral nor average out its configurational chirality.\n\nConclusion: The correct description is that the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2205249"}]}
