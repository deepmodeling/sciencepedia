No reaction occurs", "solution": "2-Methyloxirane (propylene oxide) is an unsymmetrical epoxide containing one primary epoxide carbon, denoted $C_1$, and one secondary epoxide carbon, denoted $C_2$, which bears a methyl substituent. Under basic or neutral conditions, nucleophilic ring opening of epoxides proceeds by an $S_N2$-type mechanism, where the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon (here, $C_1$) with concomitant ring opening. Ammonia, $NH_3$, is a neutral nucleophile under these conditions.\n\nApplying this principle, $NH_3$ attacks $C_1$ (the less substituted, primary epoxide carbon), resulting in ring opening and formation of an alkoxide at $C_2$ and an ammonium at the newly formed carbon–nitrogen bond:\n$$\n\\text{epoxide} + NH_{3} \\rightarrow \\text{alkoxide–ammonium intermediate}\n$$\nMore explicitly, the intermediate has the connectivity $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}(\\text{O}^-)\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-NH}_3^+$, where the oxygen resides on the secondary carbon ($C_2$) as $O^{-}$ and the nitrogen is attached to the primary carbon ($C_1$) as $\\text{NH}_3^+$.\n\nA rapid proton transfer then occurs.

Protonation by HBr generates a positively charged, activated epoxide and liberates bromide as the nucleophile.\n\nIn acid-catalyzed epoxide openings, nucleophilic attack occurs at the more substituted carbon of the protonated epoxide because the transition state has substantial carbocation character at that position; thus, the more substituted (and more stabilized) site is favored. For 2-methyl-2-phenyloxirane, the epoxide carbon bearing both a phenyl and a methyl group is the more substituted and is additionally benzylic; this site best stabilizes positive charge through resonance with the aromatic ring and hyperconjugation.\n\nTherefore, $Br^-$ attacks the benzylic, more substituted epoxide carbon from the backside (anti to the leaving oxygen), opening the ring. The oxygen remains attached to the less substituted carbon and, after deprotonation by solvent water, becomes an alcohol. The resulting product is a bromohydrin with bromine at the benzylic, tertiary center and hydroxyl at the primary carbon: $\\text{HO-CH}_2\\text{-C(Br)(CH}_3)(\\text{Ph})$.

The methanol nucleophile then attacks this electrophilic center. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by the relative stability of the two possible transition states.\n\nIn this particular substrate, two powerful electronic stabilization effects are in competition:\n1.  **Benzylic stabilization**: A positive charge on the carbon atom adjacent to the phenyl group is stabilized by resonance.\n2.  **The $\\beta$-silicon effect**: A positive charge on a carbon atom that is beta (two bonds away) to a silicon atom is strongly stabilized by hyperconjugation with the carbon-silicon $\\sigma$-bond.\n\nThe two possible regioisomeric products of the reaction are given below:\n- **Compound I**: 2-methoxy-1-phenyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)ethan-1-ol\n- **Compound II**: 1-methoxy-1-phenyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)ethan-2-ol\n\nBased on a comparison of the relative strengths of the benzylic and $\\beta$-silicon electronic effects, which statement below most accurately predicts the outcome of the reaction?\n\nA.

Empirically and mechanistically, this effect can surpass classical benzylic resonance stabilization in lowering $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for cationic processes.
