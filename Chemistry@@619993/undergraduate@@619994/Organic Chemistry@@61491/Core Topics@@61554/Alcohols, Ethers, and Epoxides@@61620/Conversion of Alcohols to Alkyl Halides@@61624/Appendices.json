We must analyze the outcome of treating it with two different reagents.\n\n**Reaction with HBr:** Hot, concentrated HBr promotes a substitution reaction via an Sₙ1 mechanism, which involves a carbocation intermediate.\n1.  **Protonation and Loss of Water:** The -OH group is protonated by HBr and leaves as water, generating a secondary carbocation at the C2 position: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH⁺-CH₃`.\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement:** This secondary carbocation can rearrange to form a more stable tertiary carbocation. A hydrogen atom with its bonding electrons (a hydride) shifts from the adjacent C3 to C2. This is called a 1,2-hydride shift.\n    ` (CH₃)₂CH-CH⁺-CH₃ ` (secondary carbocation) → ` (CH₃)₂C⁺-CH₂-CH₃ ` (tertiary carbocation)\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The bromide ion (Br⁻) attacks the more stable tertiary carbocation. This yields the rearranged product, 2-bromo-2-methylbutane.\n\n**Reaction with PBr₃:** Phosphorus tribromide converts alcohols to alkyl bromides via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n1.  **Activation:** The alcohol's oxygen attacks PBr₃, forming a good leaving group (a phosphite ester) at the C2 position.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** A bromide ion (Br⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, performing a backside attack on the C2 carbon and displacing the leaving group.\nThis Sₙ2 reaction occurs in a single concerted step and does not involve a carbocation intermediate. Therefore, no rearrangement of the carbon skeleton occurs. The bromide simply replaces the hydroxyl group at its original position. The product is the unrearranged secondary bromide, 2-bromo-3-methylbutane.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reaction with HBr gives the rearranged product 2-bromo-2-methylbutane, while the reaction with PBr₃ gives the unrearranged product 2-bromo-3-methylbutane.

The reaction conditions are phosphorus tribromide in the presence of pyridine. The relevant mechanistic principle is that alcohols treated with PBr₃ undergo conversion to alkyl bromides via an Sₙ2 displacement at the carbon bearing the leaving group, proceeding with backside attack and a single Walden inversion at that carbon. Formation of the phosphorus ester intermediate occurs at phosphorus and does not alter the configuration at carbon; the stereochemical change arises only in the subsequent Sₙ2 step at C2.\n\nStep-by-step:\n1. The alcohol oxygen of (2S, 3S)-3-methylpentan-2-ol attacks PBr₃ to form the corresponding dibromophosphite ester; pyridine acts as a base to neutralize acidic byproducts. This step does not change the configuration at C2 because no bond at the stereogenic carbon is broken or formed in a way that inverts its configuration.\n2. A bromide ion generated in situ performs an Sₙ2 backside attack on C2, displacing the phosphorus-containing leaving group. This Sₙ2 reaction leads to a single inversion at C2 (Walden inversion).\n3. The stereochemistry at C3 is not involved in bond-making or bond-breaking steps and therefore remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore:\n- C2 inverts from S to R.\n- C3 remains S.\n\nThe product is 2-bromo-3-methylpentane with configuration (2R, 3S), which corresponds to choice B.\n\nNo carbocation intermediate is formed under these conditions, so racemization at C2 does not occur, and there are no rearrangements.

A reliable way to enforce overall retention in nucleophilic substitutions at a secondary stereocenter is to design a sequence that accomplishes two consecutive bimolecular substitutions (Sₙ2) at that carbon, because each Sₙ2 step inverts the configuration, and two inversions result in net retention.\n\nLet's trace the stereochemistry for the proposed two-step sequences:\n(R)-alcohol → [Step 1] → Intermediate → [Step 2] → (R)-chloride\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- **A. 1. PBr₃; 2. NaCl in acetone:**\n    - Step 1: Reaction with PBr₃ is an Sₙ2 reaction that converts the alcohol to a bromide with inversion of configuration. (R)-octan-2-ol → (S)-2-bromooctane.\n    - Step 2: Reaction of the bromide with NaCl in acetone is another Sₙ2 reaction. The chloride nucleophile displaces the bromide with a second inversion of configuration. (S)-2-bromooctane → (R)-2-chlorooctane.\n    - Overall: Inversion + Inversion = Retention. This sequence achieves the desired outcome.\n\n- **B. 1. TsCl in Py; 2. LiCl:**\n    - Step 1: Reaction with TsCl/Py converts the alcohol to a tosylate (-OTs). This reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break the C-O bond, so the configuration at the stereocenter is retained. (R)-octan-2-ol → (R)-octan-2-yl tosylate.\n    - Step 2: Reaction with LiCl displaces the tosylate (a good leaving group) via an Sₙ2 mechanism, causing inversion. (R)-tosylate → (S)-2-chlorooctane.\n    - Overall: Retention + Inversion = Inversion. This sequence gives the wrong stereoisomer.\n\n- **C. SOCl₂ in diethyl ether:** This is a single-step reaction. It often proceeds via an Sₙi mechanism with retention of configuration. However, the problem explicitly states that a two-step sequence is required, making this option incorrect by the problem's constraints.\n\n- **D. SOCl₂ in Py:** This is a single-step reaction that proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, causing inversion. It does not give the desired retention.\n\n- **E. 1. NaH; 2. CHCl₃:** Step 1 forms the sodium alkoxide. Step 2, reacting it with chloroform, does not lead to the desired substitution and is not a valid route to 2-chlorooctane.\n\nTherefore, the only provided two-step sequence that enforces two Sₙ2 inversions and achieves overall retention at the stereocenter is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2163341"}]}
