The acid-catalyzed dehydration of alcohols is a prime example, where the pathway—either a two-step E1 or a concerted E2 mechanism—depends on the alcohol's substitution. This exercise [@problem_id:2166242] invites you to act as a peer reviewer, critiquing a common misconception about the dehydration of primary alcohols and reinforcing the fundamental principles of carbocation stability.", "problem": "A student in an introductory organic chemistry course is asked to propose a mechanism for the acid-catalyzed dehydration of 1-butanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$) with concentrated sulfuric acid ($\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4$) at high temperature. The student proposes the following two-step mechanism, which primarily aims to explain the formation of 1-butene:\n\n**Step 1:** Protonation of the hydroxyl oxygen atom of 1-butanol by sulfuric acid to form a protonated alcohol (an oxonium ion).\n$$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4 \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}_2^+ + \\text{HSO}_4^- $$\n\n**Step 2:** The protonated alcohol loses a molecule of water to form a primary carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then loses a proton from an adjacent carbon to yield 1-butene.\n$$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}_2^+ \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2^+ + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\quad (\\text{slow step}) $$\n$$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2^+ + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH=CH}_2 + \\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+ $$\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate chemical critique of the student's proposed mechanism?\n\nA. The mechanism is entirely correct. The formation of a primary carbocation is a common feature of elimination reactions involving primary alcohols.\n\nB. Step 1 is incorrect. The strong acid should deprotonate a carbon atom adjacent to the hydroxyl group to initiate an E1cb-type mechanism.\n\nC. Step 2 contains a significant flaw. The formation of a primary carbocation is a very high-energy, disfavored process. The reaction is more likely to proceed via a single, concerted E2 step, avoiding a carbocation intermediate altogether.\n\nD. Step 2 is incorrect because the primary carbocation would be attacked by the bisulfate ion ($\\text{HSO}_4^-$) in an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ reaction to form butyl sulfate, preventing alkene formation.\n\nE. The proposed mechanism is plausible but incomplete. The primary carbocation described in Step 2 would not lead to 1-butene directly; it would first undergo a 1,2-hydride shift to form a more stable secondary carbocation.", "solution": "The overall dehydration of a primary alcohol under strongly acidic, high-temperature conditions proceeds by first activating the hydroxyl group as a better leaving group via protonation, followed by C–H bond cleavage and C–O bond cleavage in a single concerted step that avoids formation of a primary carbocation.\n\nFirst, acid–base protonation of the alcohol oxygen converts the poor leaving group OH into the good leaving group H_{2}O:\n$$\n\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}_{2}^{+} + \\text{HSO}_{4}^{-}.\n$$\nThis step is chemically reasonable because protonation increases the leaving ability of the group attached to carbon by forming neutral water.\n\nThe student’s Step 2 proposes unimolecular loss of water to form a primary carbocation, followed by deprotonation to give 1-butene. This contains the key flaw: formation of a primary carbocation is highly unfavorable due to carbocation stability trends (tertiary $>$ secondary $ \\gg $ primary). Under strongly acidic conditions, primary alcohols dehydrate by an E2 mechanism after protonation of the hydroxyl group, in which C–H bond cleavage at the $\\beta$-carbon and C–O bond cleavage occur synchronously, thereby avoiding a discrete primary carbocation intermediate. A representative concerted step is:\n$$\n\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}_{2}^{+} + \\text{HSO}_{4}^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH=CH}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O},\n$$\nor, using water as the base,\n$$\n\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}_{2}^{+} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH=CH}_{2} + \\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+}.\n$$\nThese pathways are concerted eliminations (E2) and avoid a high-energy primary carbocation.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because invoking a primary carbocation as a standard feature is not accurate; primary carbocations are strongly disfavored.\n- Option B is incorrect because in strongly acidic media the first step is protonation of the hydroxyl oxygen, not deprotonation of a $\\beta$-carbon to initiate E1cb; E1cb requires a poor leaving group and basic conditions, not strong acid.\n- Option C is correct: the flaw is the proposed formation of a primary carbocation; the reaction proceeds instead by a single concerted E2 step after protonation.\n- Option D is incorrect because nucleophilic capture of a carbocation is not an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ process, and the premise of a primary carbocation is itself inappropriate under these conditions.\n- Option E is incorrect because it presupposes a primary carbocation that would rearrange; the operative pathway for a primary alcohol under these conditions avoids carbocation formation altogether.\n\nThus, the most accurate critique is that Step 2 is flawed and the reaction proceeds via concerted E2 elimination after protonation, avoiding a primary carbocation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2166242"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of the underlying mechanism, we can begin to predict the products of a reaction.

For disubstituted internal alkenes, the trans isomer is usually favored over the cis due to lower steric strain.\n\nAnalysis of options:\n- A. 3-Pentanol: Dehydration yields pentenes (primarily 2-pentene), not a hexene. Rejected due to carbon count mismatch.\n- B. 2-Hexanol: Dehydration forms a secondary carbocation at C2. Elimination will primarily yield 2-hexene (Zaitsev product) and some 1-hexene. It will not form 3-hexene.\n- C. 3-Hexanol: Protonation and loss of water form a secondary carbocation at C3. Beta deprotonation from C2 gives 2-hexene, and deprotonation from C4 gives 3-hexene.

Zaitsev’s rule predicts that the major alkene is the most substituted one available from the accessible carbocation(s).\n\nThe target alkene, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, is the fully substituted internal double bond with the structure in which both alkene carbons each bear two methyl groups. This product is most directly formed from a tertiary carbocation centered at the carbon that will become part of the double bond.\n\nConsider each candidate alcohol:\n\nA. 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol. Protonation of the hydroxyl followed by loss of water generates a secondary carbocation at C2. The adjacent carbon C3 is quaternary (no hydrogens), so direct elimination to give the internal double bond C2=C3 is not possible without rearrangement. A 1,2-methyl shift from C3 to C2 converts the C2 secondary carbocation into a more stable tertiary carbocation at C3. From this tertiary carbocation, deprotonation at C2 gives the internal, tetrasubstituted alkene 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene as the Zaitsev product. Therefore A can give the required major product.\n\nB. 2,3-dimethyl-1-butanol. This is a primary alcohol. Under acid-catalyzed dehydration, primary substrates do not form a stable carbocation and typically dehydrate by an E2 pathway, giving a terminal alkene from C1–C2 elimination. Although one could invoke hydride/methyl shifts to reach a tertiary carbocation, the standard outcome under dehydration conditions is not the symmetric, fully substituted internal alkene as the major product. Thus B does not reliably furnish 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene as the major product.\n\nC. 2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol. Protonation and loss of water give a tertiary carbocation directly at C2. Elimination to either side leads to the same internal double bond C2=C3, furnishing 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene as the Zaitsev product. This alcohol cleanly gives the target alkene as the major (indeed, essentially unique) product.\n\nD. 4-methyl-2-pentanol. Dehydration gives alkenes in the methylpentene series (e.g., 4-methyl-2-pentene) rather than the symmetric 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene. No rearrangement pathway leads to the symmetric tetrasubstituted butene as the major product. Thus D is not suitable.\n\nE. 2-methyl-2-pentanol. Loss of water gives a tertiary carbocation at C2 that eliminates to 2-methyl-2-pentene as the Zaitsev product. There is no driving force for rearrangement to the different carbon framework of 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene. Thus E is not suitable.\n\nTherefore, the two alcohols that give 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene as the major product under acid-catalyzed dehydration are A and C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2166192"}]}
