One common strategy for protecting alcohols is to convert them into silyl ethers. Consider the reaction in which cyclohexanol is treated with trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N). Which of the following is the major organic product formed in this reaction?\n\nA. (cyclohexan-1-yloxy)(trimethyl)silane\nB. 1-chlorocyclohexane\nC. 1-(trimethylsilyl)cyclohexan-1-ol\nD. Cyclohexene\nE. N,N-diethylcyclohexanamine", "solution": "The relevant principle is that alcohols are commonly protected as silyl ethers using a silyl chloride and a base. Here, trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) reacts with the alcohol oxygen as a silicon electrophile, while triethylamine serves as an HCl scavenger to drive the reaction to completion and prevent acid-promoted side reactions.\n\nLet the cyclohexyl group be denoted by $R$. The alcohol is $R\\!-\\!OH$. The silylating agent is $Me_{3}SiCl$ and the base is $Et_{3}N$.\n\nMechanistic sequence:\n1. Nucleophilic attack of the alcohol oxygen on silicon with chloride as the leaving group produces the silyl ether and HCl as the byproduct (net step without the base shown):\n$$\nR\\!-\\!OH + Me_{3}SiCl \\to R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!SiMe_{3} + HCl\n$$\n2. Triethylamine neutralizes the generated HCl, forming the corresponding ammonium chloride salt:\n$$\nEt_{3}N + HCl \\to Et_{3}NH^{+}Cl^{-}\n$$\nCombining these gives the overall transformation:\n$$\nR\\!-\\!OH + Me_{3}SiCl + Et_{3}N \\to R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!SiMe_{3} + Et_{3}NH^{+}Cl^{-}\n$$\nThus, the major organic product is the trimethylsilyl ether of cyclohexanol, namely (cyclohexan-1-yloxy)(trimethyl)silane.\n\nExclusion of other options:\n- 1-chlorocyclohexane is not formed because $Me_{3}SiCl$ does not convert $ROH$ to $RCl$; reagents like $SOCl_{2}$ or $PCl_{3}$ are required for that transformation.\n- 1-(trimethylsilyl)cyclohexan-1-ol would imply retention of the hydroxyl proton; silylation replaces the $O\\!-\\!H$ hydrogen to give an ether, $R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!SiMe_{3}$, not an $O\\!-\\!H$ containing product.\n- Cyclohexene is not formed because dehydration conditions (strong acid, heat) are absent.\n- N,N-diethylcyclohexanamine would require nucleophilic substitution by a secondary amine; triethylamine is a tertiary amine used as a base and does not substitute.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the silyl ether product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2192575"}, {"introduction": "Real-world synthesis often involves molecules with multiple functional groups, requiring chemists to protect one while leaving another available for reaction. This practice problem moves beyond simple protection and into the realm of strategy, asking you to achieve regioselectivity in the protection of a diol [@problem_id:2192597]. You will learn how the steric bulk of different silylating agents can be a powerful tool to selectively target the less sterically hindered alcohol.", "problem": "A chemist is designing a synthesis that requires the selective mono-protection of *cis*-cyclohexane-1,2-diol. To achieve this, one of the two hydroxyl groups must be converted into a silyl ether while leaving the other one free for a subsequent reaction. The chemist has three common silylating reagents available, which are to be used in a stoichiometric amount of one equivalent in the presence of a suitable base like imidazole:\n\n1.  Trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl)\n2.  *tert*-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMSCl)\n3.  *tert*-Butyldiphenylsilyl chloride (TBDPSCl)\n\nThe steric bulk of the silyl groups increases in the order TMS  TBDMS  TBDPS. Assuming the objective is to maximize the yield of a single, stable mono-protected isomer, which of the following choices correctly identifies the most suitable reagent and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. TMSCl is the best choice because its small size and high reactivity ensure a rapid reaction to form the mono-protected product before any di-protection can occur.\nB. TBDMSCl is the best choice because its significant steric bulk allows it to selectively react with the sterically less hindered hydroxyl group, leading to a high yield of a single constitutional isomer.\nC. TBDPSCl is the best choice because it is the most sterically hindered reagent, which will completely prevent the reaction from proceeding to the di-protected stage under any conditions.\nD. None of the reagents will be effective; a statistical mixture of unreacted starting material, two different mono-protected products, and the di-protected product will inevitably form because the two hydroxyl groups are chemically equivalent.", "solution": "The key mechanistic step in silylation with a silyl chloride in the presence of a base such as imidazole is nucleophilic substitution at silicon: the base assists deprotonation of the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which then performs an $\\text{S}_\\text{N}2$-type attack on the silicon center, displacing chloride. The rate and selectivity of this process are highly sensitive to steric hindrance both at the silicon electrophile and around the oxygen nucleophile.\n\nIn cis-cyclohexane-1,2-diol, in the lowest-energy chair conformation the two hydroxyl groups are diastereotopic and not chemically equivalent: one is axial and the other equatorial. The equatorial hydroxyl is sterically less hindered than the axial hydroxyl because the axial position experiences additional 1,3-diaxial interactions. Therefore, a bulky silylating reagent will preferentially react at the equatorial hydroxyl, providing regioselective mono-protection.\n\nChoosing among TMSCl, TBDMSCl, and TBDPSCl, the steric bulk increases in the order TMS  TBDMS  TBDPS. TMSCl, being small and highly reactive, tends to give poorer regioselectivity between the two hydroxyls and forms silyl ethers that are relatively labile, so it does not reliably maximize a single, stable mono-protected isomer. TBDMSCl, with substantial steric bulk, is well known to deliver high regioselectivity for the less hindered (equatorial) hydroxyl in 1,2-diols and forms silyl ethers of good stability, making it suitable for isolating a single mono-protected constitutional isomer under conditions using approximately one equivalent of reagent. Although TBDPSCl is even bulkier and often even more robust once formed, the claim that its steric hindrance will “completely prevent” di-protection “under any conditions” is incorrect; with sufficient equivalents and/or forcing conditions, di-protection can occur. Thus option C’s reasoning is invalid, even though bulky reagents generally enhance selectivity. Finally, option D is incorrect because the two hydroxyl groups in cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol are not chemically equivalent; they are diastereotopic due to the cyclohexane chair geometry.\n\nTherefore, the reagent-choice and reasoning that correctly match the objective—maximizing the yield of a single, stable mono-protected isomer by selective reaction at the less hindered hydroxyl—are those in option B (TBDMSCl).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2192597"}, {"introduction": "The true utility of a protecting group is defined not only by its formation but also by its selective removal.
