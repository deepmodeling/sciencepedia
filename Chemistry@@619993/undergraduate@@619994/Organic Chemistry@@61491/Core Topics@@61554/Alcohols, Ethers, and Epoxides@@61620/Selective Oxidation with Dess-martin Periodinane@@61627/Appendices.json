Acidic byproducts, once converted to sodium carboxylates, and reduced iodine species are water-soluble and move into the aqueous layer. A subsequent brine wash helps to remove residual water and salts from the organic layer, facilitating drying.

While it neutralizes acids, strong base can induce side reactions such as enolate formation, double-bond isomerization, or migration, risking loss of the $(Z)$-alkene geometry and potential rearrangements. It also does not specifically address iodine oxidants. Thus, it is not preferred.\n- Option C employs saturated $\\text{NaHCO}_{3}$ to neutralize acids and $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{S}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}$ to reduce iodine species, with explicit venting for $\\text{CO}_{2}$, followed by brine wash and drying—this directly addresses all key needs and is the standard DMP workup.\n- Option D uses only $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{S}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}$; acids remain unneutralized and can persist in the organic layer, compromising purity and potentially causing downstream issues. Not optimal.\n- Option E assumes the ketone partitions into the aqueous layer and suggests discarding the organic layer; this is chemically incorrect for a neutral ketone in $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{Cl}_{2}$.
