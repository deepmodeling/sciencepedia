The key principles are: (i) protonation of the ether oxygen by hydronium to form an oxonium ion, (ii) subsequent cleavage of a carbon–oxygen bond, and (iii) capture of the resulting cationic species by the most available nucleophile.\n\nStep 1: Protonation of the ether oxygen. In aqueous HCl, the ether oxygen is protonated by $H_3O^+$ to give the corresponding oxonium ion. This activation renders both C–O bonds more labile.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the two possible cleavage pathways of the protonated tertiary alkyl methyl ether.\n- Pathway A ($S_N1$ at the tertiary center): Cleavage of the C–O bond to the tertiary carbon yields a tertiary carbocation (1-methylcyclopentyl cation) and methanol as the leaving group. This is favored because the carbocation is tertiary and thus relatively stabilized, and because chloride is a weak, highly solvated nucleophile in water, making the alternative bimolecular pathway less competitive.\n- Pathway B ($S_N2$ at the methyl group): Chloride could attack the methyl group of the protonated ether via an $S_N2$ displacement to form chloromethane and the tertiary alcohol. However, under dilute aqueous HCl, $Cl^-$ is a relatively poor nucleophile due to solvation and lower nucleophilicity compared to $Br^-$ or $I^-$, so this pathway is disfavored relative to the $S_N1$ route.\n\nStep 3: Capture of the carbocation. From Pathway A, the tertiary carbocation is formed. In aqueous solution, water is the most abundant nucleophile and captures the carbocation to give the oxonium form of 1-methylcyclopentan-1-ol, which then deprotonates to furnish 1-methylcyclopentan-1-ol. Although $Cl^-$ could also capture the carbocation to form 1-chloro-1-methylcyclopentane, water capture dominates under dilute aqueous conditions.\n\nStep 4: Identify the two major organic products. The methoxy fragment departs as methanol, and the carbocation is converted to the tertiary alcohol. Therefore, the two major products are 1-methylcyclopentan-1-ol and methanol.\n\nComparing to the options, this corresponds to choice D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2151820"}]}
