This exercise [@problem_id:2156557] focuses on the stereospecific nature of the base-catalyzed epoxide opening.

An unequal mixture of two chiral diastereomers is formed.\nE. A racemic mixture of two chiral diastereomers is formed.", "solution": "The substrate is cis-2,3-dimethyloxirane, which is an achiral meso epoxide bearing two stereocenters with opposite configurations (one carbon is R and the other is S). In a basic medium with methoxide as nucleophile, epoxide opening proceeds by an $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ mechanism at an epoxide carbon, characterized by backside attack at the less substituted carbon and inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked. For cis-2,3-dimethyloxirane, both epoxide carbons are equivalent (each secondary), so attack at either carbon is equally probable.\n\nMechanistically, methoxide attacks one epoxide carbon with inversion at that center, breaking the C–O bond at the attacked carbon and leaving the oxygen attached to the other carbon as an alkoxide. After ring opening, the alkoxide is protonated in the aqueous acid workup to give an alcohol. The stereochemical consequence is that the configuration at the attacked carbon inverts, while the configuration at the non-attacked carbon remains unchanged; the nucleophile and the oxygen substituent add in an overall anti fashion.\n\nStarting from the meso epoxide with configurations R,S, attack at the R center gives inversion to S at that carbon while the other S center is retained, yielding the S,S product. Conversely, attack at the S center gives inversion to R at that carbon while the other R center is retained, yielding the R,R product. These two products are non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and are formed in equal amounts because the two epoxide carbons are enantiotopic in the meso substrate and the nucleophile and conditions are achiral.\n\nThe products are thus chiral and not meso, because the two adjacent stereocenters bear different substituents (OMe on one carbon and OH on the other), which precludes an internal mirror plane. The acid workup only protonates the alkoxide and does not alter stereochemistry further.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of two chiral enantiomers, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2156557"}, {"introduction": "A true test of understanding is the ability to work backward from an outcome to its cause. In this \"chemical detective\" problem [@problem_id:2156566], you are given the final product of an epoxide ring-opening and tasked with identifying the unknown starting epoxide. This practice will challenge you to apply your knowledge of regioselectivity in a reverse-synthetic manner, reinforcing the deep connection between reaction mechanism and molecular structure.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is tasked with identifying an unknown epoxide. The compound has the molecular formula $C_4H_8O$. The student treats the unknown epoxide with a solution of sodium ethoxide ($NaOCH_2CH_3$) in ethanol, followed by a mild aqueous workup. After purification, the only organic product isolated is conclusively identified as 1-ethoxy-2-butanol. Based on this experimental outcome, determine the correct constitutional isomer of the starting epoxide from the list of choices below.\n\nA. Tetrahydrofuran\nB. *cis*-2,3-dimethyloxirane\nC. 2-ethyloxirane\nD. 2,2-dimethyloxirane\nE. *trans*-2,3-dimethyloxirane", "solution": "We are told the unknown is an epoxide with formula $C_4H_8O$ that, upon treatment with sodium ethoxide ($NaOCH_2CH_3$) in ethanol followed by mild aqueous workup, gives a single product identified as 1-ethoxy-2-butanol.\n\nStep 1: Identify which choices match an epoxide and the formula $C_4H_8O$.\n- Tetrahydrofuran (A) is not an epoxide; although it has formula $C_4H_8O$, it is a five-membered cyclic ether and is not expected to undergo the described base-promoted epoxide opening.\n- The epoxide constitutional isomers with formula $C_4H_8O$ are 2-ethyloxirane (C), 2,2-dimethyloxirane (D), and 2,3-dimethyloxirane (B and E, cis or trans).\n\nThus the candidate epoxides are B, C, D, E.\n\nStep 2: Apply the regioselectivity of base-promoted epoxide opening.\n- Under basic conditions with an alkoxide nucleophile, the reaction proceeds by an $\\mathrm{S_N2}$-type attack at the less substituted epoxide carbon, opening the ring anti to the leaving oxygen, to give an alkoxide at the more substituted epoxide carbon. Mild aqueous workup then protonates that alkoxide to give the alcohol. Therefore, after reaction:\n  - The nucleophile (ethoxide) ends up on the less substituted epoxide carbon.\n  - The hydroxyl group ends up on the more substituted epoxide carbon.\n\nStep 3: Match the observed product connectivity.\n- The observed product is 1-ethoxy-2-butanol. This connectivity is consistent with an epoxide in which one epoxide carbon is primary (less substituted) and the other is secondary and bears an ethyl substituent (more substituted). Under base-promoted opening, ethoxide must add to the primary epoxide carbon (less substituted), and the secondary epoxide carbon (bearing ethyl) must become the alcohol after workup. The resulting structure is $CH_2(OCH_2CH_3)–CH(OH)–CH_2–CH_3$, which is named 1-ethoxy-2-butanol when numbering the butane chain to give the hydroxyl the lowest number.\n\nStep 4: Test each epoxide candidate against this requirement.\n- 2-ethyloxirane (C): This epoxide has one ring carbon unsubstituted (CH₂, primary) and the other ring carbon bearing an ethyl substituent (secondary). By the base-promoted rule, ethoxide attacks the CH₂ ring carbon (less substituted), placing $OCH_2CH_3$ there, while the ring oxygen remains attached to the secondary carbon (bearing ethyl) and becomes OH after workup. This directly gives 1-ethoxy-2-butanol as the sole regioisomer.\n- 2,2-dimethyloxirane (D): One epoxide carbon bears two methyl groups (tertiary after opening), the other is CH₂ (primary). Ethoxide would add to the primary carbon, and the tertiary carbon would become an OH-bearing center. The product would be a tertiary alcohol (a 2-methyl-2-alkanol ether), not 1-ethoxy-2-butanol. The carbon skeleton and substitution pattern do not match the observed product.\n- 2,3-dimethyloxirane (B and E): Both epoxide carbons are secondary (each bearing a methyl), so there is no less-substituted site; attack at either carbon leads to the same connectivity $HO–CH(CH_3)–CH(CH_3)–OCH_2CH_3$, i.e., an ether-alcohol with both vicinal carbons secondary. This corresponds to a different positional isomer (not 1-ethoxy-2-butanol). Moreover, cis/trans affects stereochemistry but not the required regiochemistry; neither gives the named product.\n\nTherefore, only 2-ethyloxirane (C) gives 1-ethoxy-2-butanol as the sole product under the stated conditions.\n\nConclusion: The correct starting epoxide is 2-ethyloxirane, option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2156566"}]}
