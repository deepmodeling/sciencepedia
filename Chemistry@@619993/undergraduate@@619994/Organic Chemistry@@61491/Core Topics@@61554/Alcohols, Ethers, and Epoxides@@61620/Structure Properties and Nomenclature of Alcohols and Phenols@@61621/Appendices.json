A primary alcohol has its hydroxyl-bearing carbon attached to only one other carbon (i.e., a $\\mathrm{CH_{2}OH}$ group in aliphatic cases). A chiral molecule must contain at least one tetrahedral carbon attached to four different substituents (a stereogenic center).\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Pentan-1-ol: Structure $\\mathrm{HO{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{3}}$.

The $\\mathrm{C{-}OH}$ carbon is bonded to $\\mathrm{OH}$, $\\mathrm{H}$, $\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$, and $\\mathrm{C_{3}H_{7}}$ (four different groups), so it is a stereogenic center and the molecule is chiral.

This practice problem asks you to compare the acidities of an alkyl alcohol, a fluorinated alcohol, and a phenol, providing a clear illustration of competing electronic effects. By analyzing how resonance and induction stabilize the conjugate base, you will develop a robust framework for predicting acidity trends across different classes of organic compounds. [@problem_id:2205902]", "problem": "Consider the following three organic compounds:\n*   Compound I: Ethanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$)\n*   Compound II: 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol ($\\text{CF}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$)\n*   Compound III: Phenol ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH}$)\n\nYour task is to rank these three compounds in order of increasing acidity (from least acidic to most acidic) and identify the primary structural reasons for this trend. Select the option that presents both the correct order and the most accurate chemical justification.\n\nA. The correct order of increasing acidity is I < II < III. This is because the conjugate base of III is stabilized by resonance, while the conjugate base of II is stabilized by the strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group. The conjugate base of I has no significant stabilizing effects.\n\nB. The correct order of increasing acidity is I < III < II. This is because the inductive effect from the three fluorine atoms in II provides more stabilization to the conjugate base than the resonance delocalization in the conjugate base of III.\n\nC. The correct order of increasing acidity is III < II < I. This is because the phenyl group in III is electron-donating by resonance, destabilizing the conjugate base and making it the weakest acid.\n\nD. The correct order of increasing acidity is I < II < III. This is because the conjugate base of III is stabilized by the inductive effect of its sp2-hybridized carbons, and this effect is stronger than the stabilization from hyperconjugation in the conjugate base of II.\n\nE. The correct order of increasing acidity is II < I < III. This is because the fluorine atoms in II are highly electronegative, which destabilizes the O-H bond through steric hindrance, making dissociation less favorable.", "solution": "Acidity comparisons are made by considering the equilibrium $\\text{ROH} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{RO}^{-} + \\text{H}^{+}$: the more stabilized the conjugate base $\\text{RO}^{-}$, the larger $K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and the smaller $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$, with $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}=-\\log_{10}(K_{\\mathrm{a}})$. Thus, increased stabilization of the conjugate base implies increased acidity.\n\nFor Compound I (ethanol), deprotonation gives ethoxide, $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{O}^{-}$. This anion has no resonance stabilization; moreover, the alkyl group exerts a weak electron-donating inductive effect, which slightly concentrates negative charge on oxygen, destabilizing the anion. Therefore, ethanol is the least acidic among the three.\n\nFor Compound II (2,2,2-trifluoroethanol), deprotonation gives $\\text{CF}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{O}^{-}$. The $\\text{CF}_{3}$ group is a strong electron-withdrawing group by induction due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms. This $-I$ effect withdraws electron density through $\\sigma$ bonds and stabilizes the negative charge on oxygen. There is still no resonance delocalization of the negative charge, so the stabilization is purely inductive and decreases with distance, but it is substantial here, making II more acidic than I.\n\nFor Compound III (phenol), deprotonation gives phenoxide, $\\text{C}_{6}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{O}^{-}$. The negative charge on oxygen is delocalized into the aromatic ring via resonance, producing multiple contributing structures with charge distributed onto the ortho and para carbons. Resonance delocalization provides strong stabilization of the conjugate base, typically exceeding purely inductive effects. Hence, phenol is the most acidic of the three.\n\nTherefore, the acidity increases in the order I (no significant stabilization, slight destabilization by $+I$) < II (strong $-I$ stabilization by $\\text{CF}_{3}$) < III (resonance stabilization of phenoxide). Among the options, this order and its correct justification correspond to option A. Option D, although giving the same order, incorrectly attributes phenoxide stabilization to inductive effects of $\\text{sp}^{2}$-hybridized carbons rather than resonance, and mischaracterizes the stabilization in II as hyperconjugation rather than an inductive $-I$ effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205902"}, {"introduction": "A true test of a chemist's understanding is the ability to synthesize knowledge from different areas to solve a complex problem. This practice moves beyond static structures to explore their chemical reactivity.

This collection of compounds includes both alcohols and ethers. The entire mixture is then treated with an excess of hot, concentrated hydrobromic acid (HBr). This chemical treatment is known to convert all alcohol functional groups into their corresponding alkyl bromides and to cleave all ether functional groups, also forming their corresponding alkyl bromides. Assuming all reactions proceed to completion without any skeletal rearrangements, how many distinct organic bromide-containing compounds are present in the final product mixture?", "solution": "We first enumerate all acyclic constitutional isomers with formula $C_{4}H_{10}O$.

Thus there is no duplication between the two sets. Stereoisomers (e.g., 2-bromobutane enantiomers) are not counted separately since the problem concerns constitutional distinctness.\n\nTherefore, the final product mixture contains $4$ distinct bromides from the alcohols and $4$ distinct bromides from the ethers, for a total of $4+4=8$ distinct organic bromide-containing compounds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "2205940"}]}
