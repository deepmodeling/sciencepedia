The phenoxide conjugate base is stabilized when its negative charge can be delocalized into the ring and further onto the nitro group via resonance. This resonance interaction occurs when $-\\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ is ortho or para to the $O^{-}$, but not when it is meta. Therefore:\n- Ortho- and para-nitrophenoxide ions are stabilized by both $-I$ and $-M$ effects.\n- Meta-nitrophenoxide is stabilized only by the $-I$ effect (no effective resonance delocalization to the nitro group at the meta position).\n\nHence, meta-nitrophenol is the least acidic (highest $pK_{a}$), while ortho and para are more acidic (lower $pK_{a}$) than meta.\n\nBetween ortho and para, both permit resonance stabilization, but additional structural effects differentiate them in aqueous solution:\n- Ortho-nitrophenol in its neutral form is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the phenolic $\\mathrm{O–H}$ and a nitro oxygen. This preferentially stabilizes the acid relative to its conjugate base, decreasing $K_{a}$ (raising $pK_{a}$) compared to the para isomer.\n- The ortho-nitrophenoxide anion is less effectively solvated due to steric hindrance and can experience through-space electrostatic repulsion between the phenoxide $O^{-}$ and nearby nitro oxygens, which destabilizes the anion relative to the para isomer.\n\nConsequently, although both ortho and para allow resonance delocalization, para-nitrophenol is more acidic than ortho-nitrophenol in water, giving:\n$$\\text{acidity (strength)}:\\ \\text{para} > \\text{ortho} > \\text{meta} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\text{increasing } pK_{a}:\\ \\text{para} < \\text{ortho} < \\text{meta}.$$\n\nMatching to the options, this corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2152717"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of an acid is not only determined by its structure but also by its environment.
