This exercise explores this difference by examining how the products of each reaction behave in a classic qualitative test, the Tollens' test. By understanding why aldehydes give a positive test while ketones do not, you will solidify your knowledge of the structural differences between these products and how those differences govern their chemical behavior [@problem_id:2187351].", "problem": "An organic chemist is working with two isomeric alcohols, 1-butanol and 2-butanol. Each alcohol is subjected to a mild oxidation reaction using a reagent like pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC). The product from the oxidation of 1-butanol is labeled Product P, and the product from the oxidation of 2-butanol is labeled Product S. Both products are then tested with Tollens' reagent, which consists of a basic aqueous solution containing the diamminesilver(I) complex, $\\left[\\text{Ag}(\\text{NH}_3)_2\\right]^+$. A positive Tollens' test is indicated by the formation of a silver mirror on the inner surface of the test tube. The chemist observes that Product P gives a positive Tollens' test, whereas Product S does not.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental chemical reason for this difference in reactivity?\n\nA. The oxidation of 1-butanol, a primary alcohol, yields butanal, an aldehyde which possesses an oxidizable hydrogen atom on its carbonyl carbon. The oxidation of 2-butanol, a secondary alcohol, yields butan-2-one, a ketone, which lacks this specific hydrogen atom and is thus resistant to further mild oxidation.\n\nB. The carbonyl group in butan-2-one (Product S) is significantly more sterically hindered by its two adjacent alkyl groups compared to the carbonyl group in butanal (Product P), preventing the large $\\left[\\text{Ag}(\\text{NH}_3)_2\\right]^+$ complex from approaching for a reaction.\n\nC. Under the basic conditions of the Tollens' test, butan-2-one (Product S) is completely converted into its more stable enol tautomer, which is unreactive towards oxidizing agents. Butanal (Product P) does not form a stable enol.\n\nD. Mild oxidation converts 1-butanol directly into butanoic acid, which undergoes a vigorous acid-base reaction with the basic Tollens' reagent. In contrast, 2-butanol, being a secondary alcohol, is completely unreactive to mild oxidizing agents like PCC.\n\nE. The Tollens' test relies on the organic compound acting as the oxidizing agent. Aldehydes like butanal are sufficiently strong oxidizing agents to reduce silver ions, whereas ketones like butan-2-one are not.", "solution": "First, identify the oxidation products under the specified conditions. Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild, anhydrous oxidizing agent that converts primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones without overoxidation to carboxylic acids. Therefore, oxidation of 1-butanol (a primary alcohol) yields butanal (Product P), and oxidation of 2-butanol (a secondary alcohol) yields butan-2-one (Product S).\n\nSecond, state the nature of Tollens' reagent and the fundamental redox principle of the test. Tollens' reagent is an oxidizing agent consisting of the diamminesilver(I) complex $\\left[\\text{Ag}(\\text{NH}_{3})_{2}\\right]^{+}$ in basic aqueous solution. In the Tollens test, the organic substrate is the reducing agent and is oxidized, while silver(I) is reduced to metallic silver, producing a silver mirror. The relevant half-reaction for silver is:\n$$\n\\left[\\text{Ag}(\\text{NH}_{3})_{2}\\right]^{+} + e^{-} \\to \\text{Ag}(s) + 2\\,\\text{NH}_{3}.\n$$\n\nThird, explain why aldehydes are oxidized while typical ketones are not under Tollens conditions. An aldehyde, $R\\text{CHO}$, contains a hydrogen bound to the carbonyl carbon (the aldehydic or formyl hydrogen). Under basic, aqueous conditions it can form a geminal diol (hydrate), and oxidation to the carboxylate $R\\text{COO}^-$ occurs without cleavage of a carbon–carbon bond, increasing the oxidation state of the carbonyl carbon by two units. A representative aldehyde oxidation half-reaction (in water) can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{RCHO} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\to \\text{RCOO}^{-} + 2\\,\\text{H}^{+} + 2\\,e^{-},\n$$\nwith the protons neutralized by base in the Tollens medium. By contrast, a simple ketone $R\\text{COR}'$ lacks a hydrogen on the carbonyl carbon; further oxidation at that carbon would generally require carbon–carbon bond cleavage or much stronger oxidants. Consequently, typical ketones are not oxidized by Tollens' reagent and do not reduce $\\left[\\text{Ag}(\\text{NH}_{3})_{2}\\right]^{+}$ to silver.\n\nFourth, apply this to the specific products. Product P is butanal, an aldehyde with an aldehydic hydrogen; it is oxidized to butanoate under Tollens conditions while reducing silver(I) to silver(0), thus giving a positive test. Product S is butan-2-one, a ketone lacking an aldehydic hydrogen; it is not oxidized by Tollens' reagent and thus gives a negative test.\n\nFinally, evaluate the options:\n- Option A precisely identifies the fundamental reason: aldehydes possess an oxidizable hydrogen on the carbonyl carbon enabling mild oxidation to carboxylates, whereas ketones lack this and resist such oxidation.\n- Option B incorrectly attributes the outcome primarily to steric hindrance; sterics are not the controlling factor in the Tollens test outcome.\n- Option C is incorrect because butan-2-one is not completely converted to its enol under basic conditions, and enol formation is not the fundamental reason for Tollens inactivity.\n- Option D is incorrect because PCC does not directly oxidize primary alcohols to acids and secondary alcohols are indeed oxidized by PCC to ketones.\n- Option E reverses the redox roles; Tollens' reagent is the oxidizing agent, and aldehydes act as the reducing agents.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental chemical reason is given in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2187351"}, {"introduction": "In modern chemistry, structure elucidation rarely relies on a single piece of evidence.

This contradicts the observed 5.\n\nD. 3-Methylbutan-2-ol, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH(OH)-CH(CH}_3)_2$: In the alcohol, C2 is a stereogenic center (attached to $\\text{CH}_3$, $\\text{CH(CH}_3)_2$, $\\text{OH}$, and $\\text{H}$).

The stereocenter at C2 is lost, and the two methyl groups on the isopropyl fragment become equivalent; distinct carbons are the carbonyl carbon, the acetyl methyl, the isopropyl methine, and the pair of equivalent methyls on that methine, totaling 4 signals. This matches the observation.\n\nE. Pentan-3-ol, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH(OH)-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3$: The molecule has a plane of symmetry, so C1 and C5 are equivalent methyls, and C2 and C4 are equivalent methylenes; with the central C3, this gives 3 signals for the alcohol, contradicting the observed 5.\n\nOnly option D yields 5 signals for the alcohol and 4 signals for the PCC oxidation product without changing the carbon skeleton.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2187338"}]}
