The classification of a carbon atom in an organic molecule is determined by the number of other carbon atoms to which it is directly bonded. A primary (1°) carbon is bonded to one other carbon atom, a secondary (2°) carbon is bonded to two other carbon atoms, a tertiary (3°) carbon is bonded to three other carbon atoms, and a quaternary (4°) carbon is bonded to four other carbon atoms.\n\nConsider the molecular formula $C_6H_{14}$.

The relevant principles are:\n- Constitutional isomers share the same molecular formula but differ in connectivity.\n- The general formula for an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) is $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$; for a monocyclic saturated hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) it is $C_{n}H_{2n}$.\n- Carbon classification: a primary carbon is bonded to one other carbon, a secondary to two, a tertiary to three, and a quaternary to four.\n\nFirst, we verify which options are constitutional isomers of $C_6H_{14}$ by formula:\n- Option A: A straight-chain of six carbons is $n$-hexane, which has formula $C_6H_{14}$, so it is an isomer candidate.\n- Option B: A five-carbon chain with one methyl substituent is 2-methylpentane (or its isomer 3-methylpentane depending on placement), both of which have formula $C_6H_{14}$, so isomer candidates.\n- Option C: A four-carbon chain with two methyl groups on the second carbon is 2,2-dimethylbutane, which has formula $C_6H_{14}$, so an isomer candidate.\n- Option D: A six-membered ring is cyclohexane with formula $C_6H_{12}$, not $C_6H_{14}$; therefore not a constitutional isomer.\n- Option E: A five-membered ring with one methyl is methylcyclopentane with formula $C_6H_{12}$; therefore not a constitutional isomer.\n\nNext, among the candidates A, B, and C, we check carbon classifications:\n- Option A (n-hexane): The terminal carbons are primary (each bonded to exactly one carbon), and the four internal carbons are secondary (each bonded to exactly two carbons). There are no tertiary or quaternary carbons. This satisfies the condition of only primary and secondary carbons.\n- Option B (2-methylpentane): The substituted carbon (carbon 2) is bonded to three other carbons (the adjacent chain carbons and the methyl substituent), making it a tertiary carbon. This violates the requirement.\n- Option C (2,2-dimethylbutane): The substituted carbon (carbon 2) is bonded to four other carbons (two chain carbons and two methyl substituents), making it a quaternary carbon.

This practice introduces the concept of \"degrees of unsaturation\" (DBE), a simple calculation that provides immense insight into a molecule's structure from its formula alone.

This thought experiment challenges you to act as a critical chemist, evaluating a proposed structure against the fundamental laws of chemical bonding. By applying VSEPR theory to assess the severe angle strain in a hypothetical small-ring alkyne, you will develop a crucial understanding that molecular drawings are not just cartoons, but representations that must obey the strict geometric rules dictated by electron orbital hybridization. [@problem_id:2186441]", "problem": "An introductory organic chemistry student, after learning about alkynes and cyclic alkanes, attempts to draw the structure of a molecule she names \"cyclopentyne\". She describes her drawing as a skeletal structure that looks like a regular pentagon, where one of the five sides is a triple bond and the other four are single bonds. Her instructor immediately points out that while the name is correct, the drawing represents a geometrically impossible structure. Which of the following statements best explains the fundamental flaw in the student's described drawing?\n\nA. The linear geometry required for sp-hybridized carbons, which dictates a 180° bond angle, cannot be accommodated within the small five-membered ring.\n\nB. The name \"cyclopentyne\" is incorrect; cyclic molecules cannot contain triple bonds.\n\nC. The carbons involved in the triple bond violate the octet rule as they are only bonded to two other atoms.\n\nD. The structure is flawed because all five-membered rings must be perfectly planar, which is prevented by the triple bond.\n\nE. A triple bond consists of three pi bonds, which is too much electron density for a small ring to contain.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the main reason why drawing cyclopentyne as a regular pentagon with a triple bond is fundamentally incorrect. We must analyze the geometric requirements of the atoms and bonds involved.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hybridization and geometry associated with a carbon-carbon triple bond (an alkyne). The two carbon atoms participating in the triple bond are sp-hybridized. According to the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, atoms with two electron domains (as is the case for sp-hybridized carbons in an alkyne, which are bonded to two other atoms) adopt a linear geometry. This linear arrangement results in an ideal bond angle of 180° around each of the sp-hybridized carbons. In the context of a $\\text{C-C}\\equiv\\text{C-C}$ unit, the four atoms must lie in a straight line.\n\nNext, let's consider the geometry of the structure described: a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal internal angles. The value of each internal angle in a regular n-gon is given by the formula $(n-2) \\times 180° / n$. For a pentagon, where $n=5$, the internal angle is $(5-2) \\times 180° / 5 = 3 \\times 180° / 5 = 108°$.\n\nNow, we must reconcile these two geometric constraints. The student's drawing forces the sp-hybridized carbons of the triple bond to occupy two vertices of a regular pentagon. This means the C-C≡C bond angle within the ring is being forced to be 108°. This is a massive deviation from the ideal 180° bond angle required for sp-hybridized carbons. The difference, $180° - 108° = 72°$, represents an enormous amount of angle strain. Such a high degree of strain makes the molecule, as drawn, geometrically impossible and energetically prohibitive. Therefore, the primary flaw is the incompatibility of the linear geometry of an alkyne with the acute angles of a small ring like cyclopentane. This aligns perfectly with option A.\n\nLet's analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. The name \"cyclopentyne\" is the correct systematic name for a five-membered ring containing a triple bond. While very small cycloalkynes (like cyclopropyne and cyclobutyne) are too strained to be isolated, larger ones (like cyclooctyne) are stable and well-known. So, the statement that cyclic molecules cannot contain triple bonds is false.\n\nC. In the described structure, each of the two alkyne carbons forms a triple bond with the other alkyne carbon and a single bond with an adjacent ring carbon. Each carbon thus forms four covalent bonds in total (one single + one triple). This satisfies the valency of carbon and the octet rule. The statement that they are \"only bonded to two other atoms\" is true, but this is the correct bonding pattern for an internal alkyne and does not inherently lead to a violation of the octet rule.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect on two counts. First, not all five-membered rings are perfectly planar (e.g., cyclopentane itself exists in a non-planar \"envelope\" conformation to relieve strain). Second, the fundamental issue is not planarity but the severe angle strain imposed on the sp-hybridized carbons, which is a more specific and direct cause of the impossibility of the drawing.\n\nE. A carbon-carbon triple bond consists of one sigma ($\\sigma$) bond and two pi ($\\pi$) bonds, not three pi bonds. This statement contains a factual error about the composition of a triple bond.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2186441"}]}
