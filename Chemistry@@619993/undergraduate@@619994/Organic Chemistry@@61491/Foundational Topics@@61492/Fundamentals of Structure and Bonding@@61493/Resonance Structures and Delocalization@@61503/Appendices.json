Consider the carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bond within the urea molecule. Compare its length to the C-N bond in methylamine, $CH_3NH_2$, a simple amine where a methyl group is attached to an amino group. Based on fundamental principles of chemical bonding, select the correct statement from the options below.\n\nA. The C-N bond in urea is shorter than the C-N bond in methylamine.\n\nB. The C-N bond in urea is longer than the C-N bond in methylamine.\n\nC. The C-N bonds in urea and methylamine have approximately the same length.\n\nD. It is impossible to predict the relative bond lengths without experimental data.", "solution": "We compare the C-N bond in methylamine and urea using fundamental bonding principles.\n\nIn methylamine, $CH_{3}NH_{2}$, the C-N bond is a localized single $\\sigma$ bond between approximately $\\text{sp}^{3}$ hybrid orbitals on carbon and nitrogen with no conjugation to a $\\pi$ system. Thus, the bond order is $n_{\\text{methylamine}}=1$.\n\nIn urea, $O=C(NH_{2})_{2}$, each nitrogen has a lone pair that can delocalize into the carbonyl $\\pi$ system.

By analyzing the possible outcomes of a reaction, we can determine the most likely pathway. In this exercise, you will determine the most basic site of the guanidine molecule by comparing the resonance stabilization of its potential conjugate acids, illustrating a fundamental principle of reactivity. [@problem_id:2197339]", "problem": "Guanidine is a neutral molecule with the chemical formula $CH_5N_3$. Its structure consists of a central carbon atom that is single-bonded to two equivalent amino groups ($-NH_2$) and double-bonded to an imino group ($=NH$). Guanidine is known to be a strong organic base. When it accepts a proton ($H^+$), it forms a cationic conjugate acid. Your task is to identify the most thermodynamically favorable site of protonation on the neutral guanidine molecule.\n\nChoose the correct statement:\n\nA. Protonation occurs on the nitrogen atom of the imino group.\n\nB. Protonation occurs on one of the nitrogen atoms of an amino group.\n\nC. Protonation occurs on the central carbon atom.\n\nD. The amino and imino nitrogens are equally basic and thus equally likely to be protonated.\n\nE. Protonation occurs on one of the hydrogen atoms.", "solution": "We identify the most thermodynamically favorable protonation site by comparing the relative stabilities of the possible conjugate acids formed upon protonation. In Lewis terms, the most basic site is the atom whose lone pair donation to $H^{+}$ yields the most stabilized cation. Stabilization is assessed primarily by resonance delocalization and charge distribution.\n\nThe neutral guanidine described has a central carbon single-bonded to two equivalent amino groups and double-bonded to an imino group, i.e., $(H_2N)_2C=NH$. The potential protonation sites are: the imino nitrogen, either amino nitrogen, the central carbon, or a hydrogen atom.\n\n1) Protonation at the imino nitrogen:\n- If the imino nitrogen accepts $H^{+}$, the product is the guanidinium cation $[C(NH_2)_3]^+$. In this cation, the positive charge is extensively delocalized by resonance over the three nitrogen atoms, and the three $\\mathrm{C{-}N}$ bonds become equivalent with partial double-bond character. There are three equivalent major resonance contributors interconverting by shifting the position of the formal double bond among the three $\\mathrm{C{-}N}$ links while relocating the formal positive charge among the three nitrogens. This extensive, symmetric delocalization provides maximal resonance stabilization for the conjugate acid, making the corresponding basic site (the imino nitrogen) the most basic.\n\n2) Protonation at an amino nitrogen:\n- If an amino nitrogen accepts $H^{+}$, that nitrogen becomes an $NH_3^+$ center without a lone pair, which disrupts its ability to donate electron density into the $C=N$ framework. As a result, resonance delocalization is significantly reduced and the positive charge is localized largely on the protonated amino nitrogen. The conjugate acid is therefore less stabilized than the guanidinium obtained by protonation at the imino nitrogen.\n\n3) Protonation at the central carbon:\n- Protonation at the carbon would place a positive charge in a way that does not benefit from the same extensive delocalization over three nitrogens. Such a carbenium- or iminium-like cation is much less stabilized relative to the guanidinium cation and is not the thermodynamically preferred outcome.\n\n4) Protonation at a hydrogen atom:\n- Hydrogen atoms are not Lewis basic sites (they have no lone pairs to donate), so protonation at hydrogen is not chemically meaningful as a site of basicity.\n\n5) Comparison of basicities of amino versus imino nitrogens:\n- Because protonation at the imino nitrogen uniquely yields the highly resonance-stabilized, symmetric guanidinium cation, the imino nitrogen is more basic than the amino nitrogens. Therefore, the amino and imino nitrogens are not equally basic.\n\nFrom these considerations, the most thermodynamically favorable protonation occurs at the imino nitrogen, yielding the resonance-stabilized guanidinium cation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2197339"}, {"introduction": "Not all forms of electron delocalization provide the same degree of stabilization. This final practice asks you to establish a hierarchy of stability among different carbocations by comparing the effects of simple resonance, extended resonance, and aromaticity.

II < III < I", "solution": "Goal: Rank I (allyl cation), II (benzyl cation), and III (tropylium cation) by increasing stability, using resonance delocalization and aromatic stabilization as the governing principles.\n\nPrinciple 1: Carbocation stability increases with the extent of charge delocalization by resonance. More extensive conjugation and more effective overlap of adjacent p orbitals stabilizes the cation.\n\nPrinciple 2: Aromatic stabilization strongly enhances stability in cyclic, planar, fully conjugated systems that satisfy Hückel’s rule, which requires that the number of delocalized electrons be $4n+2$ for some integer $n$:\n$$\nN_{\\pi}=4n+2\n$$\n\nAnalysis of I (allyl cation, $C_3H_5^+$): The allyl cation is a linear, three-atom conjugated system with one $\\pi$ bond adjacent to an empty p orbital. The $\\pi$ electrons (two electrons) are delocalized over three carbons, giving two principal resonance structures. Although resonance stabilizes the cation, there is no cyclic conjugation; thus, there is no aromatic stabilization. Therefore, stabilization is moderate and arises only from simple allylic resonance.\n\nAnalysis of II (benzyl cation, $C_7H_7^+$ with a $-\\text{CH}_2^+$ attached to a benzene ring): The empty p-orbital on the benzylic carbon is conjugated with the $\\pi$ system of the benzene ring. This allows the positive charge to be delocalized from the benzylic carbon onto the ortho and para positions of the ring. This results in more resonance structures than for the allyl cation, and the charge is spread over a larger area, leading to greater stability. The benzyl cation is significantly more stable than the allyl cation, but it is not an aromatic cation itself.\n\nAnalysis of III (tropylium cation, $C_7H_7^+$ as cycloheptatrienyl cation): This is a planar, cyclic, fully conjugated seven-membered ring with three $\\pi$ bonds (six $\\pi$ electrons) and a delocalized positive charge. The $\\pi$ electron count is\n$$\nN_{\\pi}=6=4(1)+2\n$$\nso with $n=1$, Hückel’s rule is satisfied. Therefore, the tropylium cation is aromatic. Aromatic delocalization stabilizes the cation strongly and uniformly across the entire ring.\n\nConclusion: Carbocation stability increases with the extent of charge delocalization. The allyl cation (I) is stabilized by resonance over three carbons. The benzyl cation (II) is stabilized by more extensive resonance involving the adjacent aromatic ring, making it more stable than allyl. The tropylium cation (III) is the most stable because it is an aromatic species, which is a particularly powerful form of stabilization. The correct order of increasing stability is therefore I < II < III.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2197318"}]}
