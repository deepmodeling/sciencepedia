This requires a two-step process: first, determine the effective number of electrons associated with the carbon atom, and second, write the electron configuration for that number of electrons according to standard rules.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of electrons on the carbon atom.\nA neutral carbon atom has an atomic number of 6, which means it has 6 protons in its nucleus and 6 electrons in its neutral state. The methanide anion, $\\text{CH}_3^{-}$, has an overall charge of -1. To find the electron count on the carbon atom, we can calculate its formal charge.\n\nThe Lewis structure for the methanide anion consists of a central carbon atom single-bonded to three hydrogen atoms and possessing one lone pair of electrons. This arrangement satisfies the octet rule for carbon.\n\nThe formula for formal charge is:\nFormal Charge = (Number of valence electrons in a neutral atom) - (Number of non-bonding electrons) - $\\frac{1}{2}$(Number of bonding electrons)\n\nFor the central carbon atom in $\\text{CH}_3^{-}$:\n- The number of valence electrons in a neutral carbon atom is 4.\n- The number of non-bonding electrons is 2 (from the one lone pair).\n- The number of bonding electrons is 6 (from three single C-H bonds, with 2 electrons per bond).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\nFormal Charge on C = $4 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = 4 - 2 - 3 = -1$.\n\nA formal charge of -1 on the carbon atom indicates that it effectively possesses one more electron than a neutral carbon atom. Therefore, the number of electrons to consider for the electron configuration of this carbon atom is the number of electrons in a neutral carbon atom (6) plus one extra electron, for a total of 7 electrons.\n\nStep 2: Write the ground-state electron configuration for an atom with 7 electrons.\nWe will fill the atomic orbitals in order of increasing energy, following the Aufbau principle ($1s, 2s, 2p, \\dots$).\n\n- The $1s$ orbital is filled first with its maximum capacity of 2 electrons: $1s^2$.\n- The remaining $7 - 2 = 5$ electrons are then placed.\n- The next orbital in energy is the $2s$ orbital, which is filled with its maximum of 2 electrons: $1s^2 2s^2$.\n- The remaining $5 - 2 = 3$ electrons are placed in the next available orbitals.\n- The $2p$ subshell, which can hold up to 6 electrons, receives the final 3 electrons.

By calculating $Z_{eff}$, you will transform the abstract idea of electron shielding into a tangible value, deepening your understanding of the forces that govern all periodic trends.", "problem": "In the field of semiconductor physics, understanding the electronic environment of individual atoms is crucial for predicting the bulk properties of materials. A fundamental parameter is the effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff}$), which represents the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom. This charge is less than the full nuclear charge ($Z$) due to the shielding effect of other electrons. The shielding constant, $S$, can be estimated using a set of empirical guidelines known as Slater's rules. The effective nuclear charge is then given by the relation $Z_{eff} = Z - S$.\n\nFor the purpose of modeling a neutral, isolated silicon atom (atomic number $Z=14$), you are tasked with calculating $Z_{eff}$ for one of its valence electrons. Use the following formulation of Slater's rules to determine the shielding constant, $S$:\n\n1.  First, write the electron configuration of the atom and group the orbitals as follows: $(1s)$, $(2s, 2p)$, $(3s, 3p)$, $(3d)$, $(4s, 4p)$, $(4d)$, etc.\n\n2.

First ionization energy generally increases across a period, yet a curious dip occurs from phosphorus to sulfur. This exercise [@problem_id:2155893] challenges you to delve into the subshell configurations of these atoms to uncover the reason. You will see how the subtle energetic consequences of electron pairing can override the broader trend of increasing nuclear charge, a key insight into the stability of specific electronic arrangements.", "problem": "The first ionization energy, which is the energy required to remove the most loosely held electron from a neutral gaseous atom, generally increases as one moves from left to right across a period in the periodic table. This trend is primarily due to the increasing effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence electrons. However, a notable exception occurs between phosphorus (P, atomic number 15) and sulfur (S, atomic number 16), where the first ionization energy of sulfur is slightly lower than that of phosphorus.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this anomaly?\n\nA. Sulfur has a significantly larger atomic radius than phosphorus, causing its valence electrons to be held less tightly by the nucleus.\n\nB. The electron removed from a sulfur atom originates from a 3d orbital, which is shielded more effectively and at a higher energy level than the 3p orbital from which a phosphorus electron is removed.\n\nC. The electron removed from a sulfur atom is taken from a doubly-occupied 3p orbital. The removal of this electron is facilitated by the reduction of electron-electron repulsion that exists between the paired electrons in that orbital.\n\nD. Phosphorus achieves a highly stable, fully-filled 3p subshell, making the removal of an electron energetically unfavorable compared to sulfur.\n\nE. The effective nuclear charge experienced by a valence electron in sulfur is unexpectedly lower than in phosphorus due to irregular shielding patterns in the third period.", "solution": "We begin with the general periodic trend: the first ionization energy $I_{1}$ tends to increase from left to right across a period because the effective nuclear charge $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ experienced by valence electrons increases, which lowers their energy (binds them more strongly), making their removal more difficult. Symbolically, absent other effects, we expect $I_{1} \\propto f(Z_{\\text{eff}})$ with $f$ increasing across the period.\n\nNext, consider the specific electron configurations:\n- Phosphorus: $\\mathrm{P}: [\\mathrm{Ne}]\\,3s^{2}3p^{3}$. By Hund's rule, the three $3p$ electrons occupy different $p$ orbitals with parallel spins, so there is no electron pairing within any single $3p$ orbital.\n- Sulfur: $\\mathrm{S}: [\\mathrm{Ne}]\\,3s^{2}3p^{4}$. By Hund's rule and the Pauli principle, one of the $3p$ orbitals must contain a pair of electrons, producing a doubly occupied $3p$ orbital.\n\nThe key energetic effect is electron-electron repulsion within a doubly occupied orbital, often represented as a pairing energy contribution $E_{\\text{pair}}>0$. For a paired electron, the total energy is raised by this repulsion relative to an unpaired electron in a singly occupied orbital. Consequently, for sulfur, the electron to be removed in the first ionization process is typically taken from the doubly occupied $3p$ orbital, and its removal decreases electron-electron repulsion by an amount on the order of $E_{\\text{pair}}$. Therefore, the net energy required to remove that electron is effectively lowered by this repulsion relief:\n$$\nI_{1}(\\mathrm{S}) \\approx I_{1}^{\\text{trend}}(\\mathrm{S}) - E_{\\text{pair}},\n$$\nwhere $I_{1}^{\\text{trend}}(\\mathrm{S})$ denotes the ionization energy expected from the monotonic increase with $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ alone. This reduction explains why $I_{1}(\\mathrm{S})<I_{1}(\\mathrm{P})$ despite sulfur having a slightly higher $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ than phosphorus.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- A is inaccurate: across the period, atomic radius generally decreases, and the small difference does not furnish the fundamental cause; moreover sulfur is not significantly larger than phosphorus.\n- B is incorrect: the electron is removed from a $3p$ orbital, not a $3d$ orbital; the $3d$ subshell is not occupied in ground-state P or S.\n- C correctly states that the electron removed from sulfur comes from a doubly occupied $3p$ orbital and that removal reduces electron-electron repulsion, lowering the energy cost.\n- D is incorrect as written: phosphorus does not have a fully filled $3p$ subshell ($3p^{6}$ would be full); it has a half-filled $3p^{3}$ subshell. While half-filled subshell stability is real, the statement is factually wrong and not the most accurate explanation for the anomaly relative to sulfur’s pairing effect.\n- E is incorrect: $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ does not anomalously decrease from P to S; the anomaly arises from subshell pairing repulsion, not from irregular shielding that reverses the $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ trend.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the first ionization of sulfur removes an electron from a paired $3p$ orbital, and the reduction in electron-electron repulsion facilitates this removal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2155893"}]}
