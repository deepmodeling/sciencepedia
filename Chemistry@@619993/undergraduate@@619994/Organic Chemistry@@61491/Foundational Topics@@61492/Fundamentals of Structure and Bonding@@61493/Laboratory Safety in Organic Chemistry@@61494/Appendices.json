This next exercise explores a quenching step in a Birch reduction, a classic reaction involving cryogenic liquids and highly reactive metals. Your task is to dissect the situation to identify both a severe chemical hazard and a critical physical hazard that occur simultaneously, reinforcing the need for a comprehensive safety analysis. [@problem_id:2181858]", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is conducting a Birch reduction, a process that uses an alkali metal dissolved in liquid ammonia to reduce an aromatic ring. The reaction is performed in an open-system flask (e.g., a three-neck flask fitted with a dry-ice condenser) at the boiling point of ammonia, which is -33 °C. After the aromatic substrate has been consumed, significant pieces of unreacted solid sodium metal remain in the intensely blue solution. To neutralize the excess sodium, the student then attempts to quench the reaction by adding room-temperature ethanol directly from a reagent bottle into the reaction flask. This procedure is extremely hazardous due to a combination of two distinct and immediate risks. Which of the following choices best describes the dual nature of the immediate risk, combining both a chemical and a physical hazard?\n\nA. A vigorous chemical reaction produces a flammable gas, and the added ethanol will freeze upon contact, causing the flask to crack due to thermal shock.\n\nB. The sodium metal will react with ammonia to form highly explosive sodium amide, and the flask will over-pressurize from the production of nitrogen gas.\n\nC. A highly exothermic chemical reaction will generate large volumes of flammable hydrogen gas, and the large temperature difference will cause the liquid ammonia to boil violently, splashing the corrosive contents.\n\nD. The sodium and ethanol will react to form sodium hydride, which is pyrophoric, and the ammonia will rapidly decompose into nitrogen and hydrogen.\n\nE. The ethanol will react with the dissolved electron (solvated electron) to produce ethylene gas, which is flammable, and the cryogenic ammonia will sublimate, creating a toxic atmosphere.", "solution": "The reaction mixture after a Birch reduction contains excess sodium metal suspended in liquid ammonia with solvated electrons. Sodium dissolves to give a deep blue solution of cations and solvated electrons:\n$$\\text{Na(s)} \\to \\text{Na}^{+}(\\text{am}) + e^{-}(\\text{am}).$$\nWhen room-temperature ethanol is added directly, two rapid, exothermic chemical processes occur that liberate flammable hydrogen gas. First, sodium metal reacts with ethanol by proton transfer to form sodium ethoxide and hydrogen:\n$$2\\,\\text{Na} + 2\\,\\text{EtOH} \\to 2\\,\\text{NaOEt} + \\text{H}_{2}\\uparrow.$$\nSecond, solvated electrons also effect deprotonation/reduction of ethanol to ethoxide with concomitant hydrogen evolution:\n$$2\\,e^{-}(\\text{am}) + 2\\,\\text{EtOH} \\to 2\\,\\text{EtO}^{-} + \\text{H}_{2}\\uparrow.$$\nThese reactions are highly exothermic, so the chemical hazard is immediate generation of large volumes of flammable $\\text{H}_{2}$.\n\nConcurrently, there is a severe physical hazard from heat transfer. The added ethanol is much warmer than liquid ammonia at its boiling point; introducing warm ethanol and releasing reaction heat into the cryogenic medium adds substantial heat to the system. Because the ammonia is at its normal boiling point, even modest heat input causes vigorous boiling. The combined heat from warm ethanol and the exothermic reactions drives rapid, violent boiling of liquid ammonia and vigorous refluxing/splashing of a strongly basic, caustic, reactive mixture out of an open-system flask.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because, although a flammable gas is produced, ethanol will not freeze at the temperature of boiling ammonia; the cracking mechanism described is incorrect.\n- B is incorrect because sodium amide is not formed explosively in this context, and nitrogen gas is not produced by sodium reacting with ammonia under these conditions.\n- C correctly identifies both the chemical hazard (highly exothermic formation of sodium ethoxide with rapid $\\text{H}_{2}$ evolution) and the physical hazard (violent boiling and splashing of liquid ammonia upon addition of warm ethanol).\n- D is incorrect because sodium and ethanol do not form sodium hydride; they form sodium ethoxide and $\\text{H}_{2}$. Ammonia does not rapidly decompose to nitrogen and hydrogen under these conditions.\n- E is incorrect because the dominant reaction is hydrogen evolution, not ethylene formation, and liquid ammonia boils rather than sublimates.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the dual, immediate risk is choice C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2181858"}, {"introduction": "A reaction that is well-behaved on a small scale can become dangerously uncontrollable when scaled up.

For the initial small-scale trial, the reaction is conducted in a small, spherical glass flask immersed in an ice-water bath maintained at a constant temperature, $T_{bath}$. The reaction is controlled by the slow addition of one reagent, leading to a steady rate of heat generation per unit volume, denoted by $q$. At this scale, the reaction mixture's temperature stabilizes at a steady-state value, $T_1$, which is slightly elevated above $T_{bath}$. The rate of heat dissipation from the flask to the bath is governed by Newton's law of cooling, $\\dot{Q}_{diss} = hA(T_{rxn} - T_{bath})$, where $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, $A$ is the surface area of the flask through which heat is transferred, and $T_{rxn}$ is the temperature of the reaction mixture.\n\nFollowing the success of the small-scale trial, the student is instructed to scale up the synthesis by a factor of $k = 100$. This involves using 100 times the quantity of each reagent.
