After satisfying the octet rule, one of the most important principles is to place formal charges on the atoms best equipped to stabilize them. This first practice provides a classic scenario: comparing two resonance structures of an anion to determine which is more stable based on which atom, carbon or nitrogen, bears the negative charge, a decision governed by electronegativity. [@problem_id:2197949]", "problem": "Consider the acetonitrile molecule, which has the chemical formula $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CN}$. When acetonitrile is treated with a strong base, a proton is removed from the methyl group, forming the acetonitrile carbanion, $[\\text{CH}_2\\text{CN}]^{-}$. This carbanion is stabilized by resonance. Two major resonance contributors for this anion are described below:\n\n- **Contributor A**: A structure featuring a carbon-carbon double bond, a carbon-nitrogen double bond, and a formal negative charge localized on the nitrogen atom.\n- **Contributor B**: A structure featuring a carbon-carbon single bond, a carbon-nitrogen triple bond, and a formal negative charge localized on the carbon atom adjacent to the nitrile group.\n\nRank these two resonance contributors in order of decreasing stability (from most stable to least stable).\n\nA. A > B\nB. B > A\nC. A and B are equally stable\nD. Neither structure represents a valid resonance contributor for the acetonitrile carbanion.", "solution": "To determine the relative stability of the resonance contributors for the acetonitrile carbanion, $[\\text{CH}_2\\text{CN}]^{-}$, we must apply the established rules for assessing resonance structure stability. The two contributors can be drawn as follows:\n\nContributor A: $[\\text{H}_2\\text{C}=\\text{C}=\\text{N}:]^−$\nContributor B: $[:\\text{CH}_2-\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{N}]^−$\n\nWe will evaluate them based on the following criteria, in order of priority:\n1.  **Octet Rule:** The most significant contributors are those in which all second-row atoms have a complete octet of valence electrons.\n2.  **Formal Charge Minimization:** Structures with the fewest formal charges are more stable.\n3.  **Placement of Negative Charge:** For contributors with equal numbers of formal charges, the most stable one places the negative charge on the most electronegative atom and the positive charge on the most electropositive atom.\n\nLet's analyze each contributor:\n\n**Step 1: Check the Octet Rule**\n-   For **Contributor A** ($[\\text{H}_2\\text{C}=\\text{C}=\\text{N}:]^-$), the leftmost carbon is double-bonded to the central carbon and single-bonded to two hydrogens, giving it 8 valence electrons. The central carbon has two double bonds, giving it 8 valence electrons. The nitrogen atom has a double bond (contributing 4 electrons) and two lone pairs (contributing 4 electrons), for a total of 8 valence electrons. Therefore, all second-row atoms in Contributor A have a complete octet.\n-   For **Contributor B** ($[:\\text{CH}_2-\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{N}]^−$), the leftmost carbon has three single bonds (contributing 6 electrons) and one lone pair (contributing 2 electrons), for a total of 8 valence electrons. The central carbon is part of a triple bond and a single bond, giving it 8 valence electrons. The nitrogen atom has a triple bond (contributing 6 electrons) and one lone pair (contributing 2 electrons), for a total of 8 valence electrons. Therefore, all second-row atoms in Contributor B also have a complete octet.\nSince both structures satisfy the octet rule for all relevant atoms, this rule does not help us distinguish their stabilities.\n\n**Step 2: Check Formal Charges**\nBoth contributors have an overall charge of -1.\n-   In **Contributor A**, the formal charge is located on the nitrogen atom.\n-   In **Contributor B**, the formal charge is located on the carbon atom.\nIn both cases, there is only one atom with a non-zero formal charge, and that charge is -1. Thus, this rule also does not differentiate between the two contributors.\n\n**Step 3: Placement of Negative Charge**\nThis is the deciding factor. We must compare the electronegativity of the atom bearing the negative charge in each contributor.\n-   In **Contributor A**, the negative charge is on a nitrogen atom.\n-   In **Contributor B**, the negative charge is on a carbon atom.\n\nNitrogen is more electronegative than carbon (approximately 3.04 vs. 2.55 on the Pauling scale). A more electronegative atom is better able to stabilize a negative charge. Therefore, the structure that places the negative charge on the nitrogen atom is more stable than the one that places it on the carbon atom.\n\n**Conclusion**\nContributor A is more stable than Contributor B because the negative charge resides on the more electronegative nitrogen atom. This makes Contributor A the major resonance contributor and Contributor B the minor one. The stability ranking is A > B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2197949"}, {"introduction": "While rules about formal charge are fundamental, they are not absolute and can be overshadowed by more powerful electronic effects. This problem introduces the critical concept of aromaticity, which provides profound stabilization, and its opposite, anti-aromaticity, which is profoundly destabilizing. By analyzing a hypothetical zwitterionic contributor of fulvene, you will learn to recognize how these powerful principles can dictate the stability of a resonance structure, often superseding simpler considerations. [@problem_id:2197994]", "problem": "Fulvene, an isomer of benzene with the chemical formula $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_6$, is a non-aromatic hydrocarbon. Its structure consists of a five-membered ring containing two conjugated double bonds, with a third double bond outside the ring (an exocyclic double bond). One can draw a resonance contributor for fulvene where the pi electrons from the exocyclic double bond are moved onto the exocyclic carbon atom, and the pi electrons from one of the ring double bonds are moved to form a new double bond in the ring. This process creates a zwitterionic species with a negative formal charge on the exocyclic carbon and a positive formal charge on a carbon atom within the five-membered ring, which now exists as a cyclopentadienyl cation system.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary reason why this zwitterionic resonance contributor is a very minor contributor to the overall resonance hybrid of fulvene and is considered highly unstable?\n\nA. The five-membered ring in the zwitterionic contributor is an anti-aromatic, 4π-electron system, which is exceptionally destabilizing.\nB. The contributor is unstable because it involves the separation of positive and negative charges, which is energetically unfavorable compared to the neutral structure.\nC. The contributor is unstable because the positively charged carbon atom within the five-membered ring does not have a complete octet of valence electrons.\nD. The contributor is unstable because the resulting five-membered ring is non-aromatic, and therefore lacks the special stabilization associated with aromaticity.\nE. The contributor is unstable because a negative charge is placed on a carbon atom, which is not highly electronegative.", "solution": "We identify the key electronic change in the specified resonance contributor: the exocyclic double bond donates its $\\pi$ electrons to the exocyclic carbon, generating a carbanion, while a ring $\\pi$ bond shifts to give a cyclopentadienyl cation within the five-membered ring.

This practice challenges you to connect the stability of a conjugate base—an enolate anion—to the acidity of its parent ketone.

Thus, to rank $H_{A}$, $H_{B}$, and $H_{C}$ by acidity, we compare the extent of resonance stabilization available to their conjugate bases and whether the molecular geometry permits effective $\\pi$-overlap between the alpha-carbon $p$ orbital and the carbonyl $\\pi^{*}$ orbital.\n\nFor $H_{A}$ (cyclopentanone), deprotonation at the alpha carbon yields a typical ketone enolate. The alpha carbon can adopt $sp^{2}$ hybridization and align its $p$ orbital parallel to the carbonyl $p$ orbitals, enabling effective $\\pi$-conjugation. This provides strong resonance stabilization of the conjugate base, so the alpha proton is relatively acidic.\n\nFor $H_{C}$ (bridgehead alpha proton at C1 of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one), deprotonation would require the bridgehead alpha carbon to adopt $sp^{2}$ hybridization and provide a $p$ orbital aligned for conjugation with the carbonyl. However, in a small bicyclic system such as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, the bridgehead position cannot attain the necessary planarity to support a double bond or a properly aligned $p$ orbital, consistent with the geometric constraint underlying Bredt’s rule. Consequently, the would-be enolate at the bridgehead lacks effective resonance delocalization into the carbonyl; the resulting conjugate base is essentially a localized carbanion with minimal stabilization. Therefore, $H_{C}$ is the least acidic of the three.\n\nFor $H_{B}$ (non-bridgehead alpha proton at C3 of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one), deprotonation occurs at a position that is not a bridgehead. The alpha carbon can more readily achieve $sp^{2}$ character and develop a $p$ orbital that overlaps with the carbonyl $\\pi$ system. Thus, an enolate-like resonance stabilization is possible. Nevertheless, the rigid bicyclic framework imposes geometric constraints that reduce the degree of optimal $\\pi$-overlap compared to a flexible monocyclic ketone. As a result, the resonance stabilization in the conjugate base of $H_{B}$, though present, is weaker than in cyclopentanone.\n\nCombining these arguments:\n1. $H_{A}$ has a conjugate base with full enolate resonance stabilization and favorable geometry.\n2. $H_{B}$ has some enolate resonance stabilization but diminished by geometric constraints.\n3. $H_{C}$ cannot achieve the required geometry for resonance delocalization; its conjugate base is least stabilized.\n\nTherefore, the acidity order is\n$$H_{A} > H_{B} > H_{C}.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2198011"}]}
