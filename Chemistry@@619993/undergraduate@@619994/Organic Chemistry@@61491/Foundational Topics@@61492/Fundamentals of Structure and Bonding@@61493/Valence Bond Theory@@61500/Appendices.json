To understand the reactivity and structure of this intermediate species, it is essential to describe its bonding using Valence Bond Theory.\n\nGiven that the atomic number of Aluminum (Al) is 13 and the atomic number of Chlorine (Cl) is 17, determine the hybridization scheme adopted by the central aluminum atom in the tetrachloroaluminate ion, $\\text{AlCl}_4^-$.\n\nA) $sp$\n\nB) $sp^2$\n\nC) $sp^3$\n\nD) $sp^3d$\n\nE) $sp^3d^2$\n\nF) $dsp^2$", "solution": "We analyze the bonding and hybridization at the central aluminum in the tetrachloroaluminate ion using valence bond theory and electron-domain counting.\n\nAluminum has the ground-state electronic configuration $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{1}$, so the valence shell is $3s^{2}3p^{1}$ with three valence electrons. In $\\text{AlCl}_{3}$, aluminum forms three $\\sigma$ bonds and has an empty valence orbital, making it a Lewis acid.

Valence bond theory correlates a steric number of four with the formation of four equivalent hybrid orbitals of $sp^{3}$ character. These four $sp^{3}$ hybrids on Al are oriented tetrahedrally and each overlaps with an appropriate orbital on a chlorine atom to form four Al–Cl $\\sigma$ bonds. Although one bond can be described as initially dative (from $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ to Al), once formed all four Al–Cl $\\sigma$ bonds are equivalent by symmetry, consistent with $sp^{3}$ hybridization and a tetrahedral geometry.

This exercise uses the ozone molecule, $\\text{O}_3$, to introduce the critical concept of resonance within Valence Bond Theory [@problem_id:2297858]. You will see how constructing a resonance hybrid is essential for accurately describing molecules with delocalized $\\pi$ electrons, reconciling theory with physical evidence.", "problem": "Experimental investigation of the ozone molecule, $\\text{O}_3$, reveals that it has a bent geometry with an O-O-O bond angle of approximately 117 degrees. Furthermore, both O-O bonds are found to be identical in length, measuring 127.8 picometers, a value that is intermediate between a typical O-O single bond (around 148 pm) and an O=O double bond (around 121 pm).\n\nYour task is to analyze the bonding in the ozone molecule using the framework of Valence Bond Theory (VBT). Based on this analysis, select the statement below that provides the most accurate and complete description of the bonding in ozone consistent with the provided experimental evidence.\n\nA. Ozone exists as a single, static structure with one covalent O-O single bond and one O=O double bond. The central oxygen atom is $sp^2$ hybridized, and the difference in bond lengths is averaged out over time due to molecular vibrations.\n\nB. The central oxygen atom is $sp$ hybridized, which would naturally lead to a linear molecule. According to Valence Bond Theory, the observed bent structure is an anomaly that the theory cannot explain, requiring more advanced models.\n\nC. To account for the equivalent bond lengths, Valence Bond Theory describes ozone as a resonance hybrid of two contributing Lewis structures. In this model, the central oxygen atom is $sp^2$ hybridized, using these orbitals to form a $\\sigma$ bond to each terminal oxygen and to hold a lone pair. The unhybridized $p$ orbital on the central atom participates in a delocalized $\\pi$ interaction that is represented by the superposition of the two resonance forms.\n\nD. The central oxygen atom is $sp^3$ hybridized, giving rise to a tetrahedral electronic geometry. Two positions are occupied by bonding pairs to the terminal oxygen atoms and two positions by lone pairs, resulting in a bent molecular shape. The equivalent bond lengths are explained by a single, delocalized bonding structure.\n\nE. The concept of localized bonds in Valence Bond Theory is inadequate for ozone. The equivalent bonds can only be explained by Molecular Orbital (MO) theory, which describes a delocalized 3-center, 4-electron $\\pi$ system arising from the combination of $p$ orbitals on all three oxygen atoms into bonding, non-bonding, and anti-bonding molecular orbitals.", "solution": "We begin from the experimental observations: ozone is bent with an O-O-O angle close to $117^{\\circ}$, and both O-O bonds are identical and intermediate in length between a typical single and a typical double bond. Under Valence Bond Theory (VBT), these features must be explained by the arrangement of electron domains around the central atom, the hybridization required for $\\sigma$ bonding and lone-pair accommodation, and the possibility of resonance to account for equivalence and delocalization.\n\nFirst, construct the plausible Lewis structures for $\\text{O}_{3}$. Each oxygen has $6$ valence electrons, so the total is $18$. Satisfying octets while connecting the three oxygens requires one $\\text{O=O}$ double bond and one $\\text{O-O}$ single bond at a time, with formal charges distributed as follows: the central oxygen carries a $+1$ formal charge, and the terminal oxygen attached by a single bond carries a $-1$ formal charge. There are two equivalent contributing structures, related by exchanging which terminal oxygen carries the double bond. VBT represents the actual molecule as a resonance hybrid (superposition) of these two structures.\n\nFrom this resonance description, each O-O bond in the hybrid has an average bond order equal to the mean of the two contributing bond orders:\n$$\nb=\\frac{1+2}{2}=\\frac{3}{2}.\n$$\nA bond order of $\\frac{3}{2}$ is consistent with the observed identical O-O bond lengths intermediate between a typical single and a typical double bond.\n\nNext, determine the hybridization and geometry at the central oxygen. In the dominant resonance picture, the central oxygen forms two $\\sigma$ bonds (one to each terminal oxygen) and holds one lone pair. This corresponds to three regions of electron density, which in VBT are accommodated by $sp^{2}$ hybridization. The three $sp^{2}$ orbitals lie in a plane oriented approximately trigonal planar; two are used to form $\\sigma$ bonds to the terminal oxygens, and one holds the lone pair. The remaining unhybridized $p$ orbital on the central oxygen is perpendicular to this plane and participates in $\\pi$ interaction with the appropriate $p$ orbitals on the terminal oxygens. In VBT, the $\\pi$ bonding is described via resonance between the two contributing structures; physically, this corresponds to delocalization of the $\\pi$ electrons over the three-atom framework. The trigonal planar electron-pair arrangement would give $120^{\\circ}$, and lone pair–bond pair repulsion decreases this to the observed value near $117^{\\circ}$, matching the data.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- Option A posits a single static structure with one single and one double bond and attributes equivalence to vibrational averaging. This does not account for truly identical bond lengths and contradicts the VBT resonance description; vibrational averaging does not produce exact equivalence in equilibrium bond lengths.\n- Option B proposes $sp$ hybridization and linearity, which contradicts the observed bent geometry and the clear $sp^{2}$ electron-domain count.\n- Option C states the VBT resonance hybrid picture with the central oxygen $sp^{2}$ hybridized, two $\\sigma$ bonds and one lone pair in $sp^{2}$ orbitals, and an unhybridized $p$ orbital engaged in a delocalized $\\pi$ interaction represented by two resonance forms. This matches the electron count, geometry, hybridization, bond order, and equal bond lengths.\n- Option D asserts $sp^{3}$ hybridization with two lone pairs on the central atom. That would imply four electron domains and a bent angle near $109.5^{\\circ}$ and contradicts the resonance-based electron counting (the central oxygen in the dominant Lewis structures has only one lone pair).\n- Option E claims VBT is inadequate and only MO theory explains equivalence. While MO theory indeed describes a $3$-center, $4$-electron $\\pi$ system, VBT with resonance already explains equivalent bond lengths and the geometry; thus VBT is adequate for the qualitative description requested.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete VBT description consistent with the experimental evidence is the resonance hybrid with a central $sp^{2}$-hybridized oxygen and delocalized $\\pi$ bonding represented by two equivalent resonance forms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2297858"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice explores a fascinating case where geometric constraints force a molecule to deviate significantly from ideal bond angles, leading to 'angle strain'.

This will lead you to the concept of 'bent bonds', providing a deeper insight into the source of reactivity in strained cyclic compounds.", "problem": "In organic chemistry, Valence Bond Theory is used to describe covalent bonding in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals. For a typical acyclic alkane like propane, carbon atoms are considered to be $sp^3$ hybridized, resulting in tetrahedral geometry with bond angles of approximately $109.5^\\circ$. However, in the cyclic alkane cyclopropane ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_6$), the three carbon atoms form an equilateral triangle, constraining the internal C-C-C bond angles to be exactly $60^\\circ$. This significant deviation from the ideal $sp^3$ angle leads to a phenomenon known as angle strain, making the molecule highly reactive.\n\nConsidering that each carbon atom in cyclopropane is bonded to two other carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the C-C sigma bonding in cyclopropane and the origin of its angle strain?\n\nA. The carbon atoms rehybridize to pure p-orbitals to form the C-C bonds, as three orthogonal p-orbitals can be arranged to create angles closer to $60^\\circ$ than $sp^3$ orbitals.\n\nB. To achieve the $60^\\circ$ bond angle, the carbon atoms adopt $sp^2$ hybridization for the ring bonds, creating a planar framework similar to benzene but with sigma bonds instead of pi bonds.\n\nC. The C-C sigma bonds are formed from the overlap of $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals, but these orbitals cannot point directly at each other. This poor, off-axis overlap results in weaker \"bent bonds\" where the electron density is maximized outside the internuclear axis.\n\nD. The angle strain in cyclopropane is a purely geometric concept and does not relate to orbital overlap; the C-C sigma bonds are identical in nature to those in a non-strained alkane, but are simply forced into a $60^\\circ$ configuration.\n\nE. The carbon atoms remain perfectly $sp^3$ hybridized with orbitals directed at $109.5^\\circ$, and the C-C bonds form by extreme bending of the orbitals themselves, not by changing the overlap geometry.", "solution": "In valence bond theory, a sigma bond between two atoms is strongest when the hybrid orbitals from each atom point directly along the internuclear axis, maximizing the overlap integral $S=\\int \\phi_{A}\\phi_{B}\\,d\\tau$. For a carbon with $sp^{3}$ hybridization, the four equivalent hybrids point toward the corners of a tetrahedron, with the ideal angle $\\theta_{\\text{tet}}$ between any pair given by $\\cos \\theta_{\\text{tet}}=-\\frac{1}{3}$, hence $\\theta_{\\text{tet}}\\approx 109.5^{\\circ}$. In a three-membered ring such as cyclopropane, the internal C-C-C angle is constrained to $60^{\\circ}$, so the directions of the two C-C bonds at each carbon are separated by $60^{\\circ}$—far from the tetrahedral value.\n\nBecause the adjacent carbons are fixed at $60^{\\circ}$, the $sp^{3}$ hybrids on neighboring carbons cannot point directly at each other along the C-C internuclear axis. Instead, each carbon uses hybrids that are oriented such that their larger lobes are directed outside the C-C internuclear line, leading to off-axis overlap. The resulting C-C sigma bonds are “bent” (banana bonds), with electron density concentrated outside the internuclear axis, above and below the ring plane. This off-axis geometry reduces the overlap integral $S$ relative to a standard head-on $sp^{3}$-$sp^{3}$ overlap, weakening the bonds and increasing the energy, which is the electronic origin of angle strain in cyclopropane.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is incorrect because adopting pure $p$ orbitals does not produce better alignment toward $60^{\\circ}$; three mutually orthogonal $p$ orbitals define $90^{\\circ}$ relationships and would not enhance sigma overlap in this geometry.\nB is incorrect because $sp^{2}$ hybridization implies trigonal planar geometry with $120^{\\circ}$ angles, not $60^{\\circ}$, and is inconsistent with the saturated nature of cyclopropane.\nD is incorrect because the nature of the sigma bonding changes: the overlap is off-axis and weaker compared to unstrained alkanes; angle strain is not purely geometric but directly reflects reduced orbital overlap and increased electronic energy.\nE is misleading because while the carbons are approximately $sp^{3}$, the key point is not “extreme bending of the orbitals themselves” in a way that preserves head-on overlap; rather, the bonds are formed by off-axis overlap of hybrids, i.e., bent (banana) bonds.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the C-C sigma bonds are formed from $sp^{3}$ hybrids that cannot point directly at each other, leading to poor, off-axis overlap and bent bonds with electron density outside the internuclear axis, which is the origin of the angle strain.
