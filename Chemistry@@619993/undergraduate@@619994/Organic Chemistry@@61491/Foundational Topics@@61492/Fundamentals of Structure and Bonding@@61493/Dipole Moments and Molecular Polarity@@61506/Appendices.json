The geometry around an $sp$-hybridized carbon is linear.\n    *   The terminal carbons ($C_1$ and $C_3$) are $sp^2$-hybridized. The geometry around an $sp^2$-hybridized carbon is trigonal planar.\n    *   The two pi bonds associated with the central carbon atom are formed from its two unhybridized p orbitals (let's say $p_y$ and $p_z$). The pi bond between $C_1$ and $C_2$ might use the $p_y$ orbital, while the pi bond between $C_2$ and $C_3$ must use the perpendicular $p_z$ orbital.

Choosing any other valid arrangement, such as Cl on $C_1$ in the +y direction and Cl on $C_3$ in the -z direction, will lead to the same conclusion about overall polarity.)\n\n3.  **Analysis of Bond Dipoles**: The polarity of the molecule is determined by the vector sum of its bond dipoles. The most significant bond dipoles are the C-Cl bonds, as chlorine is much more electronegative than carbon. The C-H bond dipoles are much smaller and can be considered for a more precise analysis, but the C-Cl dipoles are dominant.\n    *   The bond dipole for the $C_1$-Cl bond, $\\vec{\\mu}_1$, points from $C_1$ towards the Cl atom.

Since the vector sum of the bond dipoles is non-zero, the molecule has a net dipole moment and is therefore polar.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   A: Incorrect. The bond dipoles are not opposite in direction; they are approximately perpendicular. Therefore, they cannot cancel.\n    *   B: Correct. The perpendicular orientation of the two C-Cl bond dipoles ensures that their vector sum is non-zero, making the molecule polar.\n    *   C: Incorrect. While the carbon backbone is linear, the overall molecule is not linear or symmetric in a way that allows for dipole cancellation due to the perpendicular arrangement of the substituents.\n    *   D: Incorrect. This is an oversimplification. While C-Cl bonds are polar, their geometric arrangement can lead to a nonpolar molecule if they cancel, as in carbon tetrachloride ($\\text{CCl}_4$). Geometry is always critical.\n    *   E: Incorrect. An allene with this substitution pattern (A-CH=C=CH-A) does not possess a center of inversion. A center of inversion would require that for any atom at (x,y,z), an identical atom exists at (-x,-y,-z). This is not the case here.
