You will investigate a special case where the two interconverting chair conformations of a molecule are energetically identical, or degenerate [@problem_id:2162020]. This exercise trains you to move beyond simple calculations and develop a deeper spatial awareness, recognizing how molecular symmetry can lead to conformers with equal stability.", "problem": "Consider the molecule cis-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane. This molecule can exist in two distinct chair conformations which are interconvertible through a process known as a ring flip. In a chair conformation, each carbon atom has one axial bond (pointing vertically up or down, parallel to the principal axis of the ring) and one equatorial bond (pointing out to the side, away from the ring). A ring flip converts all axial bonds to equatorial bonds and vice versa.\n\nAnalyze the two chair conformations of cis-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane and select the statement that most accurately describes their relative stability.\n\nA. The conformation where one methyl group is axial and the other is equatorial is more stable than the conformation where both are equatorial.\n\nB. The two chair conformations have different potential energies, but they interconvert too rapidly to isolate a more stable form.\n\nC. The two chair conformations are degenerate, meaning they have exactly the same potential energy.\n\nD. The conformation with both methyl groups in equatorial positions is the most stable form.\n\nE. The conformation with both methyl groups in axial positions is the most stable form.", "solution": "We analyze the chair conformations of cis-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane using the axial/equatorial pattern and standard conformational energy principles.\n\nFirst, in any given chair, axial bonds alternate up and down around the ring. Labeling the carbons so that at carbon 1 the axial bond is up, then at carbon 4 the axial bond is down. The equatorial bond at carbon 1 is therefore oriented generally down, and at carbon 4 it is oriented generally up. For a cis-1,4-disubstitution (both substituents on the same side, either both up or both down), the only way to satisfy the cis requirement in a single chair is to place one substituent axial and the other equatorial: for example, at C1 axial up and at C4 equatorial up (both up), or at C1 equatorial down and at C4 axial down (both down). Therefore, in any one chair conformation of cis-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane, one methyl is axial and the other is equatorial; configurations with both equatorial or both axial would be trans, not cis, at the 1,4 positions and are therefore not allowed for the cis isomer.\n\nA ring flip interconverts axial and equatorial positions at every carbon while preserving the cis relationship. Consequently, after a ring flip, the methyl that was axial becomes equatorial and the one that was equatorial becomes axial. Thus, in both interconverting chairs, the substitution pattern is one axial methyl and one equatorial methyl.\n\nTo compare energies, use the standard conformational energy model where an axial substituent incurs an energy penalty equal to its A-value due to 1,3-diaxial interactions, whereas an equatorial substituent does not. Let $E_{0}$ be the baseline energy of the cyclohexane framework and $A_{\\mathrm{Me}}$ the A-value for a methyl group. For each chair conformation,\n$$\nE_{1}=E_{0}+A_{\\mathrm{Me}}, \\quad E_{2}=E_{0}+A_{\\mathrm{Me}}.\n$$\nBoth conformations contain exactly one axial methyl and therefore have identical energy penalties. There are no additional differentiating interactions between the two chairs because the ring environments at C1 and C4 are symmetry-related, so the sets of 1,3-diaxial interactions are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the two chair conformations of cis-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane are degenerate and have the same potential energy. Options asserting that both equatorial or both axial is most stable are not applicable to the cis isomer, and the option claiming different energies is incorrect.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that the two chair conformations are degenerate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2162020"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to synthesize multiple concepts and analyze a more complex system where simple steric rules are insufficient.
