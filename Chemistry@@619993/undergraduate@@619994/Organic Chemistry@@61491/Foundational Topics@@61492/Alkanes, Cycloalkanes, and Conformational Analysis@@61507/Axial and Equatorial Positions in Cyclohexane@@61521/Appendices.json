This foundational exercise challenges you to apply the rules of cyclohexane geometry to a 1,3-disubstituted system. By reasoning through the up/down orientation of axial and equatorial bonds at different positions, you will develop the crucial skill of predicting the conformational possibilities for a given stereoisomer, a cornerstone of conformational analysis [@problem_id:2156101].", "problem": "In the study of conformational isomers, the cyclohexane ring provides a foundational model. A six-membered ring like cyclohexane can rapidly interconvert between two stable chair conformations via a process known as a ring flip. Each substituent on the ring can occupy either an axial position (pointing vertically up or down, parallel to the ring's approximate threefold symmetry axis) or an equatorial position (pointing outwards from the perimeter of the ring).\n\nConsider the molecule *trans*-1,3-difluorocyclohexane. The prefix *trans* indicates that the two fluorine substituents are on opposite faces of the ring (one \"up\" and one \"down\" relative to the average plane of the ring), while the numbers 1 and 3 denote their positions on the carbon skeleton.\n\nBased on the principles of stereochemistry and conformational analysis, which of the following statements accurately describes the conformational possibilities for the two fluorine atoms in *trans*-1,3-difluorocyclohexane?\n\nA. In one chair conformation, both fluorine atoms are equatorial, and in the other, both are axial.\n\nB. In both possible chair conformations, one fluorine atom is axial and the other is equatorial.\n\nC. The molecule is conformationally locked, with one fluorine permanently axial and the other permanently equatorial.\n\nD. In one chair conformation, both fluorine atoms are axial, and in the other, they remain axial due to electronic effects.\n\nE. Both fluorine atoms can only occupy equatorial positions simultaneously to minimize steric strain.", "solution": "We analyze axial/equatorial orientation and up/down face at specific ring positions for a cyclohexane chair. In a standard chair, axial positions alternate up and down around the ring, with equatorial positions having the opposite up/down sense at the same carbon:\n$$\n\\text{At } i\\in\\{1,3,5\\}:\\ \\text{axial}=\\text{up},\\ \\text{equatorial}=\\text{down};\\quad\ni\\in\\{2,4,6\\}:\\ \\text{axial}=\\text{down},\\ \\text{equatorial}=\\text{up}.\n$$\nThe stereochemical descriptors relate to face as follows:\n$$\n\\text{cis}\\Longleftrightarrow\\text{both substituents on the same face (both up or both down)},\\quad\n\\text{trans}\\Longleftrightarrow\\text{opposite faces (one up, one down)}.\n$$\nFor a 1,3-disubstitution pattern, consider positions $1$ and $3$. Using the mapping above:\n- At C1: axial is up, equatorial is down.\n- At C3: axial is up, equatorial is down.\n\nTherefore:\n- Both axial (A/A) at C1 and C3 gives up at C1 and up at C3, hence same face, which is cis.\n- Both equatorial (E/E) at C1 and C3 gives down at C1 and down at C3, hence same face, which is cis.\n- One axial and one equatorial (A/E or E/A) at C1 and C3 gives one up and one down, hence opposite faces, which is trans.\n\nThus, for trans-1,3-disubstitution, in any given chair conformation one substituent must be axial and the other equatorial. Under a ring flip,\n$$\n\\text{ring flip}:\\ \\text{axial}\\leftrightarrow\\text{equatorial},\\quad \\text{up/down face is preserved},\n$$\nso the trans relationship persists while the axial/equatorial labels swap. Consequently, both possible chair conformations of trans-1,3-difluorocyclohexane have one fluorine axial and the other equatorial.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that in both possible chair conformations, one fluorine atom is axial and the other is equatorial.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2156101"}, {"introduction": "While a cyclohexane ring can interconvert between chair forms, the presence of substituents introduces energetic differences that favor one conformation over another. This practice moves beyond simple geometric possibilities to explore how steric strain dictates conformational preference [@problem_id:2156111]. By considering the sizable steric hindrance of a *tert*-butyl group, you will see how it can effectively \"lock\" the ring's conformation, a powerful concept for predicting the structure and reactivity of complex molecules.", "problem": "Consider the molecule *cis*-1-tert-butyl-3-methylcyclohexane. Cyclohexane and its derivatives can exist in various conformations, with the chair conformation being the most stable. In this conformation, substituents can occupy either axial positions (perpendicular to the general plane of the ring) or equatorial positions (in the general plane of the ring). The relative stability of different conformers is determined by the steric strain associated with the substituent positions.\n\nFor the single most stable chair conformer of *cis*-1-tert-butyl-3-methylcyclohexane, which of the following statements correctly describes the positions of the tert-butyl and methyl groups?\n\nA. The tert-butyl group is axial, and the methyl group is axial.\n\nB. The tert-butyl group is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n\nC. The tert-butyl group is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n\nD. The tert-butyl group is equatorial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n\nE. Both possible chair conformations are populated nearly equally, as they possess the same steric energy.", "solution": "We analyze conformational preferences in a cyclohexane chair using the following facts and logic.\n\nFirst, for disubstituted cyclohexanes in a fixed chair conformation, the relative stereochemistry determines the axial/equatorial pattern at given ring positions. For the 1,3-disubstitution pattern, cis means both substituents are on the same face (both up or both down). In a single chair, this corresponds to both substituents being either both axial or both equatorial. A chair flip converts all axial positions to equatorial and vice versa while preserving up/down configuration, so the two interconverting chair conformations of a cis-1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane are the AA (both axial) and EE (both equatorial) forms.\n\nSecond, substituents in axial positions experience 1,3-diaxial interactions that produce steric strain; this penalty increases with substituent size. Among common alkyl groups, a tert-butyl substituent has a very large axial penalty and overwhelmingly prefers to be equatorial, effectively locking the ring in the conformer that places it equatorial. A methyl group also prefers equatorial, but its penalty is much smaller than that of tert-butyl.\n\nApplying these principles to cis-1-tert-butyl-3-methylcyclohexane: the cis-1,3 relationship allows either AA or EE in a given chair. The AA conformer would place both tert-butyl and methyl axial, incurring a very large steric penalty, especially from the tert-butyl group. The EE conformer places both tert-butyl and methyl equatorial, minimizing 1,3-diaxial strain. Because the tert-butyl group so strongly disfavors an axial position, the EE conformer is the single most stable chair conformer. Therefore, in the most stable chair, the tert-butyl group is equatorial and the methyl group is equatorial.\n\nThis eliminates options that place the tert-butyl group axial (A, B), the mixed axial/equatorial arrangement (C) which is incompatible with the cis-1,3 pattern in a single chair, and the claim of equal populations (E), since the tert-butyl axial penalty makes AA vastly higher in energy than EE.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2156111"}, {"introduction": "In reality, conformational isomers exist in a dynamic equilibrium, with the population of each state determined by its relative free energy.
