In a full 360Â° rotation, the molecule passes through three identical low-energy staggered conformations and three identical high-energy eclipsed conformations.\n\nThe rotational energy barrier is defined as the energy difference between an eclipsed conformation (energy maximum) and a staggered conformation (energy minimum).
