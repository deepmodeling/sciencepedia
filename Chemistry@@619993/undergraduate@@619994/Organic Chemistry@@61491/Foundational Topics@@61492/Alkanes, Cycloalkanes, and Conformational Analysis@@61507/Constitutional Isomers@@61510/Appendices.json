These structural differences can lead to distinct physical and chemical properties. For instance, various acyclic (non-cyclic) alkanes with the molecular formula $C_6H_{14}$ are components of commercial gasoline, and their different branching structures influence properties like octane rating.\n\nConsidering only acyclic structures, how many distinct constitutional isomers exist for the molecular formula $C_6H_{14}$?", "solution": "An acyclic alkane’s carbon skeleton is a tree on carbon vertices, with no cycles and maximum vertex degree at most 4 (carbon valence). For $n=6$ carbons ($C_6H_{14}$), let $n_{k}$ denote the number of carbon atoms of carbon–carbon degree $k$ in the skeleton. For any tree on $n$ vertices, the number of edges is $E=n-1$ and the sum of degrees is $2E$.

View it as central with three branches of lengths $a,b,c\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 1}$ in edges, satisfying $a+b+c=5$ (since the total edges is $5$). Up to isomorphism, unordered partitions of $5$ into three positive parts are $3+1+1$ and $2+2+1$. Hence count $=2$.\n\n3) $(4,0,2,0)$: Two degree $3$ vertices and four leaves.
