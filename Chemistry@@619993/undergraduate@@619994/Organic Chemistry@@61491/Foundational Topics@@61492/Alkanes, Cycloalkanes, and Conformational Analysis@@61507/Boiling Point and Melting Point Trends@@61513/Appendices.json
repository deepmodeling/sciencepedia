To predict the order in which the compounds will be collected, the chemist must first arrange them by their boiling points.

The general order is\n$$\\text{hydrogen bonding} > \\text{dipole-dipole} > \\text{London dispersion}.$$\nAdditional hydrogen-bonding sites and larger molecular mass/surface area further increase the boiling point.\n\n- Compound I (butane) is a nonpolar alkane and exhibits only London dispersion forces. It thus has the lowest boiling point among the given compounds.\n- Compound III (methoxyethane) is an ether with a polar C–O bond. It exhibits dipole-dipole interactions in addition to London dispersion but lacks an O–H bond, so it cannot hydrogen-bond to itself. Its boiling point is higher than that of butane but lower than that of an alcohol of similar size.\n- Compound II (1-propanol) is an alcohol and can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This gives it a significantly higher boiling point than the ether and the alkane of similar size.\n- Compound IV (1,2-ethanediol) has two hydroxyl groups, allowing multiple hydrogen bonds per molecule and extensive hydrogen-bonding networks, as well as a larger molecular mass than the others. It therefore has the highest boiling point.\n\nThus, the order of increasing boiling point is I < III < II < IV, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205882"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, we now explore a classic paradox in physical organic chemistry that highlights the nuanced role of molecular shape. This problem [@problem_id:2177496] presents two isomers that have identical molecular formulas and only exhibit London dispersion forces, yet their boiling and melting points trend in opposite directions. By analyzing why a compact, spherical molecule boils lower but melts higher than its linear counterpart, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how surface area affects boiling while molecular symmetry governs melting.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with identifying two unlabeled liquid samples, designated Compound P and Compound Q. The student is informed that the samples are constitutional isomers with the molecular formula $C_5H_{12}$. One is n-pentane, and the other is 2,2-dimethylpropane, also known as neopentane. The student performs a careful measurement of their boiling points and melting points, obtaining the following data:\n\n*   **Compound P**: Boiling Point = 9.5 °C; Melting Point = -16.6 °C\n*   **Compound Q**: Boiling Point = 36.1 °C; Melting Point = -129.7 °C\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces and molecular structure, which of the following statements provides the most accurate identification of the compounds and the correct reasoning for the observed differences in both their boiling and melting points?\n\nA. Compound P is n-pentane and Compound Q is neopentane. The lower boiling point of n-pentane is due to its chain flexibility. The higher melting point of neopentane is due to its rigid, branched structure which promotes stronger intermolecular attractions in the solid state.\n\nB. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane arises because its compact, spherical shape reduces the available surface area for contact between molecules, leading to weaker London dispersion forces. Its higher melting point is a result of its high symmetry, which allows for very efficient packing into a crystal lattice, making the solid state unusually stable.\n\nC. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. Both the lower boiling point and the higher melting point of neopentane are a consequence of its compact shape leading to weaker intermolecular forces compared to n-pentane.\n\nD. Compound P is n-pentane and Compound Q is neopentane. The trends are reversed from what is expected; n-pentane's larger size should lead to a higher melting point, and neopentane's compact structure should lead to a higher boiling point due to density effects.\n\nE. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane is due to weaker London dispersion forces associated with its smaller surface area. Its higher melting point is due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions that are only present in the solid phase.", "solution": "The problem requires us to identify two isomers, n-pentane and neopentane, based on their given boiling and melting points, and to select the correct physical-chemical explanation for these properties.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecular structures.**\nBoth n-pentane and neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane) have the same molecular formula, $C_5H_{12}$. This means they have the same molar mass, and any differences in physical properties must arise from their different shapes.\n*   **n-pentane**: A straight-chain alkane, its molecule is long, linear, and flexible.\n*   **neopentane**: A branched-chain alkane, its molecule is highly compact and symmetrical, approaching a spherical shape.\n\nSince both molecules are nonpolar alkanes, the only intermolecular forces present are London dispersion forces (a type of van der Waals force).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the boiling point trend.**\nBoiling is the process of transitioning from the liquid phase to the gas phase. This requires overcoming the intermolecular forces holding the molecules together in the liquid. The strength of London dispersion forces depends on the polarizability of the electron cloud and the surface area available for intermolecular contact.\n*   n-pentane's long, chain-like shape provides a large surface area for contact with neighboring molecules. This allows for stronger, more extensive London dispersion forces.\n*   neopentane's compact, spherical shape minimizes its surface area. This reduces the area of contact between molecules, resulting in weaker London dispersion forces.\n\nTherefore, more energy is required to separate n-pentane molecules than neopentane molecules. This means n-pentane should have a higher boiling point than neopentane.\nComparing the data: Compound Q has a boiling point of 36.1 °C, while Compound P has a boiling point of 9.5 °C. Thus, **Compound Q must be n-pentane**, and **Compound P must be neopentane**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the melting point trend.**\nMelting is the process of transitioning from the ordered solid (crystal lattice) to the less-ordered liquid phase. The energy required, and thus the melting point, depends on two main factors: the strength of the intermolecular forces and the efficiency of packing in the crystal lattice.\n*   n-pentane, being a flexible and somewhat awkward shape, does not pack very efficiently into a crystal lattice. There are gaps and inefficiencies in the solid structure.\n*   neopentane, due to its high degree of symmetry (it's nearly spherical), can pack very neatly and efficiently into a crystal lattice, similar to the way marbles pack in a box. This efficient packing leads to a very stable and well-ordered solid structure.\n\nAlthough the individual intermolecular forces are weaker for neopentane, the energy required to break down its highly ordered and stable crystal lattice is significantly greater than the energy required to melt the less-efficiently packed n-pentane solid.\nTherefore, neopentane should have a higher melting point than n-pentane.\nComparing the data: Compound P has a melting point of -16.6 °C, while Compound Q has a melting point of -129.7 °C. The much higher melting point of Compound P confirms that it is neopentane, and the much lower melting point of Compound Q confirms it is n-pentane. This aligns with our conclusion from Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n*   **A**: Incorrectly identifies P as n-pentane and Q as neopentane.\n*   **B**: Correctly identifies P as neopentane and Q as n-pentane. It correctly explains the lower boiling point of neopentane as due to its smaller surface area and weaker London dispersion forces. It correctly explains the higher melting point of neopentane as due to its high symmetry allowing for efficient crystal lattice packing. This statement is entirely correct.\n*   **C**: Correctly identifies the compounds but provides an incorrect explanation for the melting point. Weaker forces alone would suggest a lower, not higher, melting point. It misses the crucial concept of packing efficiency.\n*   **D**: Incorrectly identifies the compounds and provides incorrect reasoning.\n*   **E**: Correctly identifies the compounds and the reason for the boiling point difference. However, it incorrectly attributes the melting point trend to dipole-dipole interactions, which do not exist in these nonpolar molecules.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, statement B is the only one that correctly identifies both compounds and provides the correct physical-chemical reasoning for both boiling point and melting point trends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2177496"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem challenges you to consider how the arrangement of functional groups within a single molecule can influence its interactions with other molecules. In this scenario [@problem_id:2156769], you will compare isomers that can all form strong hydrogen bonds, but the proximity of the hydroxyl groups creates a crucial difference. This exercise demonstrates the key concept of intramolecular versus intermolecular hydrogen bonding, explaining why some molecules effectively self-interact at the expense of forming a strong intermolecular network, leading to a lower boiling point.", "problem": "In the synthesis of polyesters, various diol monomers are used as building blocks. The physical properties of these monomers, such as boiling point, are critical for process design, purification, and storage. Consider the following three constitutional isomers of butanediol, which are all colorless, viscous liquids at room temperature:\n\n- Compound I: 1,2-butanediol\n- Compound II: 1,3-butanediol\n- Compound III: 1,4-butanediol\n\nBased on your understanding of molecular structure and intermolecular forces, predict the correct order of the boiling points for these three compounds, from lowest to highest.

All three isomers have approximately the same boiling point.", "solution": "We use the principle that, for constitutional isomers with the same molecular formula, differences in boiling points primarily reflect differences in the strength and extent of intermolecular forces. All three compounds can form hydrogen bonds; thus hydrogen bonding dominates over small differences in dispersion forces. The key factors are:\n- The number and accessibility of hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor sites for intermolecular association.\n- The possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which competes with and reduces intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n- Steric hindrance at the hydroxyl sites (primary versus secondary alcohol positions).\n\nAnalyze each structure:\n- Compound I (1,2-butanediol): The hydroxyl groups are vicinal, allowing a favorable five-membered intramolecular hydrogen bond. This intramolecular interaction reduces the number of hydrogen-bonding sites available for intermolecular association in the liquid. Additionally, one hydroxyl is on a secondary carbon, making it more sterically hindered than a primary hydroxyl. Net effect: the weakest overall intermolecular hydrogen-bond network among the three, leading to the lowest boiling point.\n- Compound II (1,3-butanediol): The hydroxyl groups are separated by two carbons, making intramolecular hydrogen bonding possible only through a larger, less favorable ring. Consequently, intramolecular hydrogen bonding is significantly less competitive than in the 1,2 isomer, so more intermolecular hydrogen bonding occurs. However, one hydroxyl is still secondary, providing some steric hindrance. Net effect: stronger intermolecular association than I, but less than III; intermediate boiling point.\n- Compound III (1,4-butanediol): The hydroxyl groups are at the chain termini, both primary and minimally hindered, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding would require an unfavorable large ring. Therefore, both hydroxyl groups effectively participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, maximizing the hydrogen-bond network. Net effect: the strongest intermolecular association among the three, leading to the highest boiling point.\n\nTherefore, the boiling points increase in the order I < II < III.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2156769"}]}
