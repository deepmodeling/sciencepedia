Among common intermolecular interactions, London dispersion is the weakest, and for molecules of comparable size, these forces are relatively small.\n- Acetaldehyde, $CH_3CHO$, possesses a polar carbonyl group. In the pure liquid it exhibits permanent dipole-dipole interactions in addition to London dispersion. It lacks an $O\\text{-}H$ or $N\\text{-}H$ bond, so it cannot donate hydrogen bonds to itself in the pure liquid; thus hydrogen bonding is not a dominant self-interaction for acetaldehyde.\n- Acetic acid, $CH_3COOH$, contains both a carbonyl and an $O\\text{-}H$ group.

Each molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, with each carbon bearing one hydrogen and one chlorine. Due to the double bond, rotation is restricted, giving rise to cis and trans isomers.\n\nPrinciple of molecular polarity: The $C–Cl$ bond is polar because chlorine is more electronegative than carbon, so each $C–Cl$ bond has a bond dipole pointing toward chlorine. The molecular dipole moment is the vector sum of all bond dipoles.\n\nIn cis-1,2-dichloroethene, the two chlorine atoms are on the same side of the double bond. The corresponding $C–Cl$ bond dipoles have components that add rather than cancel. Therefore, the molecule has a nonzero net dipole moment, $\\mu \\neq 0$.\n\nIn trans-1,2-dichloroethene, the two chlorine atoms are on opposite sides of the double bond. The $C–Cl$ bond dipoles are oriented so that, by symmetry, their vector sum approximately cancels, giving $\\mu \\approx 0$.\n\nIntermolecular forces and boiling point rationale: Boiling point correlates with the strength of intermolecular attractions. All molecules exhibit London dispersion forces, whose magnitude scales mainly with polarizability and surface area and are similar for these two isomers because they have the same molecular formula and comparable size. However, a permanent molecular dipole enables additional dipole-dipole interactions. Thus:\n- cis-1,2-dichloroethene (polar, $\\mu \\neq 0$) experiences both London dispersion and dipole-dipole interactions.\n- trans-1,2-dichloroethene (approximately nonpolar, $\\mu \\approx 0$) primarily experiences London dispersion forces.\n\nTherefore, cis-1,2-dichloroethene has the higher boiling point due to the presence of dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nRejection of alternatives:\n- Hydrogen bonding requires an H bonded to N, O, or F; there is no $N–H$, $O–H$, or $F–H$ bond here, so hydrogen bonding does not occur, invalidating the hydrogen-bond explanation.\n- Symmetry-driven packing is more relevant to melting points and does not outweigh the absence of dipole-dipole interactions for boiling points; the key difference remains polarity.\n- Having the same molecular formula does not imply identical intermolecular forces; geometry-induced polarity differences change boiling points.\n\nHence the correct statement is that cis-1,2-dichloroethene has the higher boiling point because its net dipole moment leads to dipole-dipole interactions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2177500"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise presents a fascinating paradox that reveals the subtleties of intermolecular forces.

[@problem_id:2177496]", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with identifying two unlabeled liquid samples, designated Compound P and Compound Q. The student is informed that the samples are constitutional isomers with the molecular formula $C_5H_{12}$. One is n-pentane, and the other is 2,2-dimethylpropane, also known as neopentane. The student performs a careful measurement of their boiling points and melting points, obtaining the following data:\n\n*   **Compound P**: Boiling Point = 9.5 °C; Melting Point = -16.6 °C\n*   **Compound Q**: Boiling Point = 36.1 °C; Melting Point = -129.7 °C\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces and molecular structure, which of the following statements provides the most accurate identification of the compounds and the correct reasoning for the observed differences in both their boiling and melting points?\n\nA. Compound P is n-pentane and Compound Q is neopentane. The lower boiling point of n-pentane is due to its chain flexibility. The higher melting point of neopentane is due to its rigid, branched structure which promotes stronger intermolecular attractions in the solid state.\n\nB. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane arises because its compact, spherical shape reduces the available surface area for contact between molecules, leading to weaker London dispersion forces. Its higher melting point is a result of its high symmetry, which allows for very efficient packing into a crystal lattice, making the solid state unusually stable.\n\nC. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. Both the lower boiling point and the higher melting point of neopentane are a consequence of its compact shape leading to weaker intermolecular forces compared to n-pentane.\n\nD. Compound P is n-pentane and Compound Q is neopentane. The trends are reversed from what is expected; n-pentane's larger size should lead to a higher melting point, and neopentane's compact structure should lead to a higher boiling point due to density effects.\n\nE. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane is due to weaker London dispersion forces associated with its smaller surface area. Its higher melting point is due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions that are only present in the solid phase.", "solution": "The problem requires us to identify two isomers, n-pentane and neopentane, based on their given boiling and melting points, and to select the correct physical-chemical explanation for these properties.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecular structures.**\nBoth n-pentane and neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane) have the same molecular formula, $C_5H_{12}$. This means they have the same molar mass, and any differences in physical properties must arise from their different shapes.\n*   **n-pentane**: A straight-chain alkane, its molecule is long, linear, and flexible.\n*   **neopentane**: A branched-chain alkane, its molecule is highly compact and symmetrical, approaching a spherical shape.\n\nSince both molecules are nonpolar alkanes, the only intermolecular forces present are London dispersion forces (a type of van der Waals force).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the boiling point trend.**\nBoiling is the process of transitioning from the liquid phase to the gas phase. This requires overcoming the intermolecular forces holding the molecules together in the liquid. The strength of London dispersion forces depends on the polarizability of the electron cloud and the surface area available for intermolecular contact.\n*   n-pentane's long, chain-like shape provides a large surface area for contact with neighboring molecules. This allows for stronger, more extensive London dispersion forces.\n*   neopentane's compact, spherical shape minimizes its surface area. This reduces the area of contact between molecules, resulting in weaker London dispersion forces.\n\nTherefore, more energy is required to separate n-pentane molecules than neopentane molecules. This means n-pentane should have a higher boiling point than neopentane.\nComparing the data: Compound Q has a boiling point of 36.1 °C, while Compound P has a boiling point of 9.5 °C. Thus, **Compound Q must be n-pentane**, and **Compound P must be neopentane**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the melting point trend.**\nMelting is the process of transitioning from the ordered solid (crystal lattice) to the less-ordered liquid phase. The energy required, and thus the melting point, depends on two main factors: the strength of the intermolecular forces and the efficiency of packing in the crystal lattice.\n*   n-pentane, being a flexible and somewhat awkward shape, does not pack very efficiently into a crystal lattice. There are gaps and inefficiencies in the solid structure.\n*   neopentane, due to its high degree of symmetry (it's nearly spherical), can pack very neatly and efficiently into a crystal lattice, similar to the way marbles pack in a box. This efficient packing leads to a very stable and well-ordered solid structure.\n\nAlthough the individual intermolecular forces are weaker for neopentane, the energy required to break down its highly ordered and stable crystal lattice is significantly greater than the energy required to melt the less-efficiently packed n-pentane solid.\nTherefore, neopentane should have a higher melting point than n-pentane.\nComparing the data: Compound P has a melting point of -16.6 °C, while Compound Q has a melting point of -129.7 °C. The much higher melting point of Compound P confirms that it is neopentane, and the much lower melting point of Compound Q confirms it is n-pentane. This aligns with our conclusion from Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n*   **A**: Incorrectly identifies P as n-pentane and Q as neopentane.\n*   **B**: Correctly identifies P as neopentane and Q as n-pentane. It correctly explains the lower boiling point of neopentane as due to its smaller surface area and weaker London dispersion forces. It correctly explains the higher melting point of neopentane as due to its high symmetry allowing for efficient crystal lattice packing. This statement is entirely correct.\n*   **C**: Correctly identifies the compounds but provides an incorrect explanation for the melting point. Weaker forces alone would suggest a lower, not higher, melting point. It misses the crucial concept of packing efficiency.\n*   **D**: Incorrectly identifies the compounds and provides incorrect reasoning.\n*   **E**: Correctly identifies the compounds and the reason for the boiling point difference. However, it incorrectly attributes the melting point trend to dipole-dipole interactions, which do not exist in these nonpolar molecules.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, statement B is the only one that correctly identifies both compounds and provides the correct physical-chemical reasoning for both boiling point and melting point trends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2177496"}]}
