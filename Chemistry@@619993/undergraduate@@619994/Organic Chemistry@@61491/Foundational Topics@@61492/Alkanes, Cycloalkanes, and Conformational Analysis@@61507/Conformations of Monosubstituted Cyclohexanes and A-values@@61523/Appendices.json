A larger A-value signifies a greater energetic penalty for the axial orientation and thus a stronger preference for the equatorial position.\n\nConsider two substituents: the methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$) and the trifluoromethyl group ($-\\text{CF}_3$). The key bond lengths to consider are C-H (~1.09 Å), C-F (~1.35 Å), and the C-C single bond in ethane (~1.53 Å).
