This first exercise challenges you to practice a fundamental skill in organic chemistry: generating and naming all constitutional isomers for a given formula that fit a specific structural class. By systematically identifying all the cycloalkanes that share this formula, you will develop a crucial intuition for the relationship between molecular composition, connectivity, and nomenclature [@problem_id:2178055].", "problem": "A substance is known to have the molecular formula $\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_{10}$.

A saturated five-membered ring has $n=5$, so $C_{5}H_{2 \\cdot 5}=C_{5}H_{10}$. It is cyclic. Accept.\n\nOption B: 1-Pentene. This is acyclic with one double bond; although $C_{5}H_{10}$ matches $C_{n}H_{2n}$, it is not cyclic. Reject.\n\nOption C: Methylcyclobutane. Start from cyclobutane $C_{4}H_{8}$. Replacing one ring hydrogen by a methyl group adds net $C_{1}H_{2}$ (since $C_{4}H_{8}-H + CH_{3}=C_{5}H_{10}$), giving $C_{5}H_{10}$. It is cyclic. Accept.\n\nOption D: Ethylcyclopropane. Start from cyclopropane $C_{3}H_{6}$. Replacing one ring hydrogen by an ethyl group gives $C_{3}H_{6}-H + C_{2}H_{5}=C_{5}H_{10}$. It is cyclic. Accept.\n\nOption E: 1,1-Dimethylcyclopropane.

Molecules with the same atomic connections can still be distinct from one another based on how their atoms are arranged in space; these are known as stereoisomers.

This broad category is divided into constitutional isomers, which have different atomic connectivity, and stereoisomers, which have the same connectivity but differ in the spatial orientation of their atoms.\n\nConsider a reference molecule, designated as Compound R, which has the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name *cis*-1-ethyl-2-methylcyclopropane.

Constitutional isomers have different atomic connectivity, whereas stereoisomers have the same connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement (e.g., cis/trans on rings). Compound R is cis-1-ethyl-2-methylcyclopropane, which is a 1,2-disubstituted cyclopropane with an ethyl group at carbon 1 and a methyl group at carbon 2 on the same face of the ring (cis). A stereoisomer of R must therefore have the same connectivity (ethyl at C1 and methyl at C2) but a different spatial relationship (not cis).\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- Option A: trans-1-ethyl-2-methylcyclopropane has the same connectivity (ethyl at C1, methyl at C2) but opposite relative orientation (trans instead of cis). This is a stereoisomer (specifically a diastereomer) of R and is not identical to it.\n- Option B: 1-ethyl-1-methylcyclopropane places both substituents on the same carbon; this changes connectivity relative to R, making it a constitutional isomer, not a stereoisomer.\n- Option C: Propylcyclopropane has a single propyl substituent on the cyclopropane ring; this changes connectivity and substitution pattern, so it is a constitutional isomer, not a stereoisomer of R.\n- Option D: Cyclohexane has a different molecular formula and connectivity; it is not an isomer of R.\n- Option E: 1,1-Dimethylcyclobutane has a different ring size and connectivity; at best it could be a constitutional isomer with the same formula, but it is not a stereoisomer.\n\nThus, the only stereoisomer of Compound R listed, not identical to it, is the trans diastereomer in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2178021"}, {"introduction": "Organic molecules are not static entities but are in constant motion, adopting various shapes or \"conformations.\" Understanding the most stable conformation is key to predicting a molecule's properties and reactivity. This final practice [@problem_id:2178024] invites you to analyze the dynamic behavior of substituted cyclohexanes through a thought experiment involving a \"chair flip.\" By evaluating the stability of different arrangements of substituents in *trans*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, you'll connect the concepts of stereochemistry and conformational energy to make predictions about molecular structure.", "problem": "A student is studying the conformational analysis of substituted cycloalkanes. They are specifically investigating the molecule *trans*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.

The claim is correct. The conformation with both chlorine atoms in equatorial positions exists and is the more stable of the two possible chair conformations.\n\nB. The claim is correct. The conformation with both chlorine atoms in equatorial positions exists but is the less stable of the two possible chair conformations.\n\nC. The claim is incorrect. For a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, the only possible chair conformations have one substituent in an axial position and the other in an equatorial position.\n\nD. The claim is incorrect. For *trans*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, the only possible chair conformation has both chlorine atoms in axial positions.\n\nE. The claim is incorrect. The two chair conformations are equivalent and degenerate in energy, so there is no preference for axial or equatorial placement.", "solution": "We analyze chair conformations of a $1,2$-disubstituted cyclohexane by tracking axial and equatorial orientations at adjacent carbons in a single chair.\n\n1. In any given chair, axial orientations alternate up and down around the ring. If we label carbon $1$ with axial up, then carbon $2$ has axial down, carbon $3$ axial up, and so on. On each carbon, the equatorial orientation is opposite in up/down sense to the axial on that same carbon. Thus, at carbon $1$ equatorial is down, and at carbon $2$ equatorial is up.\n\n2. For a $1,2$-disubstitution pattern, a trans relationship means one substituent is up and the other is down. Using the mapping above:\n   - If both substituents occupy equatorial positions at carbons $1$ and $2$, their orientations are down at carbon $1$ and up at carbon $2$, which is trans. Therefore, a diequatorial trans-$1,2$ conformation exists.\n   - The ring flip converts all axial positions to equatorial and all equatorial positions to axial at the same carbons. Thus, the diequatorial trans conformation interconverts to a diaxial trans conformation (up at carbon $1$, down at carbon $2$), which is also trans.\n\n3. Stability considerations: Axial substituents suffer $1,3$-diaxial interactions, increasing steric strain. For a substituent such as chlorine with a positive equatorial preference (nonzero A-value), the equatorial position is more stable than the axial position. Consequently, the conformation with both chlorines equatorial (diequatorial) is lower in energy than the conformation with both chlorines axial (diaxial).\n\nConclusion: The student’s claim that both chlorines can be equatorial in a chair conformation is correct, and that diequatorial conformation is the more stable of the two possible chair conformations.
