We are interested in the conformational isomerism resulting from rotation about the C1-C2 bond.

In this type of projection, the bond between the front and rear carbons is drawn diagonally and is viewed from a side-on perspective. The substituents on the front carbon are represented by three lines originating from the lower-left end of the diagonal bond, and the substituents on the rear carbon are represented by three lines originating from the upper-right end.

Its flexibility allows it to adopt various three-dimensional shapes, known as conformations, through rotation about the central carbon-carbon single bond. We will analyze the relative stabilities of three specific staggered conformations of this molecule. The conformations are defined by the dihedral angle between the two C-O bonds and the orientation of the hydroxyl hydrogens.\n\n- **Conformation I:** The anti-periplanar conformation, where the dihedral angle between the two C-O bonds is $180^\\circ$.\n- **Conformation II:** A syn-clinal (gauche) conformation where the dihedral angle between the two C-O bonds is $60^\\circ$. In this specific geometry, the hydroxyl hydrogen of one group is spatially proximate to the oxygen atom of the other group, allowing for the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond.\n- **Conformation III:** A syn-clinal (gauche) conformation, also with a C-O / C-O dihedral angle of $60^\\circ$. In this case, due to the orientation of the hydroxyl hydrogens, an intramolecular hydrogen bond is not possible.\n\nBased on the interplay of steric and electronic effects, rank these three conformations in order of decreasing stability (from most stable to least stable).\n\nA. I > II > III\nB. II > I > III\nC. III > I > II\nD. I > III > II\nE. II > III > I", "solution": "The task is to rank the stability of three conformations of 1,2-ethanediol. Stability is inversely related to potential energy; a more stable conformation has lower potential energy. The stability of a conformation is determined by a balance of several factors, primarily torsional strain, steric strain, and non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bonds. Since all three conformations described are staggered, their torsional strain is minimized and can be considered roughly equal. The main differences will arise from steric strain and hydrogen bonding.\n\nStep 1: Analyze Conformation I (Anti).\nThis conformation is anti-periplanar, meaning the two bulky hydroxyl (-OH) groups are positioned $180^\\circ$ apart from each other. This arrangement places the largest substituents as far away from each other as possible. Consequently, Conformation I experiences minimal steric strain (van der Waals repulsion) between the two -OH groups. However, the groups are too far apart to interact in any stabilizing way, such as through hydrogen bonding. Its energy level serves as a good reference point, primarily reflecting the baseline stability of a staggered ethanediol backbone.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Conformation III (Gauche, no H-bond).\nThis conformation is syn-clinal, or gauche, with the two -OH groups having a dihedral angle of $60^\\circ$. This proximity causes a gauche interaction, a form of steric strain, between the two bulky hydroxyl groups. This interaction is destabilizing, raising the potential energy of the molecule compared to the anti conformation (Conformation I). The problem statement specifies that in this particular rotamer, there is no possibility for an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Therefore, the net effect on stability for this conformation is purely destabilizing due to steric hindrance. Its energy is higher than that of Conformation I.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Conformation II (Gauche, with H-bond).\nLike Conformation III, Conformation II is also gauche, with the same $60^\\circ$ dihedral angle between the -OH groups. Therefore, it experiences the same amount of destabilizing steric strain from the gauche interaction. However, the key difference is that its specific geometry permits the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. A hydrogen bond is a strong, stabilizing non-covalent interaction where a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like the oxygen in an -OH group) is attracted to another nearby electronegative atom (the oxygen of the other -OH group). This stabilizing interaction significantly lowers the potential energy of the conformation. In the case of 1,2-ethanediol, the stabilization energy from the intramolecular hydrogen bond (approximately 8-12 kJ/mol) is greater than the destabilization energy from the gauche steric interaction (typically around 3-4 kJ/mol).\n\nStep 4: Compare the energies and rank stability.\nLet's summarize the energetic contributions for each conformation relative to a baseline.\n- **Conformation I (Anti):** Minimal steric strain. No significant stabilization. Let's set its energy as a reference, $E_I$.\n- **Conformation III (Gauche, no H-bond):** Contains a destabilizing gauche interaction ($E_{gauche}$). Its energy is $E_{III} = E_I + E_{gauche}$. Since $E_{gauche} > 0$, we have $E_{III} > E_I$.\n- **Conformation II (Gauche, with H-bond):** Contains the same destabilizing gauche interaction ($E_{gauche}$) but also a strong stabilizing hydrogen bond ($E_{H-bond}$). Its energy is $E_{II} = E_I + E_{gauche} - E_{H-bond}$. Since the magnitude of stabilization from the H-bond is greater than the destabilization from the gauche strain ($E_{H-bond} > E_{gauche}$), the net effect is a lowering of energy relative to the anti conformation, i.e., $E_{II}  E_I$.\n\nCombining these findings, we get the energy ordering: $E_{II}  E_I  E_{III}$.\nSince stability is inversely proportional to energy, the stability ranking (from most stable to least stable) is: Conformation II > Conformation I > Conformation III.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2198298"}, {"introduction": "To move from qualitative descriptions of stability to precise, quantitative comparisons, chemists use A-values to assign an energetic cost to specific steric interactions.
