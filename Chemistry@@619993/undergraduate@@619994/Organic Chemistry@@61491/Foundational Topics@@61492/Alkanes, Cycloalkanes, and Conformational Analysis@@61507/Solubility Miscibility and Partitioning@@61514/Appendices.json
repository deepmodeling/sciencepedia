By analyzing solubility data and physical properties, you will learn to diagnose the cause of this issue and apply the principles of solubility to select an appropriate solvent, a critical diagnostic skill for any practicing chemist.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher has synthesized a new compound, N-phenyl-2-cyanoacetamide, which is a white solid at room temperature with a sharp melting point of 95.0 °C. To purify the crude product, the researcher attempts a recrystallization. Following a literature precedent for a similar compound, the researcher chooses Toluene as the solvent. A quantity of the crude solid is dissolved in a minimum amount of boiling Toluene (Boiling Point = 111 °C) to form a clear, saturated solution. However, upon allowing the flask to cool, the researcher is surprised to observe the formation of a dense, immiscible oil at the bottom of the flask instead of the desired solid crystals. This phenomenon is known as \"oiling out.\"\n\nThe researcher compiles a table of solubility data for N-phenyl-2-cyanoacetamide in several potential solvents to diagnose the problem and find a suitable alternative.\n\n| Solvent | Boiling Point (°C) | Solubility at Boiling Point (g/100 mL) | Solubility at 0 °C (g/100 mL) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Toluene | 111 | 42.0 | 0.90 |\n| 95% Ethanol | 78.5 | 31.5 | 1.50 |\n| Water | 100 | 0.25 | 0.02 |\n| Dichloromethane | 39.6 | 55.0 | 28.0 |\n| Acetone | 56.0 | 48.0 | 2.50 |\n\nBased on the provided information, which of the following statements provides the most accurate diagnosis for why the compound oiled out in Toluene and proposes the best remedy?\n\nA. The compound is too soluble in Toluene, causing precipitation to occur too rapidly. The remedy is to cool the Toluene solution in an ice bath to force rapid crystallization.\n\nB. The boiling point of Toluene is higher than the melting point of the compound, causing the solute to separate as a molten liquid. The best remedy is to switch to Acetone as the solvent.\n\nC. The crude sample contains impurities that significantly depress its melting point. The best remedy is to first purify the compound by column chromatography before attempting recrystallization again in Toluene.\n\nD. The boiling point of Toluene is higher than the melting point of the compound, causing the solute to separate as a molten liquid. The best remedy is to switch to 95% Ethanol as the solvent.\n\nE. The compound's polarity is poorly matched with Toluene, leading to incomplete dissolution. The best remedy is to switch to Water, a highly polar solvent.", "solution": "Define the phenomenon: in recrystallization, if the solution becomes supersaturated at temperatures above the solute’s melting point, the solute can separate as a liquid phase rather than forming solid nuclei; this liquid phase appears as an immiscible oil (“oiling out”). A principal cause is using a solvent whose boiling point is higher than the solute’s melting point, so that during cooling the solution first reaches supersaturation while the temperature is still above the solute’s melting point, favoring liquid-phase separation.\n\nApply this to the given system: the compound has a sharp melting point near 95, while Toluene boils well above this temperature. Thus, when the hot saturated Toluene solution is cooled from its boiling point, it becomes supersaturated in a temperature range that is still above the compound’s melting point, favoring separation of a molten oil rather than crystalline nucleation. Therefore, the diagnosis that the solvent’s boiling point exceeds the solute’s melting point is correct; rapid cooling (as in option A) would typically aggravate oiling out, not cure it, and impurity-based melting point depression (option C) is not the primary cause given the clear match between boiling and melting temperatures.\n\nChoose the best remedy by solvent selection criteria: to avoid oiling out, select a solvent whose boiling point is below the solute’s melting point and which exhibits suitable hot-versus-cold solubility contrast for good recovery. From the table:\n- 95% Ethanol has a boiling point below the solute’s melting point and a favorable hot/cold solubility ratio with relatively lower cold solubility compared to Acetone, supporting higher recovery and good crystallization.\n- Acetone also has a boiling point below the solute’s melting point and an acceptable solubility contrast, but its cold solubility is higher than that in 95% Ethanol, implying greater loss to mother liquor.\n- Water is too poor a solvent at its boiling point to be practical, and Dichloromethane’s cold solubility is too high to permit crystallization.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate diagnosis is that Toluene’s boiling point exceeds the solute’s melting point, causing oiling out, and the best remedy from the provided options is to switch to 95% Ethanol for recrystallization.\n\nHence, option D is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2199834"}, {"introduction": "Liquid-liquid extraction is a powerful technique for isolating compounds, with applications ranging from drug discovery to environmental analysis.

The distribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the total concentration of the compound (all species, ionized and neutral) in the organic phase to its total concentration in the aqueous phase.\n\nFor the weak acid, Acidiphen (HA), the equilibrium in the aqueous phase is $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$.
