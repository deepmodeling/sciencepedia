However, the story becomes more dynamic when substituents are added to the ring. This first practice challenges you to connect a molecule's two-dimensional stereochemical label, such as *cis* or *trans*, with its three-dimensional conformational possibilities. By determining which stereoisomer of 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane can adopt a conformation with both chlorine atoms in the spacious equatorial positions, you will build a crucial conceptual foundation for predicting molecular shape and stability [@problem_id:2161744].", "problem": "In the study of conformational analysis, the stability of substituted cyclohexanes is a key concept. The most stable chair conformation of a substituted cyclohexane is typically the one that minimizes steric strain, particularly unfavorable 1,3-diaxial interactions where an axial substituent interacts with axial hydrogens on carbons three positions away. Consider the two stereoisomers of 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. One of these isomers is uniquely capable of undergoing a ring flip to adopt a chair conformation in which both chlorine substituents occupy equatorial positions, thereby completely avoiding any 1,3-diaxial interactions involving the chloro groups.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the isomer that can exist in a conformation with no axial substituents?\n\nA. cis-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane\n\nB. trans-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane\n\nC.

Neither cis-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane nor trans-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.", "solution": "Goal: Identify which 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane stereoisomer can adopt a chair conformation in which both chloro substituents are equatorial (hence no axial substituents and no 1,3-diaxial interactions).\n\nPrinciples used:\n- In a cyclohexane chair, each carbon bears one axial and one equatorial substituent. Axial positions alternate up and down around the ring; equatorial positions also alternate up and down.\n- Steric strain from 1,3-diaxial interactions occurs only for axial substituents; equatorial substituents avoid these interactions.\n- A ring flip interconverts axial and equatorial positions at each carbon while preserving the relative stereochemistry (cis or trans) between substituents.\n\nAnalysis for 1,2-disubstitution:\n- For substituents on adjacent carbons (1,2-relationship), the equatorial orientations on adjacent carbons are opposite in sense (one equatorial up, the next equatorial down). Therefore, a diequatorial 1,2-disubstitution must place one substituent up and the other down, which corresponds to a trans relationship.\n- Conversely, a cis-1,2 relationship (both substituents on the same face: both up or both down) cannot be achieved with both substituents equatorial on adjacent carbons, because adjacent equatorial positions are opposite in up/down sense. Thus, cis-1,2 in any chair conformation must have one substituent axial and the other equatorial; upon ring flip, they interconvert but remain one axial and one equatorial, never both equatorial.\n- For trans-1,2, one chair conformation allows both substituents to be equatorial (diequatorial, no axial substituents), while the ring-flipped chair makes both axial (diaxial).\n\nConclusion: Only trans-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane can adopt a chair conformation with both chloro substituents equatorial, eliminating all axial substituents and thus all 1,3-diaxial interactions involving the chloro groups.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2161744"}, {"introduction": "We know that placing a substituent in an equatorial position is generally more stable, but by how much?
