The most stable conformation of a cyclohexane ring is the chair conformation. For substituted cyclohexanes, the molecule can rapidly interconvert between two distinct chair conformations through a process known as a \"ring flip.\" The relative energies of these two conformations determine the equilibrium distribution.\n\nConsider the molecule *trans*-1,3-diethylcyclohexane. It exists as an equilibrium mixture of two different chair conformations. Your task is to analyze the energetic relationship between these two interconverting conformations.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between the two principal chair conformations of *trans*-1,3-diethylcyclohexane?\n\nA.

In a given chair, the total steric contribution from the ethyl substituents is the sum of one axial penalty and one equatorial baseline (taken as zero additional penalty).\n- Therefore, for either chair,\n$$\nE_{\\text{chair}} \\;=\\; E_{0} \\,+\\, A_{\\mathrm{Et}},\n$$\nwhere $E_{0}$ is the energy of the unsubstituted chair framework plus any contributions that do not change between the two conformers.\n- Because the two ethyl groups are identical and C1 and C3 are symmetry-equivalent positions in the cyclohexane framework, the conformer with the C1 ethyl axial and the conformer with the C3 ethyl axial have the same energy.\n\nConsequences for the options:\n- A: True. The two chair conformations are degenerate in energy, since each has exactly one axial ethyl incurring the same $A_{\\mathrm{Et}}$ penalty.\n- B: False. A chair with both ethyls axial would be cis-1,3, not trans-1,3, and is not accessible for the trans isomer.\n- C: False. A diequatorial arrangement corresponds to cis-1,3, not trans-1,3.\n- D: False. The system can undergo a ring flip; there is no conformational lock implied by ethyl substituents.\n- E: False.

The stability of a substituted cyclohexane conformer is influenced by the steric strain associated with its substituents. The primary source of this strain for a monosubstituted cyclohexane is the set of 1,3-diaxial interactions experienced by an axial substituent. The \"A-value\" for a substituent quantifies the Gibbs free energy cost of placing it in an axial position compared to an equatorial one.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, use the following A-values:\n*   For a tert-butyl group: $A_{\\text{t-Bu}} = 22.0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n*   For a chlorine atom: $A_{\\text{Cl}} = 2.5 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n\nDue to the extreme steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, its A-value is exceptionally large. Consequently, you can assume that for both the *cis* and *trans* isomers, the population of any chair conformer with an axial tert-butyl group is negligible. Therefore, the thermodynamic properties of each isomer are determined solely by the properties of its single most stable conformer (the one with an equatorial tert-butyl group). You may also neglect any other potential steric interactions, such as gauche interactions between the substituents.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the difference in standard Gibbs free energy between the most stable conformer of the *trans* isomer and the most stable conformer of the *cis* isomer.
