This exercise [@problem_id:2190050] delves into the competition between intramolecular and intermolecular forces. By examining two isomers of hydroxybenzoic acid, you will discover how an internal hydrogen bond can sequester functional groups, making them less available to interact with solvent molecules and thereby significantly impacting physical properties like solubility and melting point.", "problem": "Consider the two constitutional isomers, 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (commonly known as salicylic acid) and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Both molecules possess the same molecular formula ($C_{7}H_{6}O_{3}$) and contain a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group attached to a benzene ring. Despite these similarities, experimental measurements show that 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is significantly more soluble in water than 2-hydroxybenzoic acid.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this observed difference in water solubility?\n\nA. The symmetrical structure of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid allows it to pack more efficiently into a stable crystal lattice. This high lattice energy makes it more difficult to dissolve than 2-hydroxybenzoic acid.\n\nB. In 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, the hydroxyl group can form an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the adjacent carboxylic acid group. This internal bonding reduces the availability of these functional groups to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water, thus lowering its solubility.\n\nC. The 4-hydroxybenzoic acid isomer is a stronger acid than 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. This leads to a greater degree of ionization in water, and the resulting ionic species is more readily solvated, causing higher solubility.\n\nD. The overall molecular dipole moment of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is significantly larger than that of 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, leading to stronger dipole-dipole interactions with polar water molecules and thus greater solubility.", "solution": "Goal: Identify the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the higher water solubility of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid compared to 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid).\n\nPrinciple of solubility in polar protic solvents: For molecular solutes in water, solubility increases with the capacity of the solute to engage in strong, favorable solute-solvent interactions, especially hydrogen bonding and, when ionization occurs, ion-dipole interactions. Functional groups such as $-{\\rm OH}$ and $-{\\rm COOH}$ act as hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors with water. Any intramolecular interaction that sequesters these sites reduces their availability for intermolecular hydrogen bonding to water, lowering solubility.\n\nStructural analysis:\n- In 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, the $-{\\rm OH}$ group is ortho to the $-{\\rm COOH}$ group. The geometry allows a favorable six-membered intramolecular hydrogen bond from the phenolic $-{\\rm OH}$ (donor) to the carbonyl oxygen of the carboxylic acid (acceptor). This intramolecular hydrogen bond decreases the number of hydrogen bonding interactions the molecule can form with water, because the donor and acceptor sites are internally satisfied.\n- In 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, the $-{\\rm OH}$ and $-{\\rm COOH}$ groups are para to each other and too far apart to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Consequently, both the phenolic $-{\\rm OH}$ and the carbonyl/acidic sites remain fully available to form multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water, enhancing solubility.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option B: This precisely states the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding effect in 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, reducing its ability to hydrogen bond with water, and thus explains its lower solubility relative to the para isomer. This invokes the most direct and fundamental solvation principle: availability of hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors for interaction with the solvent.\n- Option A: It claims that the symmetry of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid leads to a more stable crystal lattice and higher lattice energy, making it more difficult to dissolve than the ortho isomer. This contradicts the observed higher solubility of the para isomer; moreover, even where lattice energy matters, the statement predicts the opposite trend and thus cannot be the explanation for higher solubility.\n- Option C: It asserts that 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is a stronger acid than 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. In fact, 2-hydroxybenzoic acid is typically the stronger acid, due to the ortho effect and stabilization (including intramolecular hydrogen bonding) of its conjugate base; therefore, this claim is false and cannot explain the observed solubility difference.\n- Option D: While dipole moments can influence solubility, the dominant and more fundamental factor here is hydrogen-bonding availability. Moreover, differences in dipole moment between these isomers do not systematically override the strong effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the ortho isomer. Thus, this is not the most accurate and fundamental explanation.\n\nConclusion: The observed higher solubility of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is best explained by the absence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which leaves its polar functional groups fully available for intermolecular hydrogen bonding with water, whereas 2-hydroxybenzoic acidâ€™s intramolecular hydrogen bond reduces such interactions.
