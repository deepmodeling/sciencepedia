This exercise challenges you to apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to a Fischer projection, a common task where small errors can lead to the wrong stereoisomer. By working through this problem, you will reinforce the critical procedure for assigning R/S configurations, especially the rule for when the lowest-priority group occupies a horizontal position in the projection [@problem_id:2170848].", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is tasked with drawing the Fischer projection for (2R, 3S)-2,3-dibromopentane. The student orients the carbon backbone vertically, with the methyl group (C1) at the top of the projection and the ethyl group (C5) at the bottom. In the student's final drawing, the substituents on carbon-2 are a hydrogen atom on the left and a bromine atom on the right. On carbon-3, the substituents are a bromine atom on the left and a hydrogen atom on the right.

Therefore, the sense observed in the 2D Fischer (clockwise or counterclockwise for $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$) must be inverted to obtain the actual $R/S$ configuration.\n\nTo determine clockwise versus counterclockwise in the 2D Fischer, assign the four positions coordinates\n$$U=(0,1),\\quad R=(1,0),\\quad D=(0,-1),\\quad L=(-1,0),$$\nand use the signed out-of-plane component of the cross product.

This practice explores the consequence of performing a \"forbidden\" operation—a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation in the plane of the paper. This thought experiment is particularly insightful when applied to a meso compound, revealing a fundamental connection between the rules of representation and the intrinsic symmetry of the molecule itself [@problem_id:2170889]. It provides a deeper understanding of why meso compounds are achiral, as their mirror image representation is identical to the original.", "problem": "Consider meso-tartaric acid, which has the chemical structure 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid. In a standard Fischer projection of this molecule (Structure A), the two carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups are placed on the vertical axis, with one at the top and one at the bottom.

Structure A has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (one is R and the other is S in standard assignments), and the molecule possesses an internal mirror plane, making it a meso compound and thus achiral. Therefore, its enantiomer is superimposable on itself.\n\nWhen Structure A is rotated by $90^{\\circ}$ to give Structure B, the operation corresponds to converting to the enantiomeric representation. However, because meso-tartaric acid is achiral (meso), the enantiomer is identical to the original molecule. Hence, Structure B and Structure A represent the same molecule.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemical relationship is that they are identical.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2170889"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify and draw individual stereoisomers, a more advanced challenge is to determine the total number of unique stereoisomers that can exist for a given molecular structure.

This problem requires you to analyze a symmetrical molecule and systematically calculate the true number of distinct stereoisomers, including both chiral enantiomeric pairs and achiral meso forms [@problem_id:2170841].

Distinct stereoisomers are therefore the orbits of the $C_2$-action generated by this reversal. By Burnside’s lemma, the number $N$ of distinct stereoisomers is\n$$\nN=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(|\\mathrm{Fix}(\\mathrm{id})|+|\\mathrm{Fix}(\\mathrm{rev})|\\right).\n$$\nHere, $|\\mathrm{Fix}(\\mathrm{id})|=2^{4}$ is the total number of configurations.
