The two isolated molecules are specified as having configurations (2R, 3R) and (2S, 3S). \n\nBy the definition of enantiomers, a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superposable mirror images have all stereocenters inverted relative to each other. In a molecule with two stereocenters, the configuration pair $(R,R)$ versus $(S,S)$ constitutes such a relationship, as both centers are inverted. Therefore, (2R, 3R) and (2S, 3S) are enantiomers.\n\nThey are not diastereomers, which would require the stereoisomers to differ at some but not all stereocenters (e.g., $(R,R)$ vs $(R,S)$). They are not constitutional isomers because the connectivity is the same. They are not meso compounds; the meso form of tartaric acid corresponds to $(2R,3S)$ or equivalently $(2S,3R)$, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. They are not conformational isomers, which differ by rotation about single bonds without changing stereocenter configurations.

Stereoisomers have the same atom connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement. Enantiomers are a pair of non-superimposable mirror-image stereoisomers; crucially, both members of an enantiomeric pair must be chiral. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Constitutional isomers differ in connectivity, and conformational isomers interconvert by rotation without breaking bonds while keeping the same configuration at stereocenters.\n\nIsomer A is specified as the cis-1,3 isomer with an internal plane of symmetry, hence achiral. For identical substituents at C-1 and C-3 on cyclobutane in the cis relationship, the molecule is meso: it contains two stereocenters but is achiral due to the internal mirror plane. In configurational terms, the two configurational assignments 1R,3S and 1S,3R are identical by symmetry for this cis meso form.\n\nIsomer B is specified as the chiral stereoisomer with absolute configuration (1R,3R). Its mirror image is the distinct (1S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, Isomer B is chiral.\n\nComparing Isomer A and Isomer B: they have the same connectivity, so they are not constitutional isomers. Isomer A is achiral and cannot be the mirror image of the chiral Isomer B, so they are not enantiomers. They differ in configuration at at least one stereocenter (e.g., comparing the meso assignment 1R,3S for A with 1R,3R for B shows one stereocenter matches and the other differs), and they are not related by mere conformational change. Therefore, they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, which by definition are diastereomers.\n\nHence, the precise stereochemical relationship is diastereomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2196681"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to connect the microscopic world of molecular structure to macroscopic, observable properties like optical activity. The hypothetical scenario involving trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane pushes you to differentiate between rapidly interconverting conformers, which are different shapes of the same molecule, and separable configurational enantiomers. Correctly explaining the optical inactivity of the sample requires a deep understanding of the distinction between conformational and configurational isomerism, a cornerstone of advanced stereochemical analysis [@problem_id:2196728].", "problem": "Consider the molecule trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane, which exists at room temperature as a rapidly equilibrating mixture of two principal chair conformations. In Conformation A, the two bromine atoms occupy axial positions (diaxial). In Conformation B, the two bromine atoms occupy equatorial positions (diequatorial). Through experimental observation, it is determined that a standard, synthesized sample of trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane is optically inactive, meaning it does not rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. This is observed despite the fact that a careful analysis reveals that neither Conformation A nor Conformation B possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct and most fundamental explanation for the observed optical inactivity of the sample?\n\nA. Conformation A and Conformation B are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. The rapid interconversion between these enantiomeric conformations at room temperature creates, in effect, a racemic mixture, rendering the bulk sample optically inactive.\n\nB. A standard sample of trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane is a racemic mixture of two stable configurational enantiomers, (1R,2R) and (1S,2S). The observed optical inactivity is due to the presence of equal amounts of these two enantiomers, a fact independent of the conformational equilibrium.\n\nC. Conformation B (diequatorial) is significantly more stable than Conformation A and is intrinsically achiral due to the presence of a center of inversion. Since this achiral conformer overwhelmingly dominates the equilibrium, the sample is optically inactive.\n\nD. trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane is classified as a meso compound because the two bromine substituents are identical. Meso compounds are inherently achiral, so the sample is optically inactive regardless of which conformation is adopted.\n\nE. Both Conformation A and Conformation B are, upon careful inspection, achiral. Their apparent lack of a symmetry plane is misleading, as they each possess a twofold rotational axis of symmetry ($C_2$) that renders them superimposable on their mirror images.", "solution": "Identify the stereochemical elements. In trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane there are two stereogenic centers (at C1 and C2). For the trans relationship with identical substituents, the two configurational stereoisomers are the enantiomeric pair $(1R,2R)$ and $(1S,2S)$.\n\nRelate conformations to configuration. In a given configurational enantiomer, the two principal chair conformations are related by a ring flip: Conformation A (diaxial) and Conformation B (diequatorial). A ring flip interconverts axial and equatorial orientations but does not alter the absolute configurations at stereocenters; therefore A and B for a given sample are conformers of the same configurational enantiomer, not mirror images of each other. Consequently, Conformation A and Conformation B are not enantiomeric; they are conformers of the same enantiomer, so option A is incorrect.\n\nConnect chirality of conformers with optical activity. The statement in the problem that neither A nor B has an internal plane of symmetry implies each conformer is chiral. Rapid interconversion between chiral conformers of a single enantiomer does not cancel optical rotation; if only one configurational enantiomer were present, the sample would be optically active despite fast chair flipping. Thus conformational dynamics alone cannot explain optical inactivity.\n\nIdentify the fundamental cause of optical inactivity. Optical inactivity of a standard sample arises because it is a racemic mixture of the two configurational enantiomers $(1R,2R)$ and $(1S,2S)$ produced under typical (achiral) synthesis conditions. The equal and opposite rotations of these enantiomers cancel in bulk, independent of the conformational equilibrium within each enantiomer. This directly supports option B.\n\nEliminate the remaining options:\n- Option C is incorrect because the diequatorial conformer is not intrinsically achiral; it lacks an inversion center, and the problem explicitly notes no internal mirror plane for either conformer. Moreover, even overwhelming population of a single chiral conformer would not render a pure enantiomer optically inactive.\n- Option D is incorrect because having identical substituents does not make a compound meso. Meso character requires an internal symmetry element (e.g., a mirror plane or $S_{n}$), which trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane lacks.\n- Option E is incorrect because a mere $C_{2}$ axis does not ensure achirality; achirality requires at least one of $\\sigma$, $i$, or $S_{n}$ symmetry. Furthermore, these conformers do not possess such symmetry elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct and most fundamental explanation is that a standard sample is racemic in $(1R,2R)$ and $(1S,2S)$, making it optically inactive independently of conformational interconversion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2196728"}]}
