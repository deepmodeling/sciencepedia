Both (1R,3R)-1,3-dichlorocyclopentane and (1S,3S)-1,3-dichlorocyclopentane are meso compounds.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must first understand the definition of a meso compound and then analyze the stereoisomers of 1,3-dichlorocyclopentane.\n\nA meso compound is a molecule that contains two or more stereocenters but is achiral overall. Achirality in such cases is typically due to an internal element of symmetry, most commonly a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$-plane), which causes the molecule to be superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nLet's analyze the possible stereoisomers of 1,3-dichlorocyclopentane. The stereochemistry can be described using either relative stereochemistry (cis/trans) or absolute stereochemistry (R/S).\n\n1.  **Analysis of the *trans*-isomers:**\n    In the *trans*-1,3-dichlorocyclopentane isomers, one chlorine atom is oriented 'up' relative to the plane of the cyclopentane ring, and the other is oriented 'down'. Let's consider such a molecule and its mirror image. There is no internal plane of symmetry that can divide the molecule into two identical, reflecting halves. If you attempt to superimpose the molecule on its mirror image, you will find that it is not possible. Therefore, the *trans* isomer is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, known as enantiomers.\n    These two enantiomers correspond to the absolute configurations (1R,3R)-1,3-dichlorocyclopentane and (1S,3S)-1,3-dichlorocyclopentane. Since they are chiral, they cannot be meso compounds. This eliminates options A and B. Consequently, option D, which claims both are meso, is also incorrect.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the *cis*-isomer:**\n    In the *cis*-1,3-dichlorocyclopentane isomer, both chlorine atoms are oriented on the same side of the cyclopentane ring (both 'up' or both 'down'). This specific arrangement introduces an element of symmetry into the molecule. A plane of symmetry can be passed through the molecule containing the C-4 atom and bisecting the C1-C3 internal distance. This plane reflects the C-1 half of the molecule (including its chlorine atom) onto the C-3 half (including its chlorine atom). Because the molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry, it is superimposable on its mirror image. A molecule that has stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image is, by definition, a meso compound. The absolute configurations at the stereocenters for the cis isomer are (1R,3S). Note that (1S,3R) describes the exact same molecule due to this symmetry, they are not different compounds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe *trans* isomers, (1R,3R) and (1S,3S), form an enantiomeric pair and are chiral. The *cis* isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having two stereocenters.

Substituents at $C_{2}$ are $\\text{Br}$, $\\text{H}$, the $C_{1}$ side ($\\text{CH}_{3}$), and the $C_{3}$ side (which leads to $C_{3}$–$C_{4}$–$C_{5}$).

Each of $C_{2}$ and $C_{4}$ is thus a stereogenic center.\n\nA meso compound is achiral despite having stereocenters; the necessary condition is an internal plane of symmetry that relates the two stereocenters. For 2,4-dibromopentane, the carbon backbone is symmetric with respect to $C_{3}$ because $C_{1}$ and $C_{5}$ are both $\\text{CH}_{3}$, and the chain reflects left-to-right through a plane passing through $C_{3}$.\n\nFor such a plane of symmetry to exist in a molecule with two equivalent stereocenters situated symmetrically about the midpoint, the configurations at those centers must be opposite. Concretely:\n- If $C_{2}$ is $R$ and $C_{4}$ is $S$, the left half reflects into the right half, giving an internal mirror plane and an achiral (meso) compound.\n- If $C_{2}$ is $S$ and $C_{4}$ is $R$, the same meso relationship holds.\n- If both are $R$ or both are $S$, the molecule is chiral and the pair forms enantiomers, not a meso form.\n\nAmong the provided options, only the designation with opposite configurations at positions $2$ and $4$ corresponds to the meso stereoisomer. Specifically, $(2R,4S)$ is listed as option C. The options $(2R,4R)$ and $(2S,4S)$ (A and B) are chiral enantiomers. Option D names a different constitutional isomer (2,3-dibromopentane), which does not have the required left-right symmetry about the central carbon in pentane.

This final problem presents a molecule, 2,3-dibromopentane, that has two stereocenters but lacks the necessary constitutional symmetry for a meso isomer to exist. By working through this example, you will learn to distinguish between molecules that can and cannot have meso forms, reinforcing the crucial idea that the entire molecular structure, not just the configurations of its stereocenters, determines achirality.[@problem_id:2183764]", "problem": "Consider the acyclic alkane, 2,3-dibromopentane.

Select the option that provides the correct conclusion and reasoning.\n\nA. Yes, because any molecule with two stereogenic centers will have a meso stereoisomer.\n\nB. No, because the carbon skeleton is not symmetric with respect to the two stereogenic centers, which prevents the existence of an internal plane of symmetry in any of its stereoisomers.\n\nC.

No, because meso compounds can only exist for molecules that have halogen atoms on adjacent carbons.\n\nE. Yes, because rotating the C2-C3 bond allows for a conformation with a plane of symmetry.", "solution": "A meso compound must satisfy two conditions:\n1) It contains at least two stereogenic centers with opposite configurations (e.g., one R and one S).\n2) The entire molecule possesses an internal symmetry element (typically a mirror plane) that makes it achiral; equivalently, there must be a symmetry operation that exchanges the two stereocenters and maps each substituent set at one center onto an identical set at the other.\n\nFor 2,3-dibromopentane, the carbon skeleton is $\\text{CH}_3\\text{–CH(Br)–CH(Br)–CH}_2\\text{–CH}_3$. The two stereogenic centers are C2 and C3. The substituent sets at C2 are {Br, H, $\\text{CH}_3$, $\\text{CH(Br)CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$}, whereas at C3 they are {Br, H, $\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$, $\\text{CH(Br)CH}_3$}. For a meso form to exist, there must be an internal mirror plane (or equivalent symmetry) that maps C2 to C3 and maps each substituent at C2 to an identical substituent at C3. However, the terminal groups $\\text{CH}_3$ and $\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$ are not identical, so no symmetry plane can map the $\\text{CH}_3$ end onto the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$ end. Conformational changes such as rotation about the C2–C3 bond cannot change the identity of the terminal groups; therefore, no conformation can create an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nConsequently, the stereoisomers are as follows: (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) form an enantiomeric pair, and (2R,3S) and (2S,3R) form another enantiomeric pair. Because there is no internal symmetry, the (2R,3S) and (2S,3R) isomers are chiral and are not meso. This directly rules out statements claiming a meso form for this molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that no meso stereoisomer exists for 2,3-dibromopentane because the unsymmetrical carbon skeleton prevents an internal plane of symmetry in any stereoisomer. This corresponds to option B. Options A and D are false generalizations; option C incorrectly asserts achirality for (2R,3S); option E incorrectly claims that bond rotation can generate a symmetry plane despite nonidentical ends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2183764"}]}
