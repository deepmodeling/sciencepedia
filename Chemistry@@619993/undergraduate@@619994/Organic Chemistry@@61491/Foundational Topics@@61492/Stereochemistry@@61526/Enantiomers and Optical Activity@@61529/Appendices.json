To assign $R/S$ at each stereocenter, we apply the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules. After ranking the four substituents $1$ (highest) to $4$ (lowest), if the lowest priority group (priority $4$) lies on a horizontal bond (toward the viewer), the sense of rotation inferred from the $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ order is inverted.\n\nThe molecule is 2,3-butanediol, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH}_3$, with stereocenters at C2 and C3.
