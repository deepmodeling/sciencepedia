We will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules for assigning priority.\n\nStep 1: Determine the structure and identify the stereocenter.\nThe parent chain is \"propanoic acid,\" which is a three-carbon carboxylic acid. Let's number the carbons starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n$$ \\underset{\\text{C3}}{\\text{CH}_3}-\\underset{\\text{C2}}{\\text{CH}}-\\underset{\\text{C1}}{\\text{COOH}} $$\nThe name \"2-(4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl)propanoic acid\" indicates that at position C2 of the propanoic acid chain, there is a phenyl group substituent. This phenyl group is itself substituted at its position 4 (para) with a \"2-methylpropyl\" group (commonly known as an isobutyl group).\n\nThe stereocenter is the chiral carbon, which is the carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this structure, C2 of the propanoic acid chain is the stereocenter.\n\nStep 2: Identify the four groups attached to the stereocenter (C2).\nThe four groups attached to C2 are:\n1.  A hydrogen atom (-H).\n2.  A methyl group (-CH3), which is C3 of the propanoic acid chain.\n3.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which involves C1 of the propanoic acid chain.\n4.  A 4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl group.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to assign priorities.\nRule 1: Priority is assigned based on the atomic number of the atoms directly bonded to the stereocenter. Higher atomic number gets higher priority.\n\nThe atoms directly bonded to the stereocenter (C2) are:\n-   From the -H group: a hydrogen atom (H, atomic number Z=1).\n-   From the -CH3 group: a carbon atom (C, atomic number Z=6).\n-   From the -COOH group: a carbon atom (C, atomic number Z=6).\n-   From the 4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl group: a carbon atom (C, atomic number Z=6).\n\nThe hydrogen atom has the lowest atomic number (Z=1). Therefore, the -H group has the lowest priority, which is priority 4.\n\nStep 4: Break the tie for the remaining three groups.\nSince the -CH3, -COOH, and phenyl groups are all attached via a carbon atom, we have a tie. To break the tie, we look at the atoms attached to these carbons (the \"first point of difference\" rule). We list the atoms bonded to each of these carbons in order of decreasing atomic number.\n\n-   For the carbon of the -COOH group (C1): This carbon is double-bonded to one oxygen and single-bonded to another oxygen. In the CIP system, a double bond to an atom is treated as two single bonds to that same atom. So, the atoms attached to C1 are effectively (O, O, O).\n-   For the carbon of the 4-(...)phenyl group: This carbon is part of the aromatic ring. It is bonded to two other carbons within the ring and implicitly to the stereocenter C2. For assigning priority, we look at what it's bonded to *away* from the stereocenter. It is bonded to two other carbons in the ring. So, the list of atoms is (C, C, C) - this is a slight simplification, for aromatic rings it's more complex, but its bonds are to other carbons. Let's be more precise: it's bonded to two other ring carbons and has a double bond character so we can list it as (C, C, C).\n-   For the carbon of the -CH3 group (C3): This carbon is bonded to three hydrogen atoms. The list of atoms is (H, H, H).\n\nNow, let's compare the lists for the three tied groups:\n-   -COOH group: (O, O, O)\n-   4-(...)phenyl group: (C, C, C)\n-   -CH3 group: (H, H, H)\n\nWe compare the first atom in each list. The atomic numbers are O (Z=8), C (Z=6), and H (Z=1). Since O > C > H, the priorities are determined at this first level of comparison.\n\nThe -COOH group (first atom O) has the highest priority. Thus, -COOH is priority 1.\nThe 4-(...)phenyl group (first atom C) has the next highest priority. Thus, the phenyl group is priority 2.\nThe -CH3 group (first atom H) has the lowest priority among these three. Thus, -CH3 is priority 3.\n\nStep 5: Final conclusion.\nBased on the CIP rules:\n-   Highest priority (1): -COOH group\n-   Lowest priority (4): -H group\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2180251"}, {"introduction": "When a molecule contains more than one stereocenter, the number of possible stereoisomers increases, creating relationships like enantiomers and diastereomers. While the van 't Hoff rule, which states the maximum number of stereoisomers is $2^n$ (where $n$ is the number of stereocenters), is a powerful starting point, it's not the full story. This exercise [@problem_id:2180238] challenges you to explore how internal molecular symmetry can lead to the formation of meso compounds—achiral molecules with chiral centers—which reduces the total number of unique stereoisomers.", "problem": "An organic chemist is analyzing the stereochemical properties of two constitutional isomers of dichloropentane. The first isomer, designated Compound X, is 1,2-dichloropentane. The second isomer, designated Compound Y, is 2,4-dichloropentane.\n\nYour task is to determine two specific values based on the stereochemistry of these compounds. First, determine the total number of possible stereoisomers for Compound X. Second, determine the number of stereoisomers of Compound Y that are meso compounds.\n\nProvide your answer as a pair of integers, representing the total number of stereoisomers for Compound X and the number of meso isomers for Compound Y, in that order.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must analyze the structure of each compound to identify the number of stereocenters and any molecular symmetry, which together determine the number and types of stereoisomers.\n\nFirst, let's consider Compound X, which is 1,2-dichloropentane. Its chemical structure is `CH2(Cl)-CH(Cl)-CH2-CH2-CH3`. We need to identify any stereocenters, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\nLet's examine the carbon atoms in the chain:\n- C1 is bonded to one Cl atom, two H atoms, and the rest of the carbon chain (`-CH(Cl)CH2CH2CH3`). Since it is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms, C1 is not a stereocenter.\n- C2 is bonded to one H atom, one Cl atom, a chloromethyl group (`-CH2Cl`), and a propyl group (`-CH2CH2CH3`). These four groups are all different. Therefore, C2 is a stereocenter.\n- C3, C4, and C5 are parts of `CH2` or `CH3` groups and are not stereocenters.\nSo, Compound X has exactly one stereocenter ($n=1$).\nFor a molecule with $n$ stereocenters, the maximum number of stereoisomers is given by the formula $2^n$. Since this molecule has no internal symmetry that would create meso compounds (which require at least two stereocenters), the total number of stereoisomers is exactly $2^n$. With $n=1$, the total number of stereoisomers for Compound X is $2^1 = 2$. These two stereoisomers are a pair of enantiomers (the R-isomer and the S-isomer).\n\nNext, we analyze Compound Y, which is 2,4-dichloropentane. Its chemical structure is `CH3-CH(Cl)-CH2-CH(Cl)-CH3`. We again identify the stereocenters.\n- C1 and C5 are methyl groups, so they are not stereocenters.\n- C2 is bonded to an H atom, a Cl atom, a methyl group (`-CH3`), and the rest of the chain (`-CH2CH(Cl)CH3`). These four groups are different, so C2 is a stereocenter.\n- C3 is a `CH2` group, so it is not a stereocenter.\n- C4 is bonded to an H atom, a Cl atom, a methyl group (`-CH3`), and the rest of the chain (`-CH2CH(Cl)CH3`). These four groups are different, so C4 is a stereocenter.\nThus, Compound Y has two stereocenters ($n=2$).\n\nNow, we must check for symmetry in Compound Y. The molecule can be viewed as `(CH3-CH(Cl)-)-CH2-(-CH(Cl)-CH3)`. The two parts of the molecule on either side of the central `CH2` group are identical. This means the molecule possesses an element of symmetry relating the two stereocenters, C2 and C4. The two stereocenters are structurally equivalent.\nFor a molecule with an even number of $n$ equivalent stereocenters, the total number of stereoisomers is less than $2^n$ due to the existence of meso compounds. The possible stereochemical configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n- The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute one pair of enantiomers and are chiral.\n- Let's consider the (2R, 4S) isomer. Due to the molecule's symmetry, this configuration has an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule as a whole achiral. An achiral compound that contains stereocenters is called a meso compound. Its mirror image is the (2S, 4R) isomer. However, the (2S, 4R) molecule is superimposable on the (2R, 4S) molecule (e.g., by a 180-degree rotation in the plane). Therefore, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same, single meso compound.\nSo, for Compound Y, there are a total of 3 stereoisomers: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\nThe question asks for the number of stereoisomers of Compound Y that are meso compounds. This number is 1.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Total number of stereoisomers for Compound X = 2.\n- Number of meso isomers for Compound Y = 1.\n\nThe final answer requires the pair of these two integers in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2180238"}, {"introduction": "In the laboratory and in industry, chiral molecules are often synthesized as mixtures of enantiomers.
