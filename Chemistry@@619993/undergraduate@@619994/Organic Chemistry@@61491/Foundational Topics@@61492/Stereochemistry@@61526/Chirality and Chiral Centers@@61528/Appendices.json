The molecule is known to be a specific enantiomer of 2-chloropentane, as named by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) system. The chiral center is the carbon atom at position 2 (C2).\n\nThe analysis provides the following spatial description of the groups attached to the C2 atom:\n1.  A hydrogen atom.\n2.  A chlorine atom.\n3.  A methyl group ($-CH_3$), which is carbon C1 of the pentane chain.\n4.

From this vantage point, the three other groups (chlorine, methyl, and propyl) appear to be arranged in a clockwise sequence: propyl, then chlorine, then methyl.\n\nRelevant atomic numbers are: Chlorine (Cl) = 17, Carbon (C) = 6, Hydrogen (H) = 1.\n\nBased on this spatial arrangement, what is the correct and complete IUPAC name for this enantiomer?\n\nA) (R)-2-chloropentane\nB) (S)-2-chloropentane\nC) The molecule is achiral, so no (R) or (S) designator is needed.\nD) The information provided is insufficient to determine the configuration.", "solution": "To determine the absolute configuration and the correct IUPAC name for the described enantiomer of 2-chloropentane, we follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral center and the four attached groups.**\nThe problem states that the molecule is 2-chloropentane and the chiral center is the carbon at position 2 (C2). The four groups bonded to this carbon are:\n*   A chlorine atom (-Cl)\n*   A propyl group ($-CH_2CH_2CH_3$)\n*   A methyl group ($-CH_3$)\n*   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to the four groups based on the CIP rules.**\nThe priority is determined by the atomic number of the atom directly attached to the chiral center. A higher atomic number corresponds to a higher priority.\n\n1.  **Chlorine (-Cl):** The atomic number of Cl is 17.\n2.  **Propyl group ($-CH_2CH_2CH_3$):** The atom directly attached to C2 is a carbon (C), with atomic number 6.\n3.  **Methyl group ($-CH_3$):** The atom directly attached to C2 is also a carbon (C), with atomic number 6.\n4.  **Hydrogen (-H):** The atomic number of H is 1.\n\nBased on the directly attached atoms, the chlorine atom has the highest priority (priority 1), and the hydrogen atom has the lowest priority (priority 4).\n\nTo distinguish between the propyl and methyl groups, we must examine the atoms attached to their respective carbons (the \"first point of difference\" rule).\n*   For the propyl group, the carbon attached to C2 is bonded to one other carbon (from the $-CH_2CH_3$ part) and two hydrogens.\n*   For the methyl group, the carbon attached to C2 is bonded only to three hydrogens.\n\nComparing the atoms attached to these carbons, the propyl group's carbon is bonded to an atom with a higher atomic number (Carbon, Z=6) than any atom the methyl group's carbon is bonded to (Hydrogen, Z=1). Therefore, the propyl group has a higher priority than the methyl group.\n\nThe complete priority assignment is:\n*   Priority 1: -Cl\n*   Priority 2: $-CH_2CH_2CH_3$ (propyl)\n*   Priority 3: $-CH_3$ (methyl)\n*   Priority 4: -H\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration (R or S) from the 3D description.**\nThe problem specifies the orientation for determining the configuration: viewing the molecule down the C2-H bond, with the hydrogen atom (the lowest priority group, #4) pointing away from the observer. This is the standard orientation for assigning configuration.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, the remaining three groups are observed in a **clockwise** sequence: propyl -> chlorine -> methyl. Let's visualize this arrangement on a 2D plane representing the view:\n*   Propyl group is priority #2.\n*   Chlorine atom is priority #1.\n*   Methyl group is priority #3.\n\nThe observed clockwise progression is (Propyl) -> (Chlorine) -> (Methyl). To determine the configuration, we must trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3.\n*   Start at Priority 1 (-Cl).\n*   Move to Priority 2 ($-CH_2CH_2CH_3$).\n*   Move to Priority 3 ($-CH_3$).\n\nLet's place the groups on a circle according to the problem's description. If we place the propyl group (#2) at the top (12 o'clock), moving clockwise takes us to the chlorine group (#1), and continuing clockwise takes us to the methyl group (#3).\nSo, the arrangement is:\n*   Propyl (#2) at 12 o'clock.\n*   Chlorine (#1) at roughly 4 o'clock.\n*   Methyl (#3) at roughly 8 o'clock.\n\nNow, we trace the standard path from 1 -> 2 -> 3:\n*   The path from Chlorine (#1) to Propyl (#2) is a **counter-clockwise** motion (from 4 o'clock to 12 o'clock).\n*   The path from Propyl (#2) to Methyl (#3) continues this **counter-clockwise** motion (from 12 o'clock to 8 o'clock).\n\nSince the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 is counter-clockwise, and the lowest priority group (#4) is in the back, the configuration is **(S)**.\n\nThe full name of the molecule is (S)-2-chloropentane.\n\n**Step 4: Select the corresponding option.**\nThe derived name is (S)-2-chloropentane, which matches option B.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the lack of any improper axis of rotation ($S_n$), which includes planes of symmetry ($S_1$, denoted as $\\sigma$) and centers of inversion ($S_2$, denoted as $i$).\n\nStep 1: Identify potential stereocenters.\nA stereocenter (or chiral center) is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the structure of *cis*-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane.\n- The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to:\n    1. A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2. A methyl group ($-CH_3$)\n    3. A $-CH_2-CH_2-CH(CH_3)-$ segment of the ring\n    4. A $-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_2-$ segment of the ring\nSince these four groups are different, C1 is a stereocenter.\n- The carbon atom at position 3 (C3) is also bonded to four different groups by similar logic.\n    1. A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2. A methyl group ($-CH_3$)\n    3. A $-CH_2-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-$ segment of the ring\n    4. A $-CH_2-CH_2-CH(CH_3)-$ segment of the ring\nTherefore, C3 is also a stereocenter. The molecule contains two stereocenters.\n\nStep 2: Check for overall molecular symmetry.\nA molecule that contains stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Such a compound is called a meso compound.\nTo analyze the symmetry of *cis*-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane, we should consider its three-dimensional chair conformations. In a cyclohexyl ring, a *cis*-1,3 substitution pattern means both substituents are on the same side of the ring. This can be achieved with both methyl groups in axial positions (diaxial) or both in equatorial positions (diequatorial).\n\nLet's analyze the more stable diequatorial conformation. In this conformation, both methyl groups point away from the ring in equatorial positions. If we orient the molecule appropriately, we can identify a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$). This plane passes through C2 and C5 and bisects the C1-C6 and C3-C4 bonds. This plane acts as a mirror, reflecting the C1-$CH_3$ group onto the C3-$CH_3$ group, and the C6 atom onto the C4 atom. The presence of this plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nEven in the less stable diaxial conformation, where both methyl groups point upwards (or downwards) from the ring, the same plane of symmetry through C2 and C5 exists.\n\nBecause the molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry in its accessible conformations, it is achiral. Since it is an achiral molecule that contains stereocenters, it fits the definition of a meso compound.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. The molecule is achiral because it is a meso compound. This is correct. It has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n- B. The molecule is chiral because it contains two stereocenters. This is a common misconception. The presence of stereocenters is a necessary condition for chirality in many cases, but it is not sufficient. Molecules with stereocenters and internal symmetry (meso compounds) are achiral.\n- C. The molecule is achiral because it contains no stereocenters. This is incorrect. As shown in Step 1, C1 and C3 are stereocenters.\n- D. The molecule is chiral because its most stable conformation lacks a plane of symmetry. This is factually incorrect. The most stable conformation (diequatorial) possesses a plane of symmetry.\n- E. The molecule is chiral because it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, which is its *trans* isomer. This statement is incorrect. The mirror image of a molecule is never its diastereomer (like the *trans* isomer). Furthermore, as established, the molecule *is* superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that *cis*-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane is an achiral meso compound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2160149"}, {"introduction": "The concept of chirality has profound real-world consequences, particularly in pharmacology where enantiomers can have vastly different biological activities.
