The carbon chain is numbered starting from the carboxylic acid group at the top.\n\n*   **Top group (on C1):** -COOH\n*   **C2 substituents:** -NH2 on the left, -H on the right\n*   **C3 substituents:** -H on the left, -OH on the right\n*   **Bottom group (on C4):** -CH3\n\nAlex performs the following step-by-step analysis to determine the configuration at C2:\n\n**Step A:** The four groups attached to the C2 stereocenter are identified as the amino group (-NH2), the hydrogen atom (-H), the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the group attached at C3 (a sec-hydroxypropyl group, hereafter called the C3-substituent).\n\n**Step B:** The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority is assigned based on the atomic number of the atom directly bonded to C2. Nitrogen (in -NH2, atomic number 7) has a higher atomic number than Carbon (in -COOH and the C3-substituent, atomic number 6), which has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen (atomic number 1). Therefore, -NH2 is priority 1 and -H is priority 4.\n\n**Step C:** To differentiate between the two carbon-based groups, -COOH and the C3-substituent, we examine the atoms attached to them. The carbon in -COOH is considered bonded to (O, O, O) due to the C=O double bond. The C3 carbon in the C3-substituent is bonded to an oxygen, another carbon (C4, the methyl group), and a hydrogen, so we list them as (O, C, H). Comparing the two lists atom by atom, the first point of difference is the second atom: O in -COOH versus C in the C3-substituent. Since O has a higher atomic number than C, the -COOH group is assigned a higher priority.\n\n**Step D:** The final priority order for the groups attached to C2 is: -NH2 (1), -COOH (2), C3-substituent (3), and -H (4).\n\n**Step E:** With the priorities established, Alex notes that the lowest-priority group (-H) is on a horizontal line. He then traces the path from the highest priority group (1) to the second (2) to the third (3). This path from -NH2 to -COOH to the C3-substituent traces a clockwise arc.\n\n**Step F:** Based on the clockwise direction of the 1 -> 2 -> 3 path, Alex concludes that the configuration of the stereocenter at C2 is R.\n\nCarefully review Alex's analysis. Identify the specific step that contains the first error in reasoning or procedure. If the entire analysis is correct, select the option indicating no error.\n\nA.

This matches Step A, so Step A is correct.\n\nAssign CIP priorities by the atomic numbers of the atoms directly bonded to C2: $\\text{N}\\ (Z=7) > \\text{C}\\ (Z=6) > \\text{H}\\ (Z=1)$. Thus $-\\text{NH}_2$ is priority $1$ and $-\\text{H}$ is priority $4$, confirming Step B is correct.\n\nTo distinguish the two carbon-based groups, apply CIP next-layer comparison. For $-\\text{COOH}$, the directly attached carbon is considered bonded to $\\{\\text{O},\\text{O},\\text{O}\\}$ (double bond counted as two $\\text{O}$, plus the single bond to O). For the C3 carbon, exclude the back bond to C2 and list $\\{\\text{O},\\text{C},\\text{H}\\}$. Comparing $\\{\\text{O},\\text{O},\\text{O}\\}$ with $\\{\\text{O},\\text{C},\\text{H}\\}$ gives the first difference at the second position: $\\text{O}>\\text{C}$, so $-\\text{COOH}$ outranks the C3-substituent. Step C is correct.\n\nThus the priority order is $1:-\\text{NH}_2$, $2:-\\text{COOH}$, $3:\\text{C3-substituent}$, $4:-\\text{H}$, matching Step D.\n\nIn a Fischer projection, horizontal substituents project toward the viewer and vertical substituents project away.

These observations in Step E are correct.\n\nFor assigning the configuration, when the lowest-priority group is toward the viewer, the sense is inverted: a clockwise $1\\to 2\\to 3$ path corresponds to $S$, and a counterclockwise path corresponds to $R$.

In the problem, both molecules are drawn with the same Fischer convention: the main chain C1 to C6 is vertical, with the same vertical substituents at each stereocenter. Therefore, comparing horizontal substituents at each center directly reflects the relative configurations.\n\nFrom the descriptions:\n- At C2: Molecule A has left H and right Cl; Molecule B has left H and right Cl. Hence, C2 has the same configuration in A and B.\n- At C3: Molecule A has left Cl and right H; Molecule B has left H and right Cl. Hence, C3 is inverted between A and B.\n- At C4: Molecule A has left Me and right H; Molecule B has left Me and right H. Hence, C4 has the same configuration in A and B.\n\nThus, among the three stereocenters, exactly one (C3) is inverted between the two molecules, while the others (C2 and C4) are unchanged. Since not all stereocenters are inverted, the molecules are not enantiomers. Since at least one stereocenter differs, they are not identical. The connectivity is the same, so they are not constitutional isomers. Therefore, by definition, they are diastereomers.\n\nIn summary, with $n=3$ stereocenters, enantiomers require inversion at all $n$ centers; here only one center is inverted, so the relationship is diastereomeric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2155533"}]}
