This exercise challenges you to compare the electrophilicity of several common carbonyl compounds, focusing on how different alkyl substituents influence the reactivity of the carbonyl carbon. Mastering this analysis is a crucial first step toward designing and understanding nucleophilic addition reactions. [@problem_id:2168259]", "problem": "In a study of nucleophilic addition reactions, the intrinsic reactivity of various carbonyl compounds is being compared. The rate of these reactions is heavily influenced by the electronic and steric properties of the groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. Consider three common carbonyl compounds:\n\n- Compound I: Formaldehyde (methanal)\n- Compound II: Acetaldehyde (ethanal)\n- Compound III: Acetone (propan-2-one)\n\nThe electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon atom is a primary determinant of the compound's reactivity towards a nucleophile. Based on the principles of electronic effects and steric hindrance, arrange these three compounds in order of increasing electrophilicity of their carbonyl carbon.\n\nA. I < II < III\n\nB. III < II < I\n\nC. II < III < I\n\nD. III < I < II\n\nE. I < III < II\n\nF. II < I < III", "solution": "Electrophilicity at the carbonyl carbon arises from polarization of the $C=O$ bond, where oxygen, being more electronegative, bears $\\delta^{-}$ and the carbon bears $\\delta^{+}$. The magnitude of the positive charge at carbon is increased by electron-withdrawing groups and decreased by electron-donating groups through the inductive effect and hyperconjugation. Alkyl groups exert a $+I$ effect and can stabilize the carbocation-like character at the carbonyl carbon by hyperconjugation, thereby lowering its electrophilicity.\n\nCompare the substituents:\n- Formaldehyde (I) has two hydrogens attached to the carbonyl carbon. Hydrogens do not donate electron density by $+I$ or hyperconjugation, so the carbonyl carbon retains a relatively large $\\delta^{+}$ and is highly electrophilic. Sterically, it is also least hindered.\n- Acetaldehyde (II) has one methyl group and one hydrogen. The single alkyl $+I$ and hyperconjugative donation partially reduce the $\\delta^{+}$ at the carbonyl carbon relative to formaldehyde, lowering electrophilicity compared to I. Steric hindrance is moderate.\n- Acetone (III) has two methyl groups. Two alkyl donors further decrease the $\\delta^{+}$ at the carbonyl carbon the most, giving the lowest electrophilicity among the three. Sterically, it is also the most hindered.\n\nTherefore, by electronic effects (primary for electrophilicity), the electrophilicity decreases as I $>$ II $>$ III, which means the order of increasing electrophilicity is III $<$ II $<$ I.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2168259"}, {"introduction": "In organic synthesis, we often build cyclic structures by designing molecules that can react with themselves. This practice asks you to analyze a bifunctional molecule and identify the internal nucleophile and electrophile that drive a spontaneous cyclization reaction. This skill is essential for understanding how complex ring systems, common in pharmaceuticals and natural products, are constructed. [@problem_id:2168294]", "problem": "The molecule 4-bromobutanoic acid possesses functional groups that allow it to undergo a facile intramolecular reaction to form a cyclic product, an example of a common synthetic strategy in organic chemistry. This cyclization reaction is typically promoted by the addition of a mild, non-nucleophilic base. The reaction proceeds via an internal nucleophilic attack, where a nucleophilic atom within the molecule attacks an electrophilic carbon atom in the same molecule, leading to the displacement of a leaving group and the formation of a new ring.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, the carbon atoms of the butanoic acid chain are numbered sequentially starting from the carboxylic acid carbon as C1. Given this information, identify the atom that acts as the primary nucleophile and the carbon atom that serves as the primary electrophilic center in this intramolecular cyclization.\n\nA. The nucleophilic atom is the carbonyl oxygen (the oxygen double-bonded to C1), and the electrophilic atom is C4.\n\nB. The nucleophilic atom is the hydroxyl oxygen (the oxygen single-bonded to C1), and the electrophilic atom is C4.\n\nC. The nucleophilic atom is the alpha-carbon (C2), and the electrophilic atom is C4.\n\nD. The nucleophilic atom is the hydroxyl oxygen (the oxygen single-bonded to C1), and the electrophilic atom is C1.\n\nE. The nucleophilic atom is the bromine atom, and the electrophilic atom is C1.", "solution": "We identify the functional groups present in 4-bromobutanoic acid: a carboxylic acid at C1 and a primary alkyl bromide at C4. Under the conditions specified (mild, non-nucleophilic base), the first step is acid-base deprotonation of the carboxylic acid, generating a carboxylate. This produces a nucleophilic oxygen center (resonance-stabilized over the two oxygens), with the atom originally the hydroxyl oxygen (single-bonded to C1) carrying the negative charge in one canonical form.\n\nIntramolecular cyclization proceeds by internal nucleophilic substitution. The electrophilic center in such a process is the primary carbon bearing bromine (C4), because it is activated toward substitution by the presence of the leaving group (bromide) and is sterically accessible. The carboxylate oxygen attacks intramolecularly at C4, displacing bromide in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution and forming an O–C bond. This closes a five-membered ring (a gamma-lactone), which is both kinetically accessible and thermodynamically favored among small and medium ring sizes.\n\nAmong the two resonance-equivalent oxygens of the carboxylate, the nucleophile is conventionally identified as the hydroxyl oxygen (the one single-bonded to C1 in the acid form), and the electrophile is C4. Therefore, the correct identification is that the hydroxyl oxygen is the primary nucleophile and C4 is the primary electrophilic center.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2168294"}, {"introduction": "Advanced organic synthesis is not just about making molecules react, but about controlling *how* they react. This problem explores the concept of regioselectivity using an enolate, a nucleophile with two potential points of attack. You will investigate how manipulating reaction temperature allows a chemist to choose between the kinetically and thermodynamically preferred products, a powerful tool for synthetic strategy.

The chemist performs a two-step sequence. In the first step, the ketone is treated with one equivalent of Lithium Diisopropylamide (LDA), a strong and sterically hindered base, to form an enolate ion. This deprotonation is carried out under two different temperature regimens. In the second step, an excess of methyl iodide ($CH_3I$) is added to the enolate solution to act as the electrophile.\n\n-   **Condition K**: The deprotonation is performed at a low temperature of -78 °C in tetrahydrofuran (THF), and methyl iodide is added subsequently while maintaining this low temperature.\n-   **Condition T**: The deprotonation is initially performed at -78 °C, but the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (25 °C) and equilibrate for one hour before the addition of methyl iodide.\n\nYour task is to determine the major organic product formed under Condition K and the major organic product formed under Condition T.

Deprotonation at C2 leads to a more substituted enolate, while deprotonation at C6 leads to a less substituted enolate. Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is a strong, sterically hindered, non-nucleophilic base that forms enolates under kinetic control at low temperature and under thermodynamic control when enolate equilibration is allowed.\n\nUnder Condition K, the deprotonation is carried out at low temperature in THF and methyl iodide is added without warming. These conditions favor formation and trapping of the kinetic enolate. The kinetic enolate is formed by deprotonation at the less hindered alpha position (C6), because this proton is more accessible and removal is faster. The resulting less substituted enolate attacks methyl iodide at carbon in an $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ reaction, giving methyl substitution at C6. Therefore, the major product under Condition K is 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone.\n\nUnder Condition T, the enolate is initially formed at low temperature but the solution is then warmed to room temperature and allowed to equilibrate before addition of methyl iodide. These conditions allow interconversion of enolates so that the more stable, more substituted enolate predominates. For 2-methylcyclohexanone, this thermodynamic enolate arises from deprotonation at C2 (the alpha carbon already bearing the methyl group), which gives the more substituted enolate. Alkylation of this enolate with methyl iodide at carbon furnishes the geminal dimethyl product at C2, namely 2,2-dimethylcyclohexanone.\n\nBecause LDA-generated lithium enolates reacting with methyl iodide undergo predominant C-alkylation rather than O-alkylation under these conditions, enol ether products are not the major products. Matching these outcomes to the options given, the product under Condition K is 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone and the product under Condition T is 2,2-dimethylcyclohexanone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2168297"}]}
