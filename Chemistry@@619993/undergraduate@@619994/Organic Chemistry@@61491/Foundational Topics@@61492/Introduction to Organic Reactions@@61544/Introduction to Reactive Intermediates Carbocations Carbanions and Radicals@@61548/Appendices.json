This first practice focuses on the benzyl radical, a classic example of a resonance-stabilized species. By mapping out the delocalization of the unpaired electron, you will practice the essential skill of drawing resonance structures to identify which atoms share the radical character, a key factor in its stability and reactivity [@problem_id:2179975].", "problem": "The benzyl radical is a reactive intermediate formed by the homolytic cleavage of a carbon-hydrogen bond from the methyl group of toluene ($C_6H_5CH_3$). This radical is notably stable due to the delocalization of its unpaired electron into the adjacent aromatic ring through resonance.\n\nConsider the benzyl radical, $C_6H_5CH_2^{\\cdot}$. The carbon atom of the benzene ring directly attached to the methylene ($-\\text{CH}_2^{\\cdot}$) group is designated as C1. The remaining carbons of the ring are numbered sequentially from C2 to C6.\n\nAccording to resonance theory, which carbon atoms *within the aromatic ring* bear a significant portion of the unpaired electron density?\n\nA. Carbons 1, 3, 5\n\nB. Carbons 3, 5\n\nC. Carbons 2, 4, 6\n\nD. All carbons in the ring (1 through 6)\n\nE. Only carbon 1", "solution": "We identify the benzylic radical as $C_{6}H_{5}CH_{2}^{\\cdot}$, where the benzene ring carbons are labeled with the ipso carbon bonded to the benzylic carbon as C1, the ortho positions as C2 and C6, the meta positions as C3 and C5, and the para position as C4.\n\nResonance theory states that in a conjugated system, an unpaired electron can delocalize into adjacent $\\pi$ orbitals, and the atoms that carry significant unpaired electron density are precisely those that appear as radical centers in valid resonance contributors that preserve octets (except at the radical center) and the aromatic sextet of the benzene ring.\n\nStarting from the structure with the unpaired electron on the benzylic carbon, $C_{6}H_{5}CH_{2}^{\\cdot}$, the benzylic $p$ orbital overlaps with the ring $p$ system at C1. A resonance move that combines one electron from the benzylic $p$ orbital with one electron from the $C1\\text{-}C2$ $\\pi$ bond forms a $\\pi$ bond between the benzylic carbon and C1 while shifting the remaining electron from the former $C1\\text{-}C2$ $\\pi$ bond onto C2. This yields a valid resonance contributor with the radical on C2 (an ortho position) and preserves the aromatic sextet in the ring. By analogous $\\pi$-bond shifts around the ring, the unpaired electron can be relocated from C2 to C4 (para) and then to C6 (the other ortho), each time maintaining aromaticity and valid octets. Thus, resonance places the unpaired electron density on C2, C4, and C6 within the ring.\n\nNo valid set of resonance moves places the radical on the meta carbons (C3 or C5) because the allylic-type delocalization in the benzyl system moves the radical by two positions at a time around the ring (ortho to para to ortho), never yielding a meta radical center without violating the standard resonance rules for maintaining aromatic conjugation. Likewise, the ipso carbon C1 is not a dominant radical center in the principal resonance contributors; instead, it participates in forming the benzylic–ipso double bond in those contributors that place the radical at ortho or para positions.\n\nTherefore, within the aromatic ring, the significant unpaired electron density resides at the ortho and para positions: C2, C4, and C6.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2179975"}, {"introduction": "The principles of intermediate stability have powerful predictive capabilities, extending to properties like acidity.

For an acid $HA$,\n$$\nHA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + A^{-},\n$$\na stronger acid corresponds to a more stabilized $A^{-}$. For $\\alpha$-deprotonation next to carbonyl groups, $A^{-}$ is an enolate, whose stabilization is controlled by:\n- Resonance delocalization of the negative charge onto adjacent carbonyl oxygens.\n- Inductive electron withdrawal by the carbonyl groups.\n- The intrinsic electron-withdrawing strength of the carbonyl units (ketone carbonyls are stronger electron-withdrawing and better acceptors than ester carbonyls because an $-\\text{OR}$ group donates by resonance, diminishing the net withdrawal).\n\nEvaluate each option by how well the resulting enolate distributes and stabilizes negative charge.\n\nA.

This practice presents a fascinating puzzle: why are two seemingly similar carbanions, $\\text{:CF}_3^-$ and $\\text{:CH}_2\\text{CN}^-$, structurally so different [@problem_id:2180004]? By contrasting these two species, you will explore the subtle interplay between resonance stabilization, which favors planarity for orbital overlap, and inductive or hybridization effects, which can enforce a pyramidal geometry.", "problem": "The trifluoromethyl carbanion, $\\text{:CF}_3^-$, is experimentally observed to have a pyramidal geometry, with the lone pair residing in a stereochemically active orbital. In contrast, the cyanomethyl carbanion, $\\text{:CH}_2\\text{CN}^-$, is found to be essentially planar. Which of the following statements provides the best and most complete electronic explanation for this marked difference in their structures?\n\nA. The planarity of $\\text{:CF}_3^-$ is prevented by the strong C-F sigma bonds, which are too short to allow for a 120-degree bond angle. The $\\text{:CH}_2\\text{CN}^-$ anion is planar because the C-C bond to the nitrile is long enough to accommodate a planar arrangement.\n\nB. The pyramidal shape of $\\text{:CF}_3^-$ is due to severe steric repulsion between the three fluorine atoms, forcing them into a tetrahedral-like arrangement. In $\\text{:CH}_2\\text{CN}^-$, the smaller hydrogen atoms and the linear cyano group create minimal steric strain, allowing for a planar structure.\n\nC. In $\\text{:CH}_2\\text{CN}^-$, the negative charge is delocalized through resonance into the pi system of the cyano group, an effect that requires a planar geometry for effective p-orbital overlap. In $\\text{:CF}_3^-$, resonance is not possible, and the high electronegativity of the fluorine atoms favors placing the lone pair in an orbital with increased s-character, which corresponds to a pyramidal geometry.\n\nD. The strong inductive electron-withdrawal by the three fluorine atoms in $\\text{:CF}_3^-$ pulls the negative charge away from the carbon, making the lone pair more diffuse and forcing it into a p-orbital, resulting in a planar structure. The weaker inductive effect of the cyano group in $\\text{:CH}_2\\text{CN}^-$ is not sufficient to cause this effect, so it remains pyramidal.", "solution": "The geometric dichotomy between a pyramidal carbanion and a planar carbanion correlates directly with the orbital housing the lone pair at the anionic carbon. A trigonal planar carbanion requires the lone pair to occupy an unhybridized $p$ orbital so that it can overlap with an adjacent $\\pi$ system; a trigonal pyramidal carbanion has its lone pair in a hybrid orbital ($sp^{3}$-like), which is stereochemically active and does not require planarity.\n\nApply this to the two systems:\n1. For $\\text{:CH}_2\\text{CN}^-$, the anionic center is $\\alpha$ to a nitrile. Effective delocalization of negative charge by resonance into the $\\pi$ system of the $C\\equiv N$ group requires that the carbanionic lone pair be in a $p$ orbital aligned with the nitrile $\\pi$ framework. This conjugative stabilization necessitates a planar, $sp^{2}$-like geometry at the anionic carbon to maintain optimal $p$–$\\pi$ overlap. Thus, planarity in $\\text{:CH}_2\\text{CN}^-$ is a direct consequence of resonance delocalization.\n\n2. For $\\text{:CF}_3^-$, there is no adjacent $\\pi$ acceptor for resonance; the C-F bonds are $\\sigma$ bonds, and classical resonance delocalization of the carbanionic lone pair is not available. Instead, the dominant electronic effect of fluorine is inductive withdrawal. By Bent’s rule, bonding hybrids directed toward very electronegative substituents (F) acquire greater $p$-character, which correspondingly drives the nonbonding lone-pair hybrid on carbon to have greater $s$-character. A lone pair with increased $s$-character is stabilized in a hybrid orbital oriented as in a trigonal pyramidal geometry rather than as a pure $p$ orbital in a planar structure. Any possible $n_{\\text{C}} \\rightarrow \\sigma^{*}_{C-F}$ negative hyperconjugation does not impose planarity and is maximized by a pyramidal arrangement with an $a_{1}$-like lone pair. Hence, $\\text{:CF}_3^-$ is pyramidal with a stereochemically active lone pair.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A incorrectly attributes geometry to bond-length constraints and ignores the governing orbital and resonance considerations.\n- B incorrectly assigns the geometry to steric repulsions; fluorine is small, and sterics are not the controlling factor here.\n- C correctly explains that $\\text{:CH}_2\\text{CN}^-$ is planar due to resonance delocalization requiring $p$-orbital overlap, and that $\\text{:CF}_3^-$ lacks such resonance; the high electronegativity of fluorine, via Bent’s rule, pushes the lone pair into a hybrid orbital with increased $s$-character, consistent with a pyramidal geometry.\n- D contradicts the observed pyramidal geometry of $\\text{:CF}_3^-$ by predicting planarity.\n\nTherefore, the best and most complete explanation is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2180004"}]}
