The first mechanistic step is nucleophilic addition of hydroxide to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon.

The guiding principle for an acid-base equilibrium is that the equilibrium favors the side with the weaker acid and weaker base. A weaker acid has a higher $pK_a$ value. Therefore, for a base ($\\text{B}^-$) to successfully deprotonate an acid (HA), the conjugate acid of the base (HB) must be a weaker acid than the starting acid (HA). This means the $pK_a$ of HB must be greater than the $pK_a$ of HA. In our case, the acid to be deprotonated is phenol, which has a $pK_a$ of approximately 10.0.\n\nLet's evaluate each potential base:\n\n1.  **Chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$)**: The reaction would be $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + \\text{Cl}^- \\rightleftharpoons \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^- + \\text{HCl}$. The acid being deprotonated is phenol ($pK_a$ ≈ 10.0). The conjugate acid formed is hydrochloric acid, $\\text{HCl}$ ($pK_a$ ≈ -7.0). For the reaction to be favorable, we need $pK_a$(phenol) < $pK_a$(HCl). However, 10.0 is not less than -7.0. In fact, it is much greater, meaning $\\text{HCl}$ is a vastly stronger acid than phenol. The equilibrium will lie overwhelmingly to the left. Thus, $\\text{Cl}^-$ is a very weak base and is not suitable.\n\n2.  **Water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$)**: The reaction would be $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^- + \\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$. The acid being deprotonated is phenol ($pK_a$ ≈ 10.0). The conjugate acid formed is the hydronium ion, $\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$ ($pK_a$ ≈ -1.7). For the reaction to be favorable, we need $pK_a$(phenol) < $pK_a$($\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$). However, 10.0 is not less than -1.7. The equilibrium will lie to the left. Water is also too weak a base to deprotonate phenol to any significant extent.\n\n3.  **Methoxide ion ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{O}^-$)**: The reaction would be $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + \\text{CH}_3\\text{O}^- \\rightleftharpoons \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^- + \\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$. The acid being deprotonated is phenol ($pK_a$ ≈ 10.0). The conjugate acid formed is methanol, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$ ($pK_a$ ≈ 15.5). For the reaction to be favorable, we need $pK_a$(phenol) < $pK_a$($\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$). Indeed, 10.0 is less than 15.5. This indicates that phenol is a stronger acid than methanol, so the equilibrium will favor the formation of the weaker acid (methanol) and the weaker base (phenoxide). Therefore, methoxide is a suitable and effective base for deprotonating phenol.\n\nHaving identified $\\text{CH}_3\\text{O}^-$ as the correct base, we now need to determine the correct description of the electron movement (curved arrows). Curved arrows in reaction mechanisms always show the flow of electrons, moving from a region of high electron density (a lone pair or a bond) to a region of low electron density (an atom or a bond).\n\nIn a proton transfer reaction, the base uses a pair of electrons to form a new bond with the acidic proton. Simultaneously, the bond connecting the proton to its original molecule breaks, and those electrons are transferred to the atom that was bonded to the proton.\n\nFor the reaction between methoxide and phenol:\n-   The methoxide ion ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{O}^-$) acts as the base. It has high electron density on its negatively charged oxygen atom (in the form of lone pairs).\n-   One of these lone pairs will attack the acidic proton of the phenol's hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is represented by a curved arrow originating from a lone pair on the oxygen atom of the methoxide ion and pointing to the hydrogen atom of the phenol's -OH group.\n-   As the new O-H bond forms, the existing O-H bond in phenol must break. The two electrons in this covalent bond move onto the phenol's oxygen atom, which is more electronegative than hydrogen. This is represented by a second curved arrow originating from the middle of the O-H bond in phenol and pointing to the oxygen atom of phenol.\n\nNow we evaluate the descriptions in the options:\n-   Option A uses the wrong base ($\\text{Cl}^-$).\n-   Option B uses the correct base ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{O}^-$) and correctly describes the electron flow: \"a curved arrow originating from a lone pair on the oxygen atom of the methoxide ion and pointing to the hydrogen atom of phenol's hydroxyl group, and a second curved arrow originating from the O-H bond and pointing to the oxygen atom of phenol.\" This matches our analysis.\n-   Option C uses the wrong base ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$).\n-   Option D uses the correct base ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{O}^-$) but incorrectly describes the electron flow. It states an arrow originates \"from the hydrogen atom,\" which is impossible as arrows must start from an electron source (a bond or lone pair), not an electron-deficient proton.\n-   Option E uses the wrong base ($\\text{Cl}^-$) and an entirely incorrect description of the mechanism.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the only choice that correctly identifies both the suitable base and the proper mechanism for the reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2179792"}]}
