A stronger base more effectively removes a proton from an acid, leading to a more stable conjugate acid for the base. Consider the following three anions, which can act as Brønsted-Lowry bases:\n\n- The acetylide anion, $HC \\equiv C^{−}$\n- The ethoxide anion, $CH_3CH_2O^{−}$\n- The acetate anion, $CH_3COO^{−}$\n\nWhich of the following options correctly arranges these anions in order of decreasing basicity, from the strongest base to the weakest base?\n\nA.

Ethoxide > Acetylide > Acetate", "solution": "A Brønsted-Lowry base’s strength is inversely related to the acidity of its conjugate acid. Quantitatively, if $B_{1}^{−}$ and $B_{2}^{−}$ are bases with conjugate acids $HB_{1}$ and $HB_{2}$, then\n$$\npK_{a}(HB_{1}) > pK_{a}(HB_{2}) \\implies B_{1}^{−} \\text{ is a stronger base than } B_{2}^{−}.\n$$\nIdentify the conjugate acids of the given bases:\n- For acetylide $HC\\equiv C^{−}$, the conjugate acid is $HC\\equiv CH$.\n- For ethoxide $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{−}$, the conjugate acid is $CH_{3}CH_{2}OH$.\n- For acetate $CH_{3}COO^{−}$, the conjugate acid is $CH_{3}COOH$.\n\nNow compare acidities qualitatively:\n- $CH_{3}COO^{−}$ is resonance-stabilized over two oxygens, and the negative charge resides on highly electronegative atoms; thus $CH_{3}COOH$ is a relatively strong acid, so $pK_{a}(CH_{3}COOH)$ is the smallest. Therefore, $CH_{3}COO^{−}$ is the weakest base.\n- $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{−}$ has a localized negative charge on oxygen without resonance; oxygen’s high electronegativity stabilizes the charge, making $CH_{3}CH_{2}OH$ more acidic than terminal alkynes but less acidic than carboxylic acids. Hence $pK_{a}(CH_{3}CH_{2}OH)$ is intermediate.\n- $HC\\equiv C^{−}$ has the negative charge on an $\\mathrm{sp}$-hybridized carbon (no resonance). Although $\\mathrm{sp}$ hybridization increases electronegativity relative to $\\mathrm{sp}^3$ carbon, carbon is still less electronegative than oxygen, so the anion is less stabilized than an oxyanion. Consequently, $HC\\equiv CH$ is the weakest acid among the three, so $pK_{a}(HC\\equiv CH)$ is the largest.\n\nThus the $pK_{a}$ ordering is\n$$\npK_{a}(CH_{3}COOH) < pK_{a}(CH_{3}CH_{2}OH) < pK_{a}(HC\\equiv CH),\n$$\nand the corresponding base strength (reverse order of $pK_{a}$) is\n$$\nHC\\equiv C^{−} > CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{−} > CH_{3}COO^{−}.\n$$\nThis matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2190308"}, {"introduction": "Organic molecules often contain multiple potentially acidic protons, and a reaction's outcome depends on which one is removed. The most acidic proton is the one whose removal creates the most stable conjugate base, a principle that is essential for regiochemical control in synthesis. This exercise [@problem_id:2190366] asks you to identify the most acidic proton in a $\\beta$-dicarbonyl compound, a common structural motif in organic chemistry. By evaluating how effectively resonance can delocalize the negative charge upon deprotonation at different sites, you will learn to pinpoint the most reactive location within a complex molecule.", "problem": "Consider the organic molecule 1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione. In this molecule, a butane-1,3-dione chain is substituted at the C-1 position with a phenyl group. The carbon atoms of the dione chain are numbered sequentially from the phenyl-substituted end: C-1 is the carbonyl carbon attached to the phenyl group, C-2 is the methylene carbon, C-3 is the second carbonyl carbon, and C-4 is the terminal methyl carbon.\n\nThe connectivity can be represented as: $\\text{Phenyl-C}_1(=\\text{O})-\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2-\\text{C}_3(=\\text{O})-\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_3$.\n\nBased on the principles of acid-base chemistry, identify which set of protons in the molecule is the most acidic.\n\nA.

Such a carbanion is not effectively stabilized by resonance into the carbonyls of the side chain and does not place negative charge on an electronegative atom. Moreover, generating a phenyl anion disrupts favorable aromatic stabilization and yields a highly unstable conjugate base. Therefore, the aromatic protons (ortho, meta, or para) are far less acidic than the alpha protons of the dione chain.\n\nBy comparing conjugate-base stabilization, the most acidic protons are those at C-2, which are alpha to two carbonyl groups and form a doubly resonance-stabilized enolate.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2190366"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative rankings to practical predictions, we can determine whether a given acid-base reaction will proceed to a significant extent by comparing acid strengths quantitatively.
