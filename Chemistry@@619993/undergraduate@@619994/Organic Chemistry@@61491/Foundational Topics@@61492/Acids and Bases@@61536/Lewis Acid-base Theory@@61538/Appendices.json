In esters, the carbonyl group is conjugated with an alkoxy substituent; resonance donation from the $\\mathrm{OR}$ group into the carbonyl reduces the availability (and raises the delocalization) of the carbonyl oxygen lone pair, lowering its Lewis basicity relative to that of a ketone carbonyl oxygen. Consequently, for a molecule bearing both an ester and a ketone, the ketone carbonyl oxygen is the preferred binding site for a strong oxophilic Lewis acid such as $B(C_{6}F_{5})_{3}$.\n\nUpon coordination of a Lewis acid to a carbonyl oxygen, electron density is withdrawn from the carbonyl group, increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon.
