This first practice explores the leveling effect through a common laboratory scenario: adding a strong acid catalyst to a protic solvent like methanol.

When faced with a mixture of weak bases, the choice of solvent becomes critical for distinguishing them. This problem contrasts a leveling solvent (water) with an acidic, differentiating solvent (glacial acetic acid) to illustrate how a chemist can strategically manipulate the solvent environment to either mask or reveal differences in base strength, enabling a successful quantitative analysis [@problem_id:2211728].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is tasked with determining the individual concentrations of two weak bases, aniline and pyridine, in a single mixture. The proposed method is a potentiometric titration with a solution of a strong acid. The feasibility of this approach hinges on whether two distinct equivalence points can be observed, which requires a significant difference in the apparent basicity of the two compounds in the chosen solvent. Two solvents are under consideration for the titration: deionized water and glacial acetic acid.\n\nIn aqueous solution, the pKa of the conjugate acid of aniline (the anilinium ion, $C_6H_5NH_3^+$) is 4.60, and the pKa of the conjugate acid of pyridine (the pyridinium ion, $C_5H_5NH^+$) is 5.25.\n\nBased on the principles of acid-base chemistry and the leveling effect of solvents, predict which solvent is more likely to allow for the successful differentiation of aniline and pyridine, and select the option that provides the correct reasoning.\n\nA. Water should be used, as its amphiprotic nature allows it to subtly adjust the basicity of each compound, separating their titration curves.\nB. Glacial acetic acid should be used, because as an acidic solvent, it enhances the effective basicities of the two weak bases and differentiates them, allowing the stronger base to be titrated before the weaker one.\nC. Glacial acetic acid should be used, because it is a leveling solvent for bases, causing both aniline and pyridine to behave with the strength of the acetate ion, resulting in one single, sharp, combined equivalence point.\nD. Water should be used, as the difference in the aqueous pKa values (5.25 vs 4.60) is already sufficiently large to guarantee two well-resolved equivalence points in a neutral solvent.\nE. Neither solvent will work, as the intrinsic basicities of aniline and pyridine are too similar for them to ever be differentiated by titration, regardless of the solvent medium.", "solution": "We seek a solvent in which two weak bases, $B_{1}$ (pyridine) and $B_{2}$ (aniline), exhibit sufficiently different apparent basicities so that a potentiometric titration with a strong acid shows two distinct equivalence points. The relevant principle is that, in a given solvent, the effective basicity of $B$ is governed by the acidity of its conjugate acid $BH^{+}$ on that solvent’s acidity scale. Operationally, two equivalence points are resolved when the $pK_{a}$ values of the conjugate acids differ sufficiently in that solvent, i.e.,\n$$\n\\left|pK_{a}^{(\\mathrm{solv})}(B_{1}H^{+})-pK_{a}^{(\\mathrm{solv})}(B_{2}H^{+})\\right|\n$$\nis large (rule of thumb: several $pK_{a}$ units), so that the two neutralization steps occur at well-separated titrant additions and distinct pH (or $- \\log_{10}$ of activity of the solvated proton) values.\n\nThe leveling/differentiating effect dictates how a solvent affects these apparent acidities. For the proton transfer equilibrium between a solvent acid $\\mathrm{SH}$ and a base $B$,\n$$\nB+\\mathrm{SH}\\rightleftharpoons BH^{+}+ \\mathrm{S^{-}},\n$$\nthe equilibrium constant is\n$$\nK=\\frac{[\\mathrm{S^{-}}][BH^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{SH}][B]}=\\frac{K_{a}^{(\\mathrm{solv})}(\\mathrm{SH})}{K_{a}^{(\\mathrm{solv})}(BH^{+})}.\n$$\nThus, for a fixed solvent, a stronger base (larger $pK_{a}^{(\\mathrm{solv})}(BH^{+})$) drives the equilibrium further to the right. A solvent that is more acidic (larger $K_{a}^{(\\mathrm{solv})}(\\mathrm{SH})$) will protonate bases more completely and, crucially, will act as a differentiating medium for bases if it does not level them to a single effective strength. In contrast, a leveling solvent for bases compresses differences among base strengths, making it harder to resolve separate endpoints.\n\nApply these principles:\n\n1) In water, the given aqueous values satisfy $pK_{a}^{(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})}(\\mathrm{PyH^{+}})>pK_{a}^{(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})}(\\mathrm{AniH^{+}})$, so pyridine is the stronger base than aniline. However, the difference $\\Delta pK_{a}^{(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})}$ is small (well below the typical several-unit separation needed), and water is a leveling solvent for bases relative to many organic bases. Therefore, their titration curves with a strong acid in water will overlap significantly, and two distinct equivalence points are unlikely to be resolved. This contradicts options A and D.\n\n2) In glacial acetic acid, the solvent is significantly more acidic and less basic than water. For bases, such an acidic solvent is differentiating rather than leveling: it enhances the observable differences in basicity because $K=\\frac{K_{a}^{(\\mathrm{HOAc})}(\\mathrm{HOAc})}{K_{a}^{(\\mathrm{HOAc})}(BH^{+})}$ varies more strongly with $B$. The stronger base (pyridine) is protonated more favorably and will reach its equivalence point before the weaker base (aniline) upon titration with a strong acid suitable for nonaqueous titration. Hence two distinct endpoints become observable. This supports option B and contradicts option C, which incorrectly asserts that glacial acetic acid levels bases to a single strength.\n\n3) The claim that neither solvent will work (option E) is false because nonaqueous titration in glacial acetic acid is a standard differentiating method for weak organic bases with modest strength differences, precisely enabling resolution of two endpoints.\n\nTherefore, the solvent choice and reasoning that align with acid-base solvent effects are those in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2211728"}]}
