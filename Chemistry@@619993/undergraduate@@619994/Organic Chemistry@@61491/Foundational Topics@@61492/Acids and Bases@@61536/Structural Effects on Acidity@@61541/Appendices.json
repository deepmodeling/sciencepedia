This exercise [@problem_id:2006997] provides a foundational look at this concept by asking you to identify the most acidic proton in propanoic acid. By analyzing the stability of the possible conjugate bases, you will uncover the crucial role of resonance in delocalizing charge, a principle that underpins the characteristic acidity of carboxylic acids.", "problem": "In the structure of propanoic acid, which has the chemical formula $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH}$, there are hydrogen atoms bonded to three distinct environments: the terminal methyl group ($\\text{-CH}_3$), the central methylene group ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$), and the carboxyl group ($\\text{-COOH}$). The acidity of a specific hydrogen atom is determined by the stability of the conjugate base formed after its departure as a proton ($\\text{H}^+$).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the most acidic hydrogen atom in propanoic acid and provides the most accurate and primary chemical justification?\n\nA. A hydrogen on the terminal methyl ($\\text{-CH}_3$) group is the most acidic because its removal is stabilized by the inductive effect of the nearby alkyl chain.\n\nB. A hydrogen on the central methylene ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$) group is the most acidic because this position is most subject to hyperconjugation, which stabilizes the resulting carbanion.\n\nC. The hydrogen on the carboxyl ($\\text{-COOH}$) group is the most acidic because the resulting carboxylate anion ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{COO}^-$) is stabilized by resonance, delocalizing the negative charge over both oxygen atoms.\n\nD. The hydrogen on the carboxyl ($\\text{-COOH}$) group is the most acidic solely because oxygen is highly electronegative, making the O-H bond inherently polar and easy to break.\n\nE. All hydrogen atoms in the molecule have nearly identical acidity, as intramolecular effects on acidity are generally negligible.", "solution": "The operative principle is that the most acidic hydrogen corresponds to the deprotonation that produces the most stabilized conjugate base. For an acid $HA$, acidity increases with increasing $K_{a}$ and decreasing $pK_{a}$, where $K_{a}=\\frac{[A^{-}][H^{+}]}{[HA]}$ and $pK_{a}=-\\log_{10}(K_{a})$. Stabilization of the conjugate base $A^{-}$ by resonance and by placing negative charge on more electronegative atoms lowers its energy and increases acidity.\n\nConsider the three possible deprotonations of $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH}$.\n\n1) Deprotonation at the carboxyl group:\n$$\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{COO}^- + \\text{H}^+.$$\nThe conjugate base $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{COO}^-$ is a carboxylate anion in which the negative charge is delocalized by resonance over two equivalent oxygen atoms:\n$$\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(=\\text{O})\\text{O}^- \\leftrightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(\\text{O}^-)\\text{=O}.$$\nThis delocalization over two equivalent resonance contributors, combined with the negative charge residing on oxygen atoms (more electronegative than carbon), provides substantial stabilization, yielding a relatively large $K_{a}$ and small $pK_{a}$ for the $O\\!-\\!H$ proton.\n\n2) Deprotonation at the central methylene ($\\alpha$ to the carbonyl):\n$$\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH} \\xrightarrow{\\text{deprotonation at } \\text{CH}_2} \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}^-\\text{COOH} + \\text{H}^+.$$\nThe resulting anion is a carbanion adjacent to a carbonyl group. Although there is some resonance interaction with the carbonyl that can delocalize electron density toward oxygen, the resonance contributors are not equivalent and the negative charge is largely located on carbon, which is less electronegative than oxygen. Consequently, the conjugate base is far less stabilized than a carboxylate, and the corresponding $pK_{a}$ is much larger than that of the carboxyl $O\\!-\\!H$.\n\n3) Deprotonation at the terminal methyl:\n$$\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH} \\xrightarrow{\\text{deprotonation at } \\text{CH}_3} \\text{}^-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH} + \\text{H}^+.$$\nThis yields a primary carbanion with no resonance stabilization by the carboxylate group and with the negative charge on carbon. Moreover, alkyl groups exert an electron-donating inductive effect, which destabilizes a carbanion. Hyperconjugation does not provide significant stabilization to a carbanion compared to carbocations or radicals. This site is therefore the least acidic.\n\nFrom these considerations, the hydrogen on the carboxyl group is the most acidic because its removal forms a resonance-stabilized carboxylate where the negative charge is delocalized over two equivalent oxygen atoms. Evaluating the options:\n\n- A is incorrect: methyl C-H acidity is very low, and the inductive effect of an alkyl chain is electron-donating, which destabilizes a carbanion.\n- B is incorrect: hyperconjugation does not primarily stabilize carbanions, and even with some resonance to the carbonyl, the $\\alpha\\text{-C-H}$ is far less acidic than the carboxyl $O\\!-\\!H$.\n- C is correct: it identifies the carboxyl $O\\!-\\!H$ as most acidic and gives the primary justification, resonance delocalization over two oxygens.\n- D is incomplete or misleading: while O is electronegative and the $O\\!-\\!H$ bond is polar, the primary reason for the much greater acidity of carboxylic acids is resonance stabilization of the carboxylate, not electronegativity alone.\n- E is incorrect: intramolecular electronic effects are decisive here; the acidities differ greatly.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the statement emphasizing resonance stabilization of the carboxylate anion formed by deprotonation of the $O\\!-\\!H$ group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2006997"}, {"introduction": "While electronegativity is a useful guide, it is not the only factor governing acidity. This problem [@problem_id:2202999] presents a compelling scenario where you must weigh the 'element effect' (acidity of an N-H bond) against the 'orbital effect' (acidity of an sp-hybridized C-H bond).

Lower $pK_{a}$ corresponds to a more acidic proton. The given reference values in a common solvent are:\n- Typical $sp^3$ C-H (ethane): $pK_{a}\\approx 50$.\n- Typical $sp$ C-H (ethyne): $pK_{a}\\approx 25$.\n- Typical $sp^3$ N-H (ammonia): $pK_{a}\\approx 38$.\n\nWe analyze each site by the stability of its conjugate base:\n1) Deprotonation at the terminal alkyne gives an acetylide anion on an sp-hybridized carbon:\n$$\\mathrm{H_{2}N\\!-\\!CH_{2}\\!-\\!C\\equiv CH} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Base}} \\mathrm{H_{2}N\\!-\\!CH_{2}\\!-\\!C\\equiv C^{-}} + \\mathrm{HB}$$\nAn sp-hybridized carbon has $50\\,\\%$ s-character, so the negative charge resides in a lower-energy, more s-character orbital, which stabilizes the anion. This is the standard rationale for the relatively low $pK_{a}$ of terminal alkynes, $pK_{a}\\approx 25$. In 3-aminoprop-1-yne, the amine is separated from the acetylide by a methylene; there is no effective resonance delocalization into the nitrogen, and inductive effects from the amine (which is weakly electron donating) would, if anything, slightly raise the $pK_{a}$ relative to unsubstituted ethyne, but not enough to surpass the N-H acidity. Thus this site remains the most acidic among the available options.\n\n2) Deprotonation at nitrogen gives an amide-like anion:\n$$\\mathrm{H_{2}N\\!-\\!CH_{2}\\!-\\!C\\equiv CH} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Base}} \\mathrm{H\\!-\\!N^{-}\\!-\\!CH_{2}\\!-\\!C\\equiv CH} + \\mathrm{HB}$$\nFor a typical amine, the N-H $pK_{a}$ is about $pK_{a}\\approx 38$. The nearby alkyne is not conjugated with the lone pair on nitrogen (no direct resonance pathway), and through-bond inductive effects across a methylene are modest. Therefore, the N-H acidity remains far weaker than the terminal alkyne C-H acidity.\n\n3) Deprotonation at the methylene carbon gives a carbanion on an $sp^3$-hybridized carbon:\n$$\\mathrm{H_{2}N\\!-\\!CH_{2}\\!-\\!C\\equiv CH} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Base}} \\mathrm{H_{2}N\\!-\\!CH^{-}\\!-\\!C\\equiv CH} + \\mathrm{HB}$$\nTypical $sp^3$ C-H bonds (e.g., in alkanes) have $pK_{a}\\approx 50$, reflecting the poor stability of an $sp^3$ carbanion. The adjacent alkyne may offer slight inductive stabilization, but without direct resonance delocalization, this effect is small; the methylene C-H remains the least acidic of the three sites.\n\nComparing the approximate $pK_{a}$ values:\n- $sp$ C-H (terminal alkyne): $pK_{a}\\approx 25$ (most acidic).\n- $sp^3$ N-H (amine): $pK_{a}\\approx 38$ (less acidic).\n- $sp^3$ C-H (methylene): $pK_{a}\\approx 50$ (least acidic).\n\nTherefore, the most acidic proton is the terminal alkyne proton with $pK_{a}\\approx 25$, which corresponds to option B.
