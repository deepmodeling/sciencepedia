{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Hammond Postulate provides a powerful conceptual bridge between the thermodynamics of a reaction and the structure of its transition state. This first exercise [@problem_id:1519068] applies the postulate to a classic textbook example: the thermal isomerization of cyclopropane to propene. This reaction is exothermic, releasing energy as the strained three-membered ring opens to form a more stable alkene. By applying the postulate, you will predict whether the transition state more closely resembles the high-energy reactant or the low-energy product.", "problem": "The thermal isomerization of cyclopropane to propene is a classic example of a unimolecular gas-phase reaction. The overall process is exothermic, meaning the product (propene) is at a lower energy level than the reactant (cyclopropane). Based on this thermodynamic information, which of the following statements best describes the expected geometry of the reaction's transition state?\n\nA. The transition state closely resembles cyclopropane, with the triangular C-C-C framework largely preserved and all C-C bonds having similar lengths.\n\nB. The transition state closely resembles propene, with one of the original C-C bonds almost completely broken and significant C=C double bond character established.\n\nC. The geometry of the transition state is exactly halfway between that of cyclopropane and propene, representing a perfect symmetrical average of the reactant and product structures.\n\nD. The transition state is characterized by the formation of a temporary, planar four-membered carbon ring intermediate before it opens to form propene.", "solution": "We are asked to infer the geometry of the transition state (TS) for the unimolecular, gas-phase isomerization of cyclopropane to propene, given that the overall process is exothermic. Let the reactants and products have energies denoted by $E_{\\text{R}}$ and $E_{\\text{P}}$, respectively, and the transition state have energy $E^{\\ddagger}$. The condition that the reaction is exothermic is expressed as\n$$\n\\Delta H = E_{\\text{P}} - E_{\\text{R}}  0,\n$$\nso that $E_{\\text{P}}  E_{\\text{R}}$.\n\nAccording to the Hammond postulate, the structure of the transition state resembles the structure of the species (reactant or product) to which it is closer in energy. For an exothermic reaction, $E^{\\ddagger}$ is closer to $E_{\\text{R}}$ than to $E_{\\text{P}}$, so the TS is expected to be reactant-like in both energy and structure. Applied to the cyclopropane to propene ring opening, a reactant-like TS implies that the triangular C-C-C framework of cyclopropane is largely preserved, with one C-C bond only slightly stretched. The geometry has not yet significantly progressed towards the open-chain structure of propene.\n\nBy this reasoning:\n- Option A (reactant-like TS preserving the triangular framework) is consistent with the Hammond postulate for an exothermic reaction.\n- Option B (product-like TS resembling propene) contradicts the Hammond postulate for an exothermic reaction.\n- Option C (exactly halfway geometry) is not generally valid; the Hammond postulate predicts resemblance based on relative energies, not an exact geometric midpoint.\n- Option D (a planar four-membered ring intermediate) describes an incorrect mechanism and is irrelevant.\n\nThus, the correct description is that the TS is reactant-like, closely resembling cyclopropane.
