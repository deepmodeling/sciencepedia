This analysis reveals how TST bridges the gap between statistical mechanics and kinetic observations. [@problem_id:2027432]", "problem": "According to Transition State Theory (also known as Activated Complex Theory), a chemical reaction proceeds through the formation of a short-lived high-energy species called the activated complex. Consider a gas-phase bimolecular association reaction where two identical, non-linear polyatomic molecules, denoted by $A$, combine to form a single, non-linear activated complex, denoted by $A_2^{\\ddagger}$:\n\n$$2A(g) \\rightarrow A_2^{\\ddagger}(g)$$\n\nThe standard entropy of activation, $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$, is defined as the difference between the standard molar entropy of the activated complex and the sum of the standard molar entropies of the reactants. Based on a qualitative analysis of the molecular degrees of freedom, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected sign of $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ and provides the correct physical reasoning?\n\nA. $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ will be negative. The formation of one activated complex from two reactant molecules results in a net loss of three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom. This leads to a significant decrease in entropy, as translational and rotational entropy contributions are generally large. The conversion of these modes into six new vibrational modes in the activated complex only partially compensates for this loss.\n\nB. $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ will be positive. Although translational degrees of freedom are lost, the activated complex is a larger, more complex molecule with many more low-frequency vibrational modes than the individual reactants. The significant increase in vibrational entropy outweighs the loss of translational and rotational entropy.\n\nC. $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ will be approximately zero. The loss of three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom is almost perfectly compensated by the formation of six new vibrational degrees of freedom. The entropy contributions from these different types of motion effectively cancel each other out for this type of reaction.\n\nD. $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ will be negative. The primary reason is that the formation of a chemical bond is an inherently ordering process that localizes electrons and nuclei. This localization always corresponds to a decrease in entropy, regardless of the changes in molecular degrees of freedom.\n\nE. The sign of $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ cannot be determined without knowing the specific vibrational frequencies and moments of inertia of both the reactants and the activated complex. The balance between the loss of rotation/translation and the gain of vibration is too sensitive to these details to make a general prediction.", "solution": "In Transition State Theory, the standard entropy of activation is defined as\n$$\n\\Delta S^{\\ddagger} = S^{\\circ}(A_{2}^{\\ddagger}) - 2 S^{\\circ}(A).\n$$\nThe standard molar entropy is the sum of translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic contributions. For gas-phase non-linear molecules at typical temperatures, the dominant changes between reactants and the activated complex arise from translation, rotation, and vibration; electronic contributions are usually unchanged and can be neglected in a qualitative comparison.\n\nFor a non-linear molecule with $n$ atoms, the numbers of classical degrees of freedom are: $3$ translational, $3$ rotational, and $3n - 6$ vibrational. Thus:\n- Two separate non-linear molecules $A$ have in total $6$ translational and $6$ rotational degrees of freedom.\n- A single non-linear activated complex $A_{2}^{\\ddagger}$ has $3$ translational and $3$ rotational degrees of freedom.\n\nTherefore, upon forming the activated complex from two separate molecules, there is a net loss of $3$ translational and $3$ rotational degrees of freedom. The vibrational degrees of freedom increase because the complex has more atoms and internal couplings. Indeed, relative to the sum of the two separate molecules, the number of vibrational modes increases by\n$$\n\\left[3(2n) - 6\\right] - 2(3n - 6) = 6,\n$$\ncorresponding to the three relative translations and three relative rotations that become internal modes in the bound complex. In TST, one of the complex’s vibrational modes along the reaction coordinate is unstable and treated separately, so the number of stable vibrational modes is effectively reduced by one, but this only strengthens the conclusion below.\n\nThe entropy change is governed by the magnitudes of the mode-specific entropies. The translational molar entropy for an ideal gas has the form\n$$\nS_{\\text{trans}} \\sim R \\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{(2 \\pi m k_{B} T)^{3/2} k_{B} T}{p h^{3}}\\right) + \\frac{5}{2}\\right],\n$$\nwhich is typically large and positive under standard conditions. Rotational entropy for a non-linear rotor similarly contains a logarithmic dependence on $T^{3/2}$ and the principal moments of inertia, yielding a substantial positive contribution. By contrast, vibrational entropy per mode is given by\n$$\nS_{\\text{vib},i} = R\\left[\\frac{\\theta_{i}/T}{\\exp(\\theta_{i}/T)-1} - \\ln\\!\\left(1 - \\exp(-\\theta_{i}/T)\\right)\\right],\n$$\nwhich is modest unless the frequency is very low (i.e., small $\\theta_{i}$). Although the activated complex gains approximately six additional vibrational modes relative to the separated reactants, these modes do not, in general, supply enough entropy to compensate for the large loss of three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom when two freely translating and rotating molecules become one entity. Consequently,\n$$\n\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}  0.\n$$\nThis conclusion is further reinforced for identical reactants by the indistinguishability factor that enters the TST rate expression, effectively introducing an additional $-R \\ln 2$ contribution to the activation entropy under standard-state conventions. Therefore, the best qualitative statement is that $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ is negative because the substantial loss of translational and rotational entropy dominates over the increase in vibrational entropy.\n\nThis matches option A: it correctly identifies the loss of three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom and explains that the corresponding six new vibrational modes only partially compensate, leading to a negative $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2027432"}]}
