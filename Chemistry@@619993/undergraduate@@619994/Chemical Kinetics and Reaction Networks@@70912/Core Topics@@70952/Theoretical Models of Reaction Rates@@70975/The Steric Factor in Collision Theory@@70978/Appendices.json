The steric factor is a dimensionless quantity, typically between 0 and 1, that accounts for the fact that not all collisions with sufficient energy lead to a reaction; a specific relative orientation between the colliding molecules is often required.\n\nConsider the following two elementary gas-phase radical reactions:\n\n**Reaction I:** The recombination of two methyl radicals to form ethane.\n$$2 \\text{ CH}_3\\cdot \\rightarrow \\text{C}_2\\text{H}_6$$\n\n**Reaction II:** The reaction of a tert-butyl radical with a diatomic oxygen molecule to form a tert-butylperoxy radical.\n$$(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{C}\\cdot + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow (\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{COO}\\cdot$$\n\nLet $P_I$ and $P_{II}$ be the steric factors for Reaction I and Reaction II, respectively. Based on your understanding of molecular structure and steric hindrance, which of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison of these two factors?\n\nA. $P_{II} < P_I$, because the central carbon atom in the tert-butyl radical is sterically shielded by three bulky methyl groups, severely restricting the successful collisional orientation with the oxygen molecule.\n\nB. $P_I < P_{II}$, because the collision of two relatively large methyl radicals requires a more specific orientation than the collision of a large radical with a small, point-like oxygen molecule.\n\nC. $P_{II} < P_I$, because the oxygen molecule is diatomic and its linear shape makes it a difficult target for the tert-butyl radical to strike in the correct orientation to form a bond.\n\nD. $P_I = P_{II}$, because both reactions involve a radical center reacting with another atom (carbon in Reaction I, oxygen in Reaction II), making the geometric requirements for bond formation fundamentally similar.\n\nE. $P_I < P_{II}$, because the methyl radical is planar, meaning reactive collisions can only occur from two directions (above or below the plane), whereas the tert-butyl radical is non-planar, allowing for a wider range of successful attack angles.", "solution": "We begin with the collision-theory expression for a bimolecular gas-phase rate constant:\n$$\nk = P\\,Z\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $Z$ is the collision frequency, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $P$ is the steric factor. The steric factor $P$ quantifies the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy that also have a productive relative orientation. A useful way to conceptualize $P$ is as the fraction of orientation space that is reactive:\n$$\nP \\propto \\frac{\\Omega_{\\text{react}}}{4\\pi},\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega_{\\text{react}}$ is the solid angle corresponding to orientations that lead to reaction at the reactive site.\n\nFor Reaction I, $2\\,\\text{CH}_{3}\\cdot \\rightarrow \\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{6}$, the reactive centers are two methyl radicals. The methyl radical center is relatively accessible: the unpaired electron resides in a $p$ orbital on the carbon of a small radical, and the steric hindrance around the radical center is minimal. Consequently, a broad range of approach orientations can allow effective overlap to form the new C–C bond. Thus $\\Omega_{\\text{react}}$ is relatively large and $P_{I}$ is comparatively high.\n\nFor Reaction II, $(\\text{CH}_{3})_{3}\\text{C}\\cdot + \\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow (\\text{CH}_{3})_{3}\\text{COO}\\cdot$, the reactive center is a tertiary carbon radical shielded by three methyl groups. The approach of $\\text{O}_{2}$ to the radical center is sterically encumbered, substantially reducing the accessible approach solid angle. Hence $\\Omega_{\\text{react}}$ is smaller and therefore $P_{II}$ is lower than $P_{I}$:\n$$\nP_{II} < P_{I}.\n$$\nThis inequality arises primarily from steric shielding at the tert-butyl radical center, not from the linear shape of $\\text{O}_{2}$. The linearity of $\\text{O}_{2}$ does not, by itself, impose a more severe orientational constraint than the crowding at the tertiary center, and $\\text{O}_{2}$ is not a point-like species. Moreover, the planarity of the methyl radical does not restrict reactive approach to only two directions; the $p$ orbital has lobes above and below the plane, and small size plus minimal crowding affords many productive orientations. Therefore, among the provided statements, the one that correctly attributes the lower steric factor in Reaction II to steric shielding by the three methyl groups is the most accurate.\n\nThus, the most accurate comparison is $P_{II} < P_{I}$ for the steric reason stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1524457"}, {"introduction": "Now that we have a qualitative sense of the steric factor, let's explore its quantitative power.
