The key contributions are:\n\n- Translational entropy: For two separate molecules in the gas phase, the translational partition function scales as the volume for each particle, so the combined translational contribution scales as $V^{2}$; for the single activated complex, it scales as $V^{1}$. The reduction from two independent translational degrees of freedom to one leads to a large decrease in entropy upon forming the activated complex.\n\n- Rotational and orientational constraints: To achieve the concerted, cyclic, Diels-Alder transition state, the two reactant molecules must adopt a specific relative orientation and approach distance, which restricts rotational and orientational freedom relative to the freely tumbling reactants. This further lowers the entropy of the activated complex relative to the separated reactants.\n\n- Vibrational modes: Although new vibrational modes appear in the activated complex, any increase in vibrational entropy is generally small and is outweighed by the substantial losses in translational and rotational entropy due to association and ordering.\n\nTherefore, the net effect for this bimolecular association with a highly ordered, cyclic transition state is $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}0$.
