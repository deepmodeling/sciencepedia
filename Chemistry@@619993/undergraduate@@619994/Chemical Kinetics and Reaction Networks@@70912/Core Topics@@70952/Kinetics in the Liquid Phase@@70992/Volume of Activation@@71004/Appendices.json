This final practice presents a common scenario where the experimental $\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}$ seems to contradict a simple structural model of the transition state. Your task is to dissect this apparent paradox, moving beyond simple bond-making or bond-breaking to consider the crucial role of the solvent in the overall volume change. [@problem_id:1529796]", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, the volume of activation, $\\Delta V^\\ddagger$, is a powerful tool for elucidating reaction mechanisms. It is defined as the difference between the partial molar volume of the transition state and the sum of the partial molar volumes of the reactants. A chemist is investigating the kinetics of a ligand substitution reaction in a polar aqueous solution, represented by the following general equation:\n\n$$ [\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_5(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})]^{3+} + \\text{X}^- \\rightarrow [\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_5\\text{X}]^{2+} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\n\nWhere $\\text{X}^-$ is an incoming anionic ligand. The chemist hypothesizes that the reaction proceeds via an associative interchange ($I_a$) mechanism, where the bond to the incoming ligand $\\text{X}^-$ begins to form before the bond to the leaving water molecule is significantly broken. In such a mechanism, the coordination number increases in the transition state.\n\nHowever, upon measuring the rate constant at various pressures, the experimental volume of activation is determined to be $\\Delta V^\\ddagger = +14.0 \\text{ cm}^3\\text{mol}^{-1}$. This large, positive value appears to contradict the proposed associative mechanism, for which one would typically expect a negative volume of activation due to the formation of a more compact, higher-coordinate transition state.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most physically sound explanation for this apparent contradiction?\n\nA. The large positive volume of activation definitively proves the mechanism is dissociative ($D$), where the rate-determining step is the cleavage of the Co-OH$_2$ bond, which occurs prior to any interaction with the incoming ligand $\\text{X}^-$.\n\nB. In forming the seven-coordinate transition state, the extreme steric crowding forces all ligands to move further from the central cobalt ion, causing a large expansion of the intrinsic volume of the complex that dominates the volume change.\n\nC. The formation of the transition state involves the partial neutralization of charge between the reacting ions ($+3$ and $-1$). This reduction in net charge density leads to a significant relaxation and release of the highly ordered solvent molecules (electrostriction) around the reactants. This increase in the solvent's volume is the dominant contribution to the overall volume of activation.\n\nD. The volume of activation is primarily determined by electronic factors. The formation of a new bond in the transition state requires promoting an electron to a high-energy, diffuse anti-bonding orbital, whose large volume accounts for the positive $\\Delta V^\\ddagger$.", "solution": "The volume of activation is defined thermodynamically as the pressure derivative of the activation Gibbs energy at constant temperature:\n$$\n\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}=\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{\\partial p}\\right)_{T}.\n$$\nUsing the Eyring equation for a unimolecular elementary step,\n$$\nk=\\kappa \\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\ntaking the natural logarithm and differentiating with respect to pressure at constant temperature gives\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln k}{\\partial p}\\right)_{T}=-\\frac{\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}}{RT}.\n$$\nThus a positive $\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}$ implies that increasing pressure decreases the rate, meaning that formation of the transition state is accompanied by an increase in the partial molar volume.\n\nThe microscopic decomposition of the activation volume separates intrinsic (solute structural) and solvation contributions:\n$$\n\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}=\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{int}}+\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{solv}},\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{int}}=\\bar{V}_{\\text{TS,int}}-\\sum \\bar{V}_{\\text{reactants,int}}\n$$\nis the change in the intrinsic partial molar volume of the solute complex, and\n$$\n\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{solv}}=\\bar{V}_{\\text{TS,solv}}-\\sum \\bar{V}_{\\text{reactants,solv}}\n$$\ncaptures the change in solvent (hydration) contribution due to reorganization and electrostriction.\n\nFor an associative interchange ($I_{a}$) mechanism, the intrinsic contribution is typically negative because the coordination number increases in the transition state and the solute complex becomes more compact, i.e., $\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{int}}<0$. However, in a polar aqueous medium with highly charged reactants, the solvation term can dominate. The separated reactants, $[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_{3})_{5}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})]^{3+}$ and $\\text{X}^{-}$, each possess strong electric fields that induce electrostriction, reducing the local solvent volume around them (more negative solvation volume). In the transition state of an $I_{a}$ process, the incoming anion is partially associated with the cationic complex, reducing the local charge density and electric field. This partial neutralization relaxes the electrostricted solvent, releasing structured water and increasing the solvent’s volume.
