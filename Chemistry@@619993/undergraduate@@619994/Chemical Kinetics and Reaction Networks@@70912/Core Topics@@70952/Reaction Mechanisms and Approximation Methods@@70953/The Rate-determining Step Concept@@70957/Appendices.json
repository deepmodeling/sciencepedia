This introductory practice [@problem_id:1522945] provides a foundational exercise in identifying the RDS by comparing the activation energies ($E_a$) of consecutive steps. Understanding this direct relationship between the highest energy barrier and the slowest kinetic rate is the first crucial skill in analyzing multi-step reactions.", "problem": "In a research project aimed at developing a novel catalytic converter, a chemical engineering team is studying a simplified model for the conversion of a pollutant molecule, $P$, into a harmless product, $H$. The proposed reaction mechanism consists of three consecutive elementary steps occurring on the catalyst surface:\n\n1.  Adsorption and initial transformation: $P \\rightarrow I_1$\n2.  Surface rearrangement: $I_1 \\rightarrow I_2$\n3.  Final conversion and desorption: $I_2 \\rightarrow H$\n\nHere, $I_1$ and $I_2$ represent transient intermediate species. Using computational quantum chemistry methods, the team has calculated the activation energy barriers for these three elementary steps at the target operating temperature. The values are $E_{a,1} = 45 \\text{ kJ/mol}$, $E_{a,2} = 110 \\text{ kJ/mol}$, and $E_{a,3} = 60 \\text{ kJ/mol}$, respectively.\n\nAssuming the pre-exponential factors in the Arrhenius equation are of a similar order of magnitude for all three steps, which of the following statements most accurately describes the overall rate of conversion of the pollutant $P$ to the product $H$?\n\nA. The overall rate of conversion is primarily dictated by the rate of the first step ($P \\rightarrow I_1$).\nB.

The overall rate of conversion is primarily dictated by the rate of the third step ($I_2 \\rightarrow H$).\nD. The overall rate of conversion is best approximated by the arithmetic average of the rates of the three individual steps.\nE. All three elementary steps have a comparable influence on the overall rate of conversion.", "solution": "We analyze the kinetics of three consecutive, irreversible elementary steps on a catalyst surface:\n1. $P \\rightarrow I_{1}$ with rate constant $k_{1}$,\n2. $I_{1} \\rightarrow I_{2}$ with rate constant $k_{2}$,\n3. $I_{2} \\rightarrow H$ with rate constant $k_{3}$.\n\nFor each elementary step, the Arrhenius equation gives\n$$\nk_{i} = A_{i}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,i}}{R T}\\right), \\quad i \\in \\{1,2,3\\},\n$$\nwhere $A_{i}$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{a,i}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem states that $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}$ are of a similar order of magnitude, so differences in $k_{i}$ are dominated by the exponential terms.\n\nThe given activation energies satisfy\n$$\nE_{a,2} > E_{a,3} > E_{a,1}.\n$$\nBecause the function $\\exp(-x)$ is strictly decreasing in $x$, it follows that\n$$\nk_{2}  k_{3}  k_{1}.\n$$\n\nFor a series of consecutive irreversible steps, when one step is much slower than the others (i.e., has the smallest $k_{i}$), it acts as the rate-determining step: the steady-state flux through the sequence is bottlenecked by this slowest step, while the faster steps rapidly adjust intermediate coverages upstream and downstream. Equivalently, one may view each step as contributing a characteristic time $\\tau_{i} \\approx k_{i}^{-1}$; the largest $\\tau_{i}$ dominates the mean passage time, so the effective overall rate is governed by the smallest $k_{i}$. Since $k_{2}$ is the smallest, the second step controls the overall rate.\n\nTherefore, the overall rate of conversion is primarily dictated by the rate of the second step $I_{1} \\rightarrow I_{2}$, making option B correct. Options A and C are incorrect because their steps have smaller activation barriers (thus larger $k_{i}$) than step 2. Option D is not appropriate for series kinetics, where a single bottleneck controls the flux rather than an arithmetic average of rates. Option E is not accurate here because the substantial difference in activation energies implies non-comparable rate constants.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1522945"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are powerful, but how do chemists get experimental evidence to pinpoint the rate-determining step?
