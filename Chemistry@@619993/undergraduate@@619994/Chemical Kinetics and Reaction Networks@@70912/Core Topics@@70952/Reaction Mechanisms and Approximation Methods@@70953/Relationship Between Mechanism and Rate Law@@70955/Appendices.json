The proposal is correct because the reactants in the rate law, A and B, are the same as the reactants in the overall reaction equation.\n\nB. The proposal is incorrect. A single-step mechanism would require a rate law of $rate = k[A][B]^2$, which contradicts the experimental findings.\n\nC. The proposal is correct. The experimentally determined order for B (first-order) is simply an apparent order, and the true mechanism involves two molecules of B as indicated by the stoichiometry.\n\nD. The proposal is incorrect because the rate of a reaction can never be dependent on the concentration of a reactant with a stoichiometric coefficient of 2.\n\nE.

Therefore, the proposal of a single-step mechanism corresponding to the overall stoichiometry is inconsistent with the data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely matching reactants does not validate an elementary mechanism. Option C is incorrect because invoking an “apparent” first order in $B$ does not reconcile a single elementary step that would require second order in $B$. Option D is false because a reaction rate can depend on a reactant with stoichiometric coefficient $2$ in an elementary step as $[B]^{2}$. Option E is incorrect because if $B$ were a catalyst it would not be consumed overall, contradicting the net reaction showing consumption of $2B$, and it does not rescue the single-step prediction $[B]^{2}$.\n\nHence, the most accurate assessment is that the proposal is incorrect for the reason stated in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1509218"}, {"introduction": "Many reactions involve short-lived intermediates whose concentrations are too low to measure directly.
