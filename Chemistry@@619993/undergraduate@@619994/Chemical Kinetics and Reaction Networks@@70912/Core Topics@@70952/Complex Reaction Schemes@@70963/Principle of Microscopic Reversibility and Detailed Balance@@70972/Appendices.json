After allowing the system to reach equilibrium in a closed reactor at a constant temperature, experimental measurements of the partial pressures are taken.

The rate of the forward reaction depends on the concentrations (or partial pressures) of the reactants, and the rate of the reverse reaction depends on the concentrations (or partial pressures) of the products. Let $P_A$, $P_B$, and $P_C$ represent the partial pressures of species A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nThe forward rate law is:\n$$R_f = k_f P_A^2 P_B$$\nThe reverse rate law is:\n$$R_r = k_r P_C^3$$\n\nAt equilibrium, we equate these two rates. Let the subscript 'eq' denote equilibrium partial pressures.\n$$k_f (P_{A,eq})^2 P_{B,eq} = k_r (P_{C,eq})^3$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\frac{k_f}{k_r}$. We can rearrange the equation above to solve for this ratio:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{(P_{C,eq})^3}{(P_{A,eq})^2 P_{B,eq}}$$\nThis ratio is also known as the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of partial pressures, $K_p$.\n\nNext, we use the specific relationships between the equilibrium partial pressures given in the problem statement.\n1. The partial pressure of species $A$ is twice that of species $B$: $P_{A,eq} = 2 P_{B,eq}$.\n2. The partial pressure of species $C$ is four times that of species $B$: $P_{C,eq} = 4 P_{B,eq}$.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, let's introduce a variable $p$ to represent the equilibrium partial pressure of species $B$, so $P_{B,eq} = p$.\nUsing this, we can express the other equilibrium partial pressures in terms of $p$:\n$$P_{A,eq} = 2p$$\n$$P_{C,eq} = 4p$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into our equation for the ratio of the rate constants:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{(4p)^3}{(2p)^2 (p)}$$\n\nLet's simplify the expression by evaluating the powers:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{64p^3}{(4p^2)(p)}$$\n\nNow, combine the terms in the denominator:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{64p^3}{4p^3}$$\n\nFinally, we cancel the $p^3$ term from the numerator and the denominator and perform the division:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{64}{4} = 16$$\n\nThus, the numerical value of the ratio of the forward rate constant to the reverse rate constant is 16.
