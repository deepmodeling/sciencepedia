Other options are not definitive in this context: extending inhibitor concentration ranges of steady-state rates cannot discriminate reversibility, varying substrate concentration classifies inhibition modality but not reversibility, mass spectrometry may fail to detect labile or partial adducts or be confounded by noncovalent associations and thus is less universally definitive than the functional reversibility test, and temperature dependence does not uniquely report on covalency versus reversibility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1510540"}]}
