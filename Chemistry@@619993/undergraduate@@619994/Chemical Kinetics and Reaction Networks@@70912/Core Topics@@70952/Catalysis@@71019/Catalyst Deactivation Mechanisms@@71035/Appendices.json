Sintering, the agglomeration of small catalyst particles into larger ones at high temperatures, leads to a loss of active surface area. This practice explores a common model for sintering where the rate of activity loss is second-order with respect to the active area. By solving this kinetic model, you will gain a deeper understanding of how the rate of deactivation changes over time and why the concept of a \"half-life\" for a catalyst is more complex than for a simple first-order process [@problem_id:1474143].", "problem": "A platinum-based catalyst is used in a high-temperature industrial process. Over time, its performance degrades due to the thermal sintering of the platinum nanoparticles, which reduces the total active surface area available for the reaction.
