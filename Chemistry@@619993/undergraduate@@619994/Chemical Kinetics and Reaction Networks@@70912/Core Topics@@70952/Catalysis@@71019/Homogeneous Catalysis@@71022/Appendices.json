In uncompetitive inhibition, both $K_{M}$ and $V_{\\max}$ decrease by the same factor, keeping the slope $K_{M}/V_{\\max}$ constant and producing parallel lines with different $y$-intercepts. An activator would alter $V_{\\max}$ and/or $K_{M}$ in ways not consistent with the specific signature of same $y$-intercept and different slope attributed to competitive inhibition.
