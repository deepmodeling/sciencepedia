The key mechanistic distinction is how $k_{obs}$ depends on solution composition at fixed pH.\n\nUnder specific acid catalysis (SAC), only hydronium acts as the catalyst. The rate law is\n$v = k_{H^+} a_{H^+} [S]$,\nso\n$k_{obs} = k_{H^+} a_{H^+}$.\nAt fixed pH (i.e., fixed $a_{H^+}$), $k_{obs}$ is independent of the buffer identity and of the concentrations of buffer components.\n\nUnder general acid catalysis (GAC), proton donors other than hydronium contribute (e.g., undissociated weak acids $\\text{HA}_{i}$). The rate law becomes\n$v = \\left(k_{H^+} a_{H^+} + \\sum_{i}k_{i} [\\text{HA}_{i}]\\right)[S]$,\nso\n$k_{obs} = k_{H^+} a_{H^+} + \\sum_{i}k_{i} [\\text{HA}_{i}]$.\nAt fixed pH in a single buffer $\\text{HA}/\\text{A}^-$, the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation $\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right)$ implies that keeping the ratio $[\\text{A}^-]/[\\text{HA}]$ constant fixes pH, while changing the total buffer concentration $C_{\\text{buf}} = [\\text{HA}] + [\\text{A}^-]$ scales $[\\text{HA}]$ proportionally:\n$[\\text{HA}] = \\frac{C_{\\text{buf}}}{1+10^{\\text{pH}-\\text{p}K_a}}$.\nTherefore, in GAC, $k_{obs}$ increases linearly with $C_{\\text{buf}}$ at constant pH; in SAC, it does not change with $C_{\\text{buf}}$.\n\nUsing these principles:\n\nA. Measuring activation energy via an Arrhenius plot at fixed pH cannot unambiguously distinguish SAC from GAC. In SAC, $k_{obs} = A_{1}\\exp(-E_{a,1}/(R T))$; in GAC, $k_{obs}$ is a sum of Arrhenius-type terms, $k_{obs} = A_{1}\\exp(-E_{a,1}/(R T)) + A_{2}\\exp(-E_{a,2}/(R T))$ (with $A_{2} \\propto [\\text{HA}]$ at fixed pH). Depending on temperature range and dominance of one term, the plot can appear linear with an apparent activation energy that does not uniquely diagnose mechanism. Not unambiguous.\n\nB. Varying the total buffer concentration $C_{\\text{buf}}$ at fixed pH and fixed $[\\text{A}^-]/[\\text{HA}]$ is diagnostic. In SAC, $k_{obs}$ is constant because it depends only on $a_{H^+}$. In GAC, $k_{obs}$ varies linearly with $C_{\\text{buf}}$ via the $\\sum k_{i}[\\text{HA}_{i}]$ term. This unambiguously distinguishes SAC (no buffer-concentration dependence) from GAC (positive buffer-concentration dependence).\n\nC. Varying $[S]$ at fixed pH and buffer concentration only reaffirms the given first-order dependence on substrate. Both SAC and GAC predict $v \\propto [S]$ under the stated conditions, so this does not distinguish mechanisms.\n\nD. Using different weak acid buffers at the same pH is diagnostic. In SAC, $k_{obs}$ depends only on $a_{H^+}$, so keeping pH the same across buffers gives the same $k_{obs}$ (neglecting minor medium effects). In GAC, $k_{obs}$ depends on both $[\\text{HA}]$ and the intrinsic $k_{i}$ of the acid; at the same pH and fixed total buffer concentration, $[\\text{HA}]$ differs with $\\text{p}K_a$ via $[\\text{HA}]=C_{\\text{buf}}/(1+10^{\\text{pH}-\\text{p}K_a})$, and $k_{i}$ generally correlates with acid strength (Brønsted-type dependence, i.e., a nonzero slope in a plot of $\\log_{10} k_{obs}$ versus $\\text{p}K_a$). Thus, rates change with buffer identity in GAC but not in SAC. This unambiguously distinguishes the mechanisms.\n\nE. Comparing rates in $0.1$ M with a strong acid versus $0.1$ M of a weak acid is not diagnostic because the pH values differ substantially. Any rate difference can arise solely from different $a_{H^+}$ under SAC. Without controlling pH, one cannot unambiguously ascribe differences to general acid catalysis.\n\nTherefore, procedures B and D allow an unambiguous distinction between specific and general acid catalysis for this reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "1513290"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we apply our knowledge to a common task in chemical kinetics: determining the underlying catalytic rate constants from experimental data.
