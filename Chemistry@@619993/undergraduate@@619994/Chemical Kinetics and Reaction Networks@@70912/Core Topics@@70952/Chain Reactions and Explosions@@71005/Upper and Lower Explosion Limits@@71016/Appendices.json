This practice challenges you to move beyond simple derivations and apply your conceptual understanding to the classic hydrogen-oxygen system [@problem_id:1528987]. You will investigate how changing the mixture from hydrogen-rich to oxygen-rich shifts the explosion limits, highlighting the crucial role that different molecules play as 'third bodies' in terminating chain reactions.", "id": "1528987", "problem": "In the study of combustion chemistry, the hydrogen-oxygen reaction system is a canonical example of a chain-branching reaction that exhibits explosive behavior under certain conditions of pressure and temperature. This explosive region is often visualized as an \"explosion peninsula\" on a pressure-temperature plot. An explosion occurs when the rate of chain-branching reactions, which produce radicals, exceeds the rate of chain-termination reactions, which consume them.\n\nConsider the following simplified key reactions that govern the explosion limits at a fixed temperature:\n\n1.  **Chain Branching:** `H + O2 -> OH + O`\n2.  **Wall Termination (dominant at low pressures):** `H` radicals are removed upon collision with the vessel walls. The rate of this process is limited by the diffusion of radicals to the wall.\n3.  **Gas-Phase Termination (dominant at intermediate pressures):** `H + O2 + M -> HO2 + M`, where `M` is any third body (e.g., H2 or O2). The `HO2` radical is relatively unreactive and its formation is considered a termination step.\n\nA laboratory is comparing the explosive behavior of a hydrogen-rich mixture (Mixture 1) to an oxygen-rich mixture (Mixture 2) at the same constant temperature. It is known that for the gas-phase termination reaction, oxygen (O2) is a more effective third body (`M`) than hydrogen (H2).\n\nBased on this information, how do the lower and upper pressure boundaries of the explosion peninsula for the oxygen-rich mixture (Mixture 2) compare to those for the hydrogen-rich mixture (Mixture 1)?\n\nA. Both the lower and upper pressure limits will increase.\nB. Both the lower and upper pressure limits will decrease.\nC. The lower pressure limit will decrease, and the upper pressure limit will increase.\nD. The lower pressure limit will increase, and the upper pressure limit will decrease.\nE. The pressure limits will remain unchanged as they are only dependent on temperature and vessel size.\n\n", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine how the first (lower) and second (upper) explosion pressure limits for the H2/O2 reaction change when the composition is shifted from hydrogen-rich to oxygen-rich. The explosion limits are defined by the pressures at which the rate of chain branching equals the rate of chain termination.\n\n**Analysis of the Lower Explosion Limit (First Limit)**\n\nAt very low pressures, the mean free path of gas molecules is long, and radicals are more likely to reach and be deactivated by the vessel walls before they can react with other gas molecules. The explosion is initiated when the rate of chain branching overcomes this wall termination.\n\nThe key branching step given is `H + O2 -> OH + O`. The rate of this reaction is given by `Rate_branch = k_b [H][O2]`.\nThe termination step is the diffusion of H radicals to the wall. The rate of this process, `Rate_term_wall`, is proportional to the concentration of H radicals, `[H]`. Importantly, the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the total pressure `P_total`, so the rate of termination at the wall is inversely proportional to pressure. We can write `Rate_term_wall = k_w [H]`, where the effective rate constant `k_w` is proportional to `1/P_total`.\n\nThe lower explosion limit, `P_1`, occurs when `Rate_branch = Rate_term_wall`.\n$$ k_b [H][O2] = k_w [H] $$\n$$ k_b [O2] = k_w $$\nSince `k_w \\propto 1/P_1`, we have `k_b [O2] \\propto 1/P_1`.\nThe concentration of oxygen, `[O2]`, can be expressed using the ideal gas law as `[O2] = x_{O2} P_1 / (RT)`, where `x_{O2}` is the mole fraction of O2.\nSubstituting this into our relation:\n$$ k_b \\left( \\frac{x_{O2} P_1}{RT} \\right) \\propto \\frac{1}{P_1} $$\nRearranging for `P_1`:\n$$ P_1^2 \\cdot x_{O2} \\propto \\frac{RT}{k_b} = \\text{constant at fixed T} $$\nThis shows that `P_1^2` is inversely proportional to `x_{O2}`.\nWhen we shift from a hydrogen-rich mixture to an oxygen-rich mixture, the mole fraction of oxygen, `x_{O2}`, increases. To keep the product `P_1^2 \\cdot x_{O2}` constant, the lower pressure limit `P_1` must decrease.\n\n**Analysis of the Upper Explosion Limit (Second Limit)**\n\nAt intermediate pressures, the gas is dense enough that termination occurs predominantly through three-body collisions in the gas phase. The wall termination becomes less significant. The explosion is quenched when this gas-phase termination rate becomes fast enough to compete with the branching rate.\n\nThe branching process creates more radicals than it consumes. The net rate of radical production from the `H + O2` branching pathway can be simplified to `Rate_branch = 2 k_b [H][O2]`, where the factor of 2 represents the net increase in radical count per reaction cycle.\nThe gas-phase termination reaction is `H + O2 + M -> HO2 + M`, with a rate `Rate_term_gas = k_t [H][O2][M]`.\n\nThe upper explosion limit, `P_2`, occurs when `Rate_branch = Rate_term_gas`:\n$$ 2 k_b [H][O2] = k_t [H][O2][M] $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ 2 k_b = k_t [M] $$\nThe concentration of all third bodies, `[M]`, is approximately the total concentration, `[M] \\approx P_2 / (RT)`.\nThe rate constant `k_t` is an effective rate constant that depends on the composition of the mixture, as different molecules `M` have different efficiencies as a third body. It is a weighted average of the efficiencies of H2 and O2:\n$$ k_t = x_{H2} k_{t,H2} + x_{O2} k_{t,O2} $$\nwhere `k_{t,H2}` and `k_{t,O2}` are the specific rate constants for H2 and O2 as third bodies, respectively.\n\nSubstituting these into the limit condition:\n$$ 2 k_b = (x_{H2} k_{t,H2} + x_{O2} k_{t,O2}) \\frac{P_2}{RT} $$\nSolving for the upper pressure limit `P_2`:\n$$ P_2 = \\frac{2 k_b RT}{x_{H2} k_{t,H2} + x_{O2} k_{t,O2}} $$\nThe problem states that O2 is a more effective third body than H2, which means `k_{t,O2} > k_{t,H2}`.\nNow, consider the denominator `D = x_{H2} k_{t,H2} + x_{O2} k_{t,O2}`. As we move from a H2-rich mixture (low `x_{O2}`, high `x_{H2}`) to an O2-rich mixture (high `x_{O2}`, low `x_{H2}`), we are increasing the contribution of the larger term `k_{t,O2}` and decreasing the contribution of the smaller term `k_{t,H2}`. Therefore, the value of the denominator `D` increases.\nSince `P_2` is inversely proportional to this denominator, an increase in `D` will cause `P_2` to decrease.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that:\n1. The lower pressure limit, `P_1`, decreases as the mixture becomes more oxygen-rich.\n2. The upper pressure limit, `P_2`, also decreases as the mixture becomes more oxygen-rich.\n\nTherefore, both the lower and upper pressure limits will decrease.
