In the dark, only $R_{\\mathrm{i,A}}$ contributes; if it is negligible at 300 K, the overall rate is negligible. Turning on light makes $R_{\\mathrm{i,B}}=\\phi I_{a}$ nonzero without changing $T$, causing a dramatic rate increase. This is the definitive signature of photochemical initiation dominating over thermal initiation.\n\n- B: A near doubling of rate per 10 K at around 600 K is consistent with Arrhenius temperature dependence of $k_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$, but propagation and termination steps in a photoinitiated chain also show Arrhenius-type $T$ dependence in $\\nu_{\\mathrm{chain}}(T,P)$, so this does not uniquely identify the initiation mechanism.\n\n- C: Detection of $ZH_{3}\\cdot$ confirms radicals but both mechanisms produce $ZH_{3}\\cdot$, so it does not distinguish them.\n\n- D: Increased pressure increasing rate can arise from Lindemann-type pressure effects on unimolecular initiation, but pressure also affects termination and hence $\\nu_{\\mathrm{chain}}$, so it is not conclusive.\n\n- E: Strong inhibition by a radical scavenger confirms a radical chain mechanism but does not distinguish initiation pathways, since both mechanisms create the same radicals.\n\nTherefore, only observation A directly and conclusively differentiates photochemical from thermal initiation at the same temperature by demonstrating a strong dependence on light at constant $T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1475287"}]}
