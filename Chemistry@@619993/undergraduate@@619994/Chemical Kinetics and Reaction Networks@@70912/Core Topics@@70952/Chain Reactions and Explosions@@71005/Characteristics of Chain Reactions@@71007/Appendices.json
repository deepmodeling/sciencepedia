Unlike a simple one-step reaction where the rate is maximal at the start, a chain reaction has a unique kinetic signature.

The propagation step is the primary pathway for the consumption of $A_2$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate qualitative description of the initial behavior of the rate of consumption of the reactant $A_2$ in Mechanism 2 (the chain reaction), and correctly contrasts it with the behavior in Mechanism 1 (the elementary reaction)?\n\nA. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ is initially very slow and then accelerates before eventually slowing down. This is because the concentration of the chain-carrying radicals, $R\\cdot$, must first build up from zero.\n\nB. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ is at its absolute maximum at time $t=0$ and then decreases steadily as $A_2$ is consumed, identical to the behavior in Mechanism 1.\n\nC. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ is zero for a distinct period of time (an induction period), after which the reaction abruptly begins at a constant high rate.\n\nD. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ proceeds at a constant, non-zero rate from the very beginning, because the propagation step is fast and immediately takes over.\n\nE. The rate of consumption of $A_2$ will oscillate rapidly, as the concentration of the radical $R\\cdot$ is cyclically produced in the initiation step and consumed in the termination step.", "solution": "For Mechanism 1 (elementary step), the rate of consumption of $A_{2}$ follows the elementary rate law\n$$-\\frac{d[A_{2}]}{dt} = k_{1}[A_{2}][M].$$\nAt fixed temperature and with $[M]$ effectively constant, the initial rate is\n$$\\left(-\\frac{d[A_{2}]}{dt}\\right)_{t=0} = k_{1}[A_{2}]_{0}[M],$$\nwhich is the maximum at $t=0$, and it then decreases monotonically as $[A_{2}]$ declines.\n\nFor Mechanism 2 (chain reaction), let $[R]$ denote the radical concentration.

This behavior contrasts with Mechanism 1, where the initial rate is maximal at $t=0$ and decreases monotonically thereafter.

The initiation and propagation steps are identical in both experiments:\n- **Initiation**: The initiator $I$ decomposes to form two radical species $R\\cdot$ with a rate constant $k_i$. The rate of radical formation is given by $v_{init} = 2k_i[I]$.\n- **Propagation**: A radical $R\\cdot$ reacts with a monomer $M$ to form the product and regenerate the radical. The rate of the overall reaction, $v$, is determined by this step: $v = k_p[R\\cdot][M]$, where $k_p$ is the propagation rate constant.\n\nThe experiments differ in their termination mechanisms due to different environmental conditions:\n\n- **Experiment A**: The reaction is conducted in a system where termination occurs predominantly through the reaction of radicals with a fixed component of the apparatus (e.g., the container wall).
