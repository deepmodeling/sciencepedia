In the context of autoxidation, this often translates to calculating the \"induction period\"—the duration for which an antioxidant provides protection.

Mastering this relationship is the first step toward the quantitative design of stabilized systems.", "problem": "The autoxidation of a hydrocarbon fuel, which can be modeled as a substrate $RH$, is a major cause of fuel degradation during storage. This process proceeds via a free-radical chain mechanism. The initiation step, triggered by trace impurities and heat, generates chain-carrying radicals at a constant rate $R_i$. To extend the shelf life of the fuel, a phenolic antioxidant inhibitor, $AH$, is added.\n\nFor as long as a sufficient amount of the inhibitor is present, the oxidation of the fuel itself is negligible. This duration is known as the induction period, $\\tau_{ind}$. The primary role of the inhibitor is to trap the chain-propagating peroxyl radicals ($ROO\\cdot$).

This exercise introduces the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) as a powerful mechanistic probe, allowing us to see how changing the substrate's reactivity impacts the overall process. By comparing the reaction of a normal substrate ($RH$) with its deuterated version ($RD$), you will distinguish between the factors that control the rate of uninhibited oxidation and those that govern the length of the inhibited induction period [@problem_id:1493715]. This comparison elegantly demonstrates which parts of the kinetic scheme are relevant under different conditions.", "problem": "The autoxidation of an organic substrate, RH, in the presence of a radical initiator and dissolved oxygen proceeds via a free-radical chain reaction. The simplified kinetic scheme for the uninhibited process consists of initiation, propagation, and termination steps:\n\n1.  **Initiation**: An initiator molecule decomposes to form radicals at a constant rate, $R_i$.\n2.  **Propagation**:\n    - $R\\cdot + O_2 \\rightarrow ROO\\cdot$ (fast)\n    - $ROO\\cdot + RH \\xrightarrow{k_p} ROOH + R\\cdot$ (slow, hydrogen abstraction)\n3.  **Termination**:\n    - $2 ROO\\cdot \\xrightarrow{k_t} \\text{Non-radical products}$\n\nThe overall rate of oxidation, $V$, can be defined as the rate of formation of the hydroperoxide, ROOH.\n\nTo prevent this degradation, a chain-breaking phenolic antioxidant, InH, is added. This inhibitor rapidly traps the peroxyl radicals, creating a period of very slow oxidation known as the induction period, $\\tau$.\n\nAn experiment is conducted to measure the kinetics of autoxidation of a specific substrate RH at a constant temperature and concentration. In the absence of an inhibitor, the initial rate of oxidation is measured. In the presence of a small amount of inhibitor InH, an induction period of $\\tau_H = 155$ minutes is observed.

Report your final answer as the numerical values of the dimensionless ratio $V_D / V_H$ and the induction period $\\tau_D$ in units of minutes, both rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "This problem requires us to analyze the kinetics of a free-radical chain reaction under two conditions: uninhibited autoxidation and inhibited autoxidation. We must determine how substituting the substrate RH with its deuterated analogue RD affects the reaction rate and the induction period.\n\n**Part 1: Uninhibited Autoxidation Rate Ratio ($V_D / V_H$)**\n\nFirst, we derive the rate law for the uninhibited autoxidation. The overall rate of oxidation, $V$, is given by the rate of the slow propagation step:\n$$V = k_p [ROO\\cdot] [RH]$$\nTo find the concentration of the peroxyl radical, $[ROO\\cdot]$, we apply the steady-state approximation to the radical intermediates. The concentration of the alkyl radical, $R\\cdot$, is very low because its reaction with O₂ is fast. Therefore, the dominant radical species is the peroxyl radical, $ROO\\cdot$.\n\nThe steady-state approximation for $[ROO\\cdot]$ means its rate of formation equals its rate of destruction.\nRate of formation of $ROO\\cdot$ = Rate of initiation = $R_i$. (The fast step $R\\cdot + O_2 \\rightarrow ROO\\cdot$ means every $R\\cdot$ formed by initiation is instantly converted to $ROO\\cdot$).\nRate of destruction of $ROO\\cdot$ = $2 \\times$ Rate of termination = $2k_t [ROO\\cdot]^2$. (The factor of 2 arises because two radicals are consumed in each termination event).\n\nEquating the rates:\n$$R_i = 2k_t [ROO\\cdot]^2$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration of the peroxyl radical:\n$$[ROO\\cdot]_{ss} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i}{2k_t}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression back into the rate law for oxidation:\n$$V = k_p [RH] \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i}{2k_t}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the rate of uninhibited autoxidation. Let $V_H$ be the rate for the protonated substrate RH and $V_D$ be the rate for the deuterated substrate RD.\n\nFor the protonated substrate (RH):\n$$V_H = k_{p,H} [RH] \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i}{2k_t}}$$\nFor the deuterated substrate (RD):\n$$V_D = k_{p,D} [RD] \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i}{2k_t}}$$\nThe problem states that the experiments are run under identical conditions, which means the initial concentrations $[RH] = [RD]$, the initiation rate $R_i$ (dependent on initiator concentration and temperature), and the termination rate constant $k_t$ (which involves the reaction of two $ROO\\cdot$ radicals and is independent of the substrate) are the same in both experiments.\n\nTo find the ratio $V_D / V_H$, we divide the expression for $V_D$ by that for $V_H$:\n$$\\frac{V_D}{V_H} = \\frac{k_{p,D} [RD] \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i}{2k_t}}}{k_{p,H} [RH] \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i}{2k_t}}}$$\nSince $[RH] = [RD]$ and the square root term is identical, they cancel out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{V_D}{V_H} = \\frac{k_{p,D}}{k_{p,H}}$$\nWe are given the primary Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE) as $k_{p,H} / k_{p,D} = 6.80$. Therefore, the ratio of the rates is the reciprocal of the KIE.\n$$\\frac{V_D}{V_H} = \\frac{1}{6.80} \\approx 0.147058...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $V_D / V_H = 0.147$. The deuteration significantly slows down the rate of autoxidation.\n\n**Part 2: Inhibited Induction Period ($\\tau_D$)**\n\nNext, we analyze the induction period, $\\tau$. The inhibitor, InH, is a chain-breaking antioxidant. It works by reacting with the chain-carrying peroxyl radicals ($ROO\\cdot$) much faster than the substrate does, effectively stopping the propagation cycle.\n$$ROO\\cdot + InH \\xrightarrow{k_{inh}} ROOH + In\\cdot$$\nThe resulting inhibitor radical, $In\\cdot$, is typically stable and does not propagate the chain reaction. The induction period, $\\tau$, is defined as the time it takes for the inhibitor to be completely consumed. During this period, essentially every radical generated by the initiator is trapped by an inhibitor molecule.\n\nLet $n$ be the stoichiometric factor, which is the number of peroxyl radicals trapped by one molecule of the inhibitor. The total number of radicals that can be trapped is $n[InH]_0$, where $[InH]_0$ is the initial concentration of the inhibitor.\n\nThe radicals are produced by the initiator at a constant rate $R_i$. Over the duration of the induction period $\\tau$, the total concentration of radicals generated is $R_i \\times \\tau$.\n\nAt the end of the induction period, all the inhibitor has been consumed, so we can equate the total radicals produced to the total radicals trapped:\n$$R_i \\tau = n [InH]_0$$\nSolving for the induction period, $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{n [InH]_0}{R_i}$$\nThis expression shows that the length of the induction period depends on the initial inhibitor concentration, the stoichiometric factor of the inhibitor, and the rate of initiation. Importantly, it does **not** depend on the propagation rate constant, $k_p$, or the concentration of the substrate, RH.\n\nSince the experiment with the deuterated substrate RD is conducted under identical conditions of temperature, initiator concentration, and inhibitor concentration, the values of $R_i$, $n$, and $[InH]_0$ are the same as in the experiment with RH.\nTherefore, the induction period for the deuterated substrate, $\\tau_D$, will be the same as the induction period for the protonated substrate, $\\tau_H$.\n$$\\tau_D = \\frac{n [InH]_0}{R_i} = \\tau_H$$\nGiven that $\\tau_H = 155$ minutes.\n$$\\tau_D = 155 \\text{ minutes}$$\nThis value is already given to three significant figures.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of values ($V_D / V_H, \\tau_D$).\n$V_D / V_H = 0.147$\n$\\tau_D = 155$ min", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.147 & 155 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1493715"}, {"introduction": "Real-world systems, such as lubricants, fuels, and polymers, are often complex mixtures rather than pure substances.
