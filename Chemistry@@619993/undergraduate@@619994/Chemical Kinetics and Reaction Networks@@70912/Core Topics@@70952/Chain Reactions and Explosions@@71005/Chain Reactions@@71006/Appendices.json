This dependence is governed by the specific elementary steps of initiation, propagation, and termination.\n\nConsider a hypothetical radical chain reaction for the polymerization of a monomer, $M$, into a polymer, $P$. The process is initiated by the thermal decomposition of an initiator, $I$. The radical intermediate is denoted by $R\\cdot$. The overall rate of reaction is defined as the rate of consumption of the monomer, $M$.\n\nThe reaction mechanism consists of the following steps:\n1.  **Initiation**: An initiator molecule $I$ decomposes to form two radical intermediates $R\\cdot$.\n    $$I \\xrightarrow{k_i} 2R\\cdot$$\n    The rate of initiation is given by $v_i = k_i [I]$.\n\n2.  **Propagation**: A radical intermediate reacts with a monomer molecule $M$ to form a polymer unit and regenerate the radical.\n    $$R\\cdot + M \\xrightarrow{k_p} P + R\\cdot$$\n    The rate of propagation is given by $v_p = k_p [R\\cdot][M]$.\n\nWe will analyze two different scenarios for the termination step.
