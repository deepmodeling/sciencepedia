The reaction involves the dehydrohalogenation of a secondary alkyl halide, which we denote as RX, using a hindered strong base, denoted as $B^-$. The kinetics of the E2 reaction are known to be first-order with respect to the alkyl halide and first-order with respect to the base.\n\nIn a baseline experiment (Experiment 1), the initial concentration of the alkyl halide is $[\\text{RX}]_0$ and the initial concentration of the base is $[\\text{B}^-]_0$.

The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is a powerful tool chemists use to answer this very question by measuring rate changes upon isotopic substitution, such as replacing hydrogen with deuterium.

It is known that such reactions can proceed via either a one-step (E2) or a two-step (E1) pathway. To help distinguish between these possibilities, the chemist synthesizes two versions of the substrate: one with hydrogens at the $\\beta$-carbons and another where all hydrogens at the $\\beta$-carbons have been replaced with deuterium. The reaction rates for the hydrogen-containing substrate ($k_H$) and the deuterium-containing substrate ($k_D$) are then measured under identical conditions. The ratio of these rates, $k_H/k_D$, is known as the primary Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE).\n\nSelect all statements that correctly describe the expected experimental observation and its mechanistic implication.\n\nA.

Therefore, a large primary KIE ($k_{H}/k_{D}\\gg 1$) is expected, supporting E2. This matches statement A.\n\nFor an E1 mechanism, the rate-determining step is unimolecular ionization to form the carbocation (C–X bond cleavage).

This matches statement D.\n\nStatement B is incorrect because a large primary KIE argues against E1. Statement C is incorrect because absence of a primary KIE argues against E2. Statement E is incorrect because C–D is not weaker than C–H; it is effectively stronger (lower zero-point energy), and the observed primary KIE is typically $k_{H}/k_{D}>1$ when that bond is involved in the transition state.
