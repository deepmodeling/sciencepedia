When the solvent is changed from normal water (H₂O) to heavy water (D₂O), the acidic species becomes D₃O⁺. This change results in a primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), defined as the ratio of the rate constant in H₂O ($k_H$) to the rate constant in D₂O ($k_D$), i.e., $KIE = k_H/k_D$.\n\nAt room temperature, this reaction exhibits a normal KIE, where $k_H/k_D > 1$. This effect is primarily attributed to the difference in zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE) between the O-H bond in H₃O⁺ and the O-D bond in D₃O⁺. The O-H bond has a higher vibrational frequency and thus a higher ZPE than the O-D bond.\n\nAssuming this ZPE difference is the dominant factor, which of the following statements best describes and explains the expected trend for the magnitude of the KIE ($k_H/k_D$) as the temperature of the reaction is significantly increased?\n\nA.
