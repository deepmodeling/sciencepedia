Two competing fragmentation pathways, A and B, are observed, leading to distinct product ions $P_A$ and $P_B$, respectively.\n\nPathway A is a direct cleavage of the peptide amide bond. Pathway B involves a rate-determining step where an intramolecular proton transfer occurs from the N-terminal ammonium group ($-\\text{NH}_3^+$) to another part of the molecule, which precedes the bond cleavage.\n\nIn a first experiment, the CID of the normal 'light' isotopologue of the ion, where the N-terminal group is $-\\text{NH}_3^+$, is studied. The ratio of the measured ion intensities, defined as the branching ratio $R_L = I(P_A) / I(P_B)$, is found to be 1.50.\n\nIn a second experiment, a 'heavy' isotopologue is studied.
