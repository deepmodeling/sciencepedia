The rate of this reaction is highly dependent on the structural and electronic changes that occur upon electron transfer.\n\nConsider the two self-exchange reactions involving the octahedral ammine complexes of cobalt and ruthenium:\n1. $[Co(NH_3)_6]^{2+/3+}$\n2. $[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{2+/3+}$\n\nExperimentally, the self-exchange rate for the ruthenium system is many orders of magnitude faster (rate constant $k \\approx 10^{3}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$) than for the cobalt system (rate constant $k \\approx 10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$). Assume that both systems undergo outer-sphere electron transfer and that the contributions from solvent reorganization are comparable for both reactions.\n\nGiven the following information for the octahedral complexes:\n- For first-row transition metals like Cobalt, ammine ($NH_3$) ligands can result in either high-spin or low-spin complexes depending on the oxidation state.

The cobalt reaction is slow because the electron transfer involves a change in the occupancy of $\\sigma$-antibonding ($e_g$) orbitals, leading to a large structural reorganization. The ruthenium reaction is fast because the electron is transferred between non-bonding ($t_{2g}$) orbitals, resulting in minimal structural change.\n\nB. The cobalt reaction is slow because Co is a first-row transition metal, which inherently forms weaker bonds and has slower kinetics than second-row metals like Ru.\n\nC. The ruthenium reaction is fast because both Ru(II) and Ru(III) complexes are low-spin, creating a low-energy pathway. The cobalt reaction is slow because it involves a conversion from a high-spin Co(II) to a low-spin Co(III) complex.\n\nD. The difference in rate is due to the different ligand field strengths. Ammine ($NH_3$) acts as a weak-field ligand for Co(II) but a strong-field ligand for Ru(II), causing the disparity in electronic structure.\n\nE.

The problem states that solvent reorganization is comparable for both systems, so the observed rate difference must arise primarily from differences in $\\lambda_{i}$ and, secondarily, from any systematic differences in $|H_{AB}|$.\n\nThe inner-sphere reorganization energy $\\lambda_{i}$ increases with the magnitude of structural changes (notably metal–ligand bond length changes) along the electron transfer coordinate. In an octahedral field, the $e_{g}$ set is $\\sigma$-antibonding with respect to metal–ligand bonds, whereas the $t_{2g}$ set is nonbonding with respect to the $\\sigma$ framework. Therefore, changes in $e_{g}$ occupancy cause large bond length changes and hence a large $\\lambda_{i}$, while changes confined to $t_{2g}$ occupancy cause much smaller structural changes and thus a smaller $\\lambda_{i}$.\n\nNow consider electron configurations:\n- For cobalt ammines:\n  - $\\text{[Co(NH}_{3})_{6}]^{2+}$ is high-spin $d^{7}$ in an octahedral field: $t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{2}$.\n  - $\\text{[Co(NH}_{3})_{6}]^{3+}$ is low-spin $d^{6}$: $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$.\n  The self-exchange thus interconverts a species with two $e_{g}$ electrons and one with zero $e_{g}$ electrons. Because $e_{g}$ orbitals are $\\sigma$-antibonding, this implies a large change in metal–ligand bond lengths between the two oxidation states, yielding a large $\\lambda_{i}$ and, by the exponential dependence on $\\lambda$, a very small $k$.\n\n- For ruthenium ammines (second-row, large splitting, typically low-spin):\n  - $\\text{[Ru(NH}_{3})_{6}]^{2+}$ is low-spin $d^{6}$: $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$.\n  - $\\text{[Ru(NH}_{3})_{6}]^{3+}$ is low-spin $d^{5}$: $t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{0}$.\n  The self-exchange changes only the $t_{2g}$ occupancy while keeping $e_{g}$ occupancy at zero on both sides. Because $t_{2g}$ is nonbonding with respect to the $\\sigma$ framework, metal–ligand bond lengths change minimally, giving a small $\\lambda_{i}$ and hence a much larger $k$.\n\nGiven the comparable $\\lambda_{s}$ and that the dominant difference is whether the electron transfer changes $e_{g}$ occupancy ($\\sigma$-antibonding) or remains within $t_{2g}$ (nonbonding), the decisive factor is the inner-sphere reorganization energy driven by $e_{g}$ versus $t_{2g}$ occupancy changes.
