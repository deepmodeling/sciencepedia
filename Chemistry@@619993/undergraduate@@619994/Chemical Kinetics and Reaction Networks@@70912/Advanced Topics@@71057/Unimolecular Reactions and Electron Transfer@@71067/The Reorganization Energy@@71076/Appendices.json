In this case, the term $(\\lambda + \\Delta G^\\circ)$ is positive. If we increase the driving force (make $\\Delta G^\\circ$ more negative), the value of $(\\lambda + \\Delta G^\\circ)$ decreases, which in turn decreases the value of $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$. A smaller $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ leads to a faster reaction rate. So, in the normal region, increasing the driving force increases the reaction rate. This matches the intuitive expectation that more favorable reactions should be faster.\n\n2.  **Inverted Region**: For driving forces greater than the reorganization energy, i.e., $-\\Delta G^\\circ > \\lambda$, which is equivalent to $\\Delta G^\\circ  -\\lambda$. In this case, the term $(\\lambda + \\Delta G^\\circ)$ is negative. If we increase the driving force further (make $\\Delta G^\\circ$ even more negative), the absolute value of $(\\lambda + \\Delta G^\\circ)$ increases.
