One common circuit is a genetic oscillator, which can act as a cellular clock. Consider a simple synthetic oscillator based on a negative feedback loop: a gene produces a messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into a repressor protein P. The protein P, in turn, inhibits the production of its own mRNA, thus closing the loop.\n\nFor such a system, under a set of simplifying assumptions, the period of oscillation, $T$, is well-approximated by the formula:\n$$ T = C \\sqrt{\\tau_M \\tau_P} $$\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant, $\\tau_M$ is the characteristic lifetime of the mRNA molecule, and $\\tau_P$ is the characteristic lifetime of the repressor protein.
