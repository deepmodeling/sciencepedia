The patch maintains a constant concentration of the agent, $C_0$, at the skin's surface, which is defined as the plane $x=0$. The agent diffuses into the tissue, which can be modeled as a semi-infinite medium for $x \\geq 0$. As the agent diffuses, it is simultaneously eliminated by metabolic processes within the tissue. This elimination is observed to follow zero-order kinetics, meaning the agent is removed at a constant rate $k$ (amount per unit volume per unit time), as long as its local concentration is greater than zero. The agent's movement is characterized by a constant diffusion coefficient, $D$.\n\nAfter the system has been operating for a long time, a steady state is established.
