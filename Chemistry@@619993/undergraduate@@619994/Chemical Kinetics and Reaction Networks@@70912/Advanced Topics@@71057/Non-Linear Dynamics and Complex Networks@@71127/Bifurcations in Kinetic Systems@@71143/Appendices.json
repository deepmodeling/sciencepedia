According to the problem statement, this type of bifurcation happens when one of the real eigenvalues of the system's Jacobian matrix is equal to zero.\n\nThe given expression for the eigenvalues is:\n$$ \\lambda = p - \\alpha \\pm \\sqrt{p - \\beta} $$\nWe are given the constants $\\alpha = 3$ and $\\beta = 1$. Substituting these values, we get:\n$$ \\lambda = p - 3 \\pm \\sqrt{p - 1} $$\nFor the eigenvalues to be real, the argument of the square root must be non-negative. This imposes a constraint on the possible values of $p$:\n$$ p - 1 \\ge 0 \\implies p \\ge 1 $$\nIf $p < 1$, the eigenvalues would be complex, which corresponds to a different type of stability analysis (e.g., related to Hopf bifurcations), not a saddle-node bifurcation as defined in the problem.\n\nThe condition for a saddle-node bifurcation is that one eigenvalue is zero. So, we set $\\lambda = 0$:\n$$ 0 = p - 3 \\pm \\sqrt{p - 1} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ 3 - p = \\pm \\sqrt{p - 1} $$\nThis gives us two separate cases to solve.\n\nCase 1: $3 - p = + \\sqrt{p - 1}$\nFor this equation to have a real solution, the left side must be non-negative, since the square root on the right side is defined to be non-negative.\n$$ 3 - p \\ge 0 \\implies p \\le 3 $$\nCombining this with our initial constraint $p \\ge 1$, any solution from this case must lie in the interval $1 \\le p \\le 3$.\nNow, we can square both sides of the equation:\n$$ (3 - p)^2 = (\\sqrt{p - 1})^2 $$\n$$ 9 - 6p + p^2 = p - 1 $$\nRearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation $ap^2+bp+c=0$:\n$$ p^2 - 7p + 10 = 0 $$\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factoring:\n$$ (p - 2)(p - 5) = 0 $$\nThe potential solutions are $p = 2$ and $p = 5$. We must check these against the constraint for this case, which is $1 \\le p \\le 3$. The value $p = 2$ satisfies this constraint, but $p = 5$ does not. Thus, $p=2$ is a valid bifurcation point from this case.\n\nCase 2: $3 - p = - \\sqrt{p - 1}$\nFor this equation to have a real solution, the left side must be non-positive.\n$$ 3 - p \\le 0 \\implies p \\ge 3 $$\nCombining this with our initial constraint $p \\ge 1$, any solution from this case must satisfy $p \\ge 3$.\nNow, we square both sides of the equation. Note that squaring $-(...)$ gives the same result as squaring $+(...)$:\n$$ (3 - p)^2 = (-\\sqrt{p - 1})^2 $$\n$$ p^2 - 6p + 9 = p - 1 $$\nThis again leads to the same quadratic equation:\n$$ p^2 - 7p + 10 = 0 $$\nThe roots are again $p = 2$ and $p = 5$. We check these against the constraint for this case, which is $p \\ge 3$. The value $p = 5$ satisfies this constraint, but $p = 2$ does not. Thus, $p=5$ is a valid bifurcation point from this case.\n\nIn summary, we have found two values of the parameter $p$ where a saddle-node bifurcation occurs: $p = 2$ and $p = 5$.\nThe problem asks for the largest value of $p$.
