This exercise challenges you to distinguish between 'space time' ($\\tau$), a convenient design parameter based on inlet conditions, and 'mean residence time' ($\\bar{t}$), the actual average time a molecule spends in the system. By analyzing a heated Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) with a gas that expands as it flows, you will discover how and why these two quantities can differ, providing a deeper insight into the dynamics of fluid flow in reactors.", "problem": "An inert, ideal gas flows steadily through a long, heated tube of total internal volume $V$. The flow pattern can be modeled as that of a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR). The gas enters the tube at a volumetric flow rate of $v_0$ and a density of $\\rho_0$. Due to heating, the gas expands as it travels through the tube, and the pressure is maintained constant throughout.

The space time is given by the definition:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{V}{v_0} $$\nwhere $V$ is the total reactor volume and $v_0$ is the inlet volumetric flow rate.\n\nThe mean residence time, $\\bar{t}$, is the time it takes for an average fluid particle to pass through the reactor. For a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR), we can calculate this by integrating the time required to traverse each infinitesimal volume element $dV'$ along the reactor length. The time $dt$ to traverse a volume element $dV'$ is given by:\n$$ dt = \\frac{dV'}{v(V')} $$\nwhere $v(V')$ is the local volumetric flow rate at the position corresponding to cumulative volume $V'$. The mean residence time is the integral of $dt$ over the entire reactor volume:\n$$ \\bar{t} = \\int_0^V \\frac{dV'}{v(V')} $$\nThe mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}$, must be constant throughout the tube due to the principle of mass conservation for a steady-state flow.
