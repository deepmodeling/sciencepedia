The reaction involves an initiator that generates free radicals and a monomer that propagates the polymer chain. Through careful measurements, the team determines that, under their experimental conditions, the initial rate of chain propagation ($R_p$) is 1000 times greater than the initial rate of chain initiation ($R_i$). Further analysis reveals that the termination of growing polymer chains occurs predominantly through the combination of two radicals.

Mastering this derivation allows chemists and engineers to rationally adjust reaction conditions to tailor a polymer's molecular weight for a specific application.", "problem": "A polymer chemist is studying the kinetics of a free-radical polymerization process in which a monomer, $M$, is converted into a polymer. The reaction is initiated by the thermal decomposition of an initiator, $I$. The elementary steps of the process are as follows:\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The initiator $I$ decomposes with a rate constant $k_d$ to form two primary radicals. Each primary radical then reacts with a monomer molecule to start a polymer chain. The efficiency of this initiation process is given by a factor $f$, which represents the fraction of primary radicals that successfully initiate a chain. The overall rate of initiation, $R_i$, is given by $R_i = 2fk_d[I]$.\n\n2.  **Propagation:** A growing polymer chain with an active radical end, denoted $M^\\bullet$, reacts with a monomer $M$ to extend the chain. This step has a rate constant $k_p$. The rate of propagation is given by $R_p = k_p[M][M^\\bullet]$, where $[M^\\bullet]$ is the total concentration of all radical-terminated polymer chains.\n\n3.  **Termination:** Two growing polymer chains react and terminate, ending their growth. This bimolecular termination step has a rate constant $k_t$. The rate of termination, which is the rate at which radicals are consumed, is given by $R_t = 2k_t[M^\\bullet]^2$.\n\nThe kinetic chain length, $\\nu$, is defined as the ratio of the rate of propagation to the rate of initiation. This quantity is directly proportional to the average molecular weight of the polymer formed.\n\nFor a particular synthesis, the chemist wants to maintain a constant kinetic chain length to ensure product consistency. In a standard batch, the initial monomer concentration is $[M]_1$ and the initial initiator concentration is $[I]_1$. In a subsequent experimental batch, the initial monomer concentration is increased to $[M]_2 = 1.35 [M]_1$. To compensate for this change and keep the kinetic chain length the same as in the standard batch, the initial initiator concentration is adjusted to a new value, $[I]_2$.\n\nAssuming the concentration of radical intermediates, $[M^\\bullet]$, reaches a steady state, determine the factor by which the initial initiator concentration must be changed.
