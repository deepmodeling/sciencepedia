The interactions between the adsorbate molecules are significantly weaker than the interaction of the adsorbate molecules with the surface. This leads to a convex isotherm shape (Type III).\n\nB. The interaction of the adsorbate molecules with the surface is exceptionally strong, meaning a complete monolayer forms before any multilayer adsorption begins.

A standard result of the BET derivation is that $c$ can be written as an Arrhenius-type factor involving the difference between the molar enthalpy of adsorption for the first layer and the molar enthalpy of liquefaction (or condensation) for the adsorbate.

Physically, this means the adsorbate-surface interaction is weaker than the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction (the adsorbate molecules prefer interacting with each other rather than with the surface).\n\nAccording to IUPAC, when adsorbate-adsorbent interactions are weaker than adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, the adsorption isotherm shows an initially convex curvature with no distinct monolayer “knee,” characteristic of a Type III isotherm (on nonporous or macroporous solids). Therefore, the correct interpretation of $c<1$ is weaker adsorbate-surface interaction than adsorbate-adsorbate interaction, leading to a Type III (convex) isotherm.\n\nComparing with the options:\n- Options A and B contradict the implication of $c<1$ (they imply stronger surface interaction).\n- Option D assigns a Type II shape, which is associated with $c>1$ and a clear monolayer knee, so it is inconsistent with $c<1$.\n- Option E describes Type V but incorrectly attributes it to “comparable” interactions and “microporous” capillary condensation; Type V arises from weak adsorbent-adsorbate interactions in mesoporous materials and exhibits capillary condensation, but the key signature of $c<1$ in the absence of specific pore effects is the Type III shape.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that the surface interaction is weaker than adsorbate-adsorbate interaction, giving a Type III isotherm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1516361"}]}
