The governing equation for the concentration $C(x)$ of species A is Fick's second law at steady state:\n$$D \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} = 0$$\nThe general solution to this ordinary differential equation is a linear concentration profile:\n$$C(x) = mx + c$$\nwhere $m$ and $c$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary condition at the edge of the diffusion layer is the same for both cases: the concentration equals the bulk concentration.\n$$C(\\delta) = C_{bulk}$$\n\nLet's analyze each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: Ideal Mass-Transport-Limited Flux ($j_{mt}$)**\nIn this case, the reaction at the electrode surface ($x=0$) is assumed to be infinitely fast. This means any molecule of A that reaches the surface is instantly consumed.

The flux of species A being consumed by the reaction is $k_{het} C(0)$. At steady state, this consumption must be balanced by the diffusive flux arriving at the electrode surface. The diffusive flux arriving at the surface (rate of supply) is given by $-J(0) = -(-D \\frac{dC}{dx}|_{x=0}) = D \\frac{dC}{dx}|_{x=0}$.\nSo, the boundary condition at $x=0$ is a balance of supply and demand:\n$$D \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = k_{het} C(0)$$\nApplying this to the general solution $C(x) = mx+c$:\n$\\frac{dC}{dx} = m$ and $C(0) = c$.
