The enzyme is modeled as a symmetric dimer, meaning its two ligand binding sites are identical and indistinguishable. The binding process is believed to follow the principles of an induced-fit mechanism, similar to the Koshland-Némethy-Filmer (KNF) model.\n\nThe following constants are defined to describe the system:\n- The **microscopic association constant**, $K_S$, represents the intrinsic binding affinity of a ligand to a single, isolated binding site on one of the subunits.\n- The **interaction constant**, $K_{\\text{int}}$, is a dimensionless factor that quantifies the allosteric effect.
