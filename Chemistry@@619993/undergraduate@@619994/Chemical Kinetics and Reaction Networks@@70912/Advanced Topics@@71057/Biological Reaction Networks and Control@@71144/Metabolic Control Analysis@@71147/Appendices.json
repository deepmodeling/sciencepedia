The enzyme is known to follow simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, where its reaction rate, $v$, is described by the equation:\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}} S}{K_M + S}\n$$\nIn this model, $S$ represents the concentration of the substrate, $V_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum possible reaction rate, and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant. To understand how fluctuations in substrate levels affect the enzyme's activity, the bioengineer uses Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA). A key parameter in MCA is the elasticity coefficient, $\\epsilon_S^v$, which provides a dimensionless measure of an enzyme's local sensitivity to changes in the concentration of a metabolite. For the substrate $S$, this coefficient quantifies the fractional change in the enzyme's rate $v$ resulting from an infinitesimal fractional change in the substrate concentration $S$.\n\nDerive an analytical expression for the elasticity coefficient $\\epsilon_S^v$ as a function of the substrate concentration $S$ and the Michaelis constant $K_M$.", "solution": "The elasticity coefficient, $\\epsilon_S^v$, is defined as the partial derivative of the natural logarithm of the reaction rate $v$ with respect to the natural logarithm of the substrate concentration $S$. An equivalent and more direct definition for calculation is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_S^v = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial S} \\frac{S}{v}\n$$\nThe problem provides the Michaelis-Menten equation for the reaction rate $v$ as a function of the substrate concentration $S$:\n$$\nv(S) = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}} S}{K_M + S}\n$$\nFirst, we must calculate the partial derivative of the rate $v$ with respect to the substrate concentration $S$, which is $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial S}$.

The term $V_{\\text{max}}$ cancels out. The term $S$ also cancels out.
