A simplified model for drug elimination assumes that the drug is removed from the body via a first-order process. For such a process, the rate of change of the drug's concentration, $C$, is directly proportional to its current concentration. This can be described by the differential equation $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC$, where $k$ is the elimination rate constant.\n\nTo simulate this process computationally without solving the differential equation analytically, one can use numerical methods. The Forward Euler method is a basic technique for this purpose. It approximates the state of a system at a future time step based on its current state. Let $C_n$ be the concentration of the drug at time $t_n$.
