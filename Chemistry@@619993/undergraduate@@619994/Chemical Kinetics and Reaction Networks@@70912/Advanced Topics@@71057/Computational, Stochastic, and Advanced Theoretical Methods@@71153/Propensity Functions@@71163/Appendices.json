This exercise [@problem_id:1505771] asks you to formulate the propensity for a bimolecular reaction involving two different molecular species. Understanding this case is fundamental, as the number of possible reaction pairs is simply the product of the counts of each reactant, and it provides a clear link between macroscopic rate constants and the stochastic framework.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a cellular signaling network, a substrate protein $S$ is activated through phosphorylation by a kinase enzyme $K$. This activation process is a bimolecular reaction where the kinase acts as a catalyst and is not consumed. The reaction can be represented as:\n$$S + K \\rightarrow S_p + K$$\nwhere $S_p$ is the phosphorylated, active form of the substrate. This phosphorylation reaction is characterized by a second-order rate constant $k_{phos}$.\n\nThe reaction occurs within a cellular compartment that can be considered well-mixed and has a constant volume $V$. At a particular instant, the compartment contains $N_S$ molecules of the substrate $S$ and $N_K$ molecules of the kinase $K$. Concurrently, the substrate $S$ is also subject to degradation through a separate enzymatic process, but our focus is solely on the phosphorylation event.\n\nAssuming the principles of stochastic chemical kinetics, derive an expression for the propensity function, $a_{phos}$, for this specific phosphorylation reaction. Your final expression should be in terms of the parameters $k_{phos}$, $N_S$, $N_K$, and $V$.", "solution": "We model the elementary phosphorylation event as the bimolecular reaction $S + K \\rightarrow S_{p} + K$, where one $S$ molecule and one $K$ molecule must encounter. In stochastic chemical kinetics, the propensity $a_{phos}$ is the probability per unit time that this reaction fires in the next infinitesimal interval, given the current molecule counts. For an elementary reaction between two distinct reactants, mass-action kinetics gives the deterministic reaction rate (number of reaction events per unit time) as\n$$\nr = k_{phos} [S][K] V,\n$$\nwhere $[S] = N_{S}/V$ and $[K] = N_{K}/V$ are the concentrations and $V$ is the compartment volume.
