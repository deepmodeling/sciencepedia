Consider a simple bimolecular reaction between an atom `A` and a diatomic molecule `BC`, represented as:\n\n$\\text{A} + \\text{BC} \\rightarrow \\text{AB} + \\text{C}$\n\nWe analyze this reaction in the center-of-mass reference frame. The impact parameter, denoted by `b`, is defined as the perpendicular distance between the initial velocity vector of reactant `A` and the center of mass of reactant `BC`. The scattering angle, denoted by `\\theta`, is the angle between the initial velocity vector of `A` and the final velocity vector of the product molecule `AB`.\n\nSuppose this reaction proceeds via a direct \"rebound\" mechanism, which is strongly favored for head-on collisions where the impact parameter `b` is approximately zero. In this scenario, atom `A` collides directly with atom `B` along the axis of the `BC` molecule, leading to the immediate formation of `AB` and ejection of `C`.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expected angular distribution of the `AB` product molecules for reactions occurring under this specific head-on collision condition (`b=0`)?\n\nA.

For $b=0$ we have\n$$\nL=0.\n$$\nThus the motion is strictly collinear along the line of centers; there is no sideways deflection because there is no angular momentum available to generate azimuthal scattering.\n\n2) Conservation of linear momentum. In the CM frame the total momentum is zero both before and after reaction. Denote the product velocities along $z$ by $u$ for AB and $w$ for C, with masses $m_{AB}$ and $m_{C}$, respectively.

Because $L=0$ forbids sideways scattering, the angular distribution for AB under this head-on rebound condition is narrowly peaked near $\\theta\\approx\\pi$ (backward). This matches the qualitative description of a predominantly backward-scattered product for the direct rebound mechanism, distinguishing it from forward-scattered “stripping” or isotropic/sideways distributions.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that scattering is predominantly backward.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1529483"}]}
