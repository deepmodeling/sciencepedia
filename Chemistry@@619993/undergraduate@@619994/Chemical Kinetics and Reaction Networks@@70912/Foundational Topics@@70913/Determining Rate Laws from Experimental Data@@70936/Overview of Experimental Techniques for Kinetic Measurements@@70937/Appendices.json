The reaction is known to be elementary, and thus its rate law is given by $\\text{rate} = k[A][B]$, where $k$ is the second-order rate constant. To simplify the data analysis, the engineer wishes to set up an experiment where the reaction kinetics can be accurately approximated by a simpler rate law, $\\text{rate} \\approx k'[A]$, where $k'$ is a new, constant value. Which of the following initial concentration setups would be the most suitable for achieving this goal?\n\nA. Initial concentration of $A$ is $1.00 \\, \\text{mol/L}$, and initial concentration of $B$ is $0.01 \\, \\text{mol/L}$.\n\nB.

Initial concentration of $A$ is $0.10 \\, \\text{mol/L}$, and initial concentration of $B$ is $0.12 \\, \\text{mol/L}$.\n\nE. It is impossible to achieve this goal, as the true rate law inherently depends on the concentrations of both $A$ and $B$.", "solution": "The objective is to find experimental conditions under which the rate law, $\\text{rate} = k[A][B]$, can be approximated as $\\text{rate} \\approx k'[A]$. For this approximation to be valid, the concentration of reactant B, $[B]$, must remain effectively constant throughout the course of the reaction.\n\nLet's denote the initial concentrations of the reactants as $[A]_0$ and $[B]_0$. As the reaction $A + B \\rightarrow P$ proceeds, both $[A]$ and $[B]$ will decrease. For the concentration of B to be considered constant, its change over the course of the reaction must be negligible compared to its initial concentration.\n\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1. This means that for every mole of A that reacts, one mole of B also reacts. The reaction will stop (or slow down significantly) when the limiting reactant is mostly consumed. To make the rate law appear dependent only on $[A]$, we must ensure that A is the limiting reactant and that it is present in a much smaller quantity than B.\n\nIf we set up the experiment such that $[B]_0 \\gg [A]_0$, then A will be the limiting reactant. The maximum possible change in the concentration of B occurs when all of A has reacted. In this scenario, the concentration of B will decrease by an amount equal to $[A]_0$.\nThe concentration of B at any time $t$ will be $[B] = [B]_0 - (\\text{amount of B reacted})$. The maximum change is $\\Delta[B]_{\\text{max}} = [A]_0$.\n\nFor $[B]$ to be approximately constant, we need this maximum change to be a very small fraction of the initial concentration of B. Mathematically, this condition is $\\Delta[B]_{\\text{max}} \\ll [B]_0$, which translates to $[A]_0 \\ll [B]_0$.\nIf this condition is met, we can approximate the concentration of B at any time as $[B] \\approx [B]_0$.\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the original rate law gives:\n$\\text{rate} = k[A][B] \\approx k[A][B]_0$\n\nWe can then define a new constant, the pseudo-first-order rate constant $k'$, as $k' = k[B]_0$. The rate law simplifies to:\n$\\text{rate} \\approx k'[A]$\n\nThis technique is often called the \"method of flooding\" or the \"method of isolation\".\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on the condition $[A]_0 \\ll [B]_0$, which is equivalent to the ratio $[B]_0 / [A]_0 \\gg 1$.\n\nA. $[A]_0 = 1.00 \\, \\text{mol/L}$, $[B]_0 = 0.01 \\, \\text{mol/L}$.\nThe ratio is $[B]_0 / [A]_0 = 0.01 / 1.00 = 0.01$. This ratio is much less than 1. In this case, B is the limiting reactant, and the kinetics would be pseudo-first-order with respect to B, not A. So, this is incorrect.\n\nB. $[A]_0 = 0.10 \\, \\text{mol/L}$, $[B]_0 = 0.10 \\, \\text{mol/L}$.\nThe ratio is $[B]_0 / [A]_0 = 0.10 / 0.10 = 1$. The initial concentrations are equal. The concentrations of both reactants will change significantly during the reaction, and no simplification is possible. This is a standard second-order condition. So, this is incorrect.\n\nC. $[A]_0 = 0.01 \\, \\text{mol/L}$, $[B]_0 = 2.00 \\, \\text{mol/L}$.\nThe ratio is $[B]_0 / [A]_0 = 2.00 / 0.01 = 200$. This ratio is much greater than 1 ($200 \\gg 1$), satisfying the condition $[A]_0 \\ll [B]_0$. The concentration of B will change from $2.00 \\, \\text{mol/L}$ to a minimum of $2.00 - 0.01 = 1.99 \\, \\text{mol/L}$, which is a change of only 0.5%. Thus, B can be considered constant, and the pseudo-first-order approximation is excellent. This is the correct choice.\n\nD. $[A]_0 = 0.10 \\, \\text{mol/L}$, $[B]_0 = 0.12 \\, \\text{mol/L}$.\nThe ratio is $[B]_0 / [A]_0 = 0.12 / 0.10 = 1.2$. This ratio is not much greater than 1. The concentration of B will change from $0.12 \\, \\text{mol/L}$ to a minimum of $0.12 - 0.10 = 0.02 \\, \\text{mol/L}$. This is a substantial change (over 80% decrease), so the concentration of B cannot be considered constant. The approximation would be poor. So, this is incorrect.\n\nE. This option claims the goal is impossible. However, the method of flooding, as described above, is a standard and valid experimental technique for simplifying rate laws. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the experimental setup described in option C is the most suitable for making the reaction appear first-order with respect to A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1502096"}, {"introduction": "Beyond determining the rate law, kinetic experiments can provide profound insights into the reaction mechanismâ€”the sequence of elementary steps at the molecular level.
