This practice challenges you to think strategically, comparing two powerful spectroscopic methods—Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy—for monitoring an organic reaction. Your task is to justify the most practical choice by considering which technique provides the clearest and most unambiguous signal for the disappearance of the starting material [@problem_id:1477211].", "problem": "A student in an organic chemistry lab is tasked with monitoring the progress of a chemical reaction in which 3-hexanone is reduced to 3-hexanol using sodium borohydride ($\\text{NaBH}_4$) in an ethanol solvent. The goal is to determine the most straightforward spectroscopic method for observing the consumption of the starting material, 3-hexanone. The two available instruments are an Infrared (IR) spectrometer and a proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR) spectrometer.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and practical justification for choosing one technique over the other to easily monitor the disappearance of the 3-hexanone?\n\nA. $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR spectroscopy should be chosen because the disappearance of the unique signal for the protons on the terminal methyl groups of 3-hexanone provides a clear and easily integrable signal.\n\nB. IR spectroscopy should be chosen because the appearance of the broad $\\text{O-H}$ bond stretching signal from the 3-hexanol product is more intense and appears in a more isolated region of the spectrum than any signal change in the $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR.\n\nC. IR spectroscopy should be chosen because the disappearance of the sharp and intense $\\text{C=O}$ bond stretching absorption of the 3-hexanone ketone is an easily identifiable event in a relatively uncrowded region of the spectrum.\n\nD. $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR spectroscopy should be chosen because the number of unique proton signals decreases as the reaction proceeds, simplifying the spectrum and making the endpoint obvious.\n\nE. IR spectroscopy should be chosen because the ethanol solvent will not produce any signals, whereas in $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR, the solvent signals would completely obscure all signals from the reactant and product.", "solution": "The reaction reduces a ketone (3-hexanone) to a secondary alcohol (3-hexanol) using $\\text{NaBH}_{4}$ in ethanol. Monitoring the disappearance of the starting ketone is best done by tracking a functional group feature that is (i) unique to the starting material, (ii) intense, and (iii) appears in a relatively uncrowded spectral region given the ethanol solvent.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy has a strong, sharp $\\text{C=O}$ stretching absorption for saturated, acyclic ketones near $1715\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. The IR absorption intensity is governed by the transition dipole moment; the $\\text{C=O}$ stretch produces a large change in dipole moment, so this band is strong and easily detected. Upon reduction to the alcohol, the $\\text{C=O}$ group is removed, so the disappearance of this sharp and intense band is a clear and direct indicator of consumption of 3-hexanone. The ethanol solvent exhibits a broad $\\text{O-H}$ stretch around $3200\\text{–}3600\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and various $\\text{C-H}$ and $\\text{C-O}$ bands, but it does not produce a strong, sharp band in the $1700\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ region, leaving the $\\text{C=O}$ region relatively uncrowded for monitoring.\n\nBy contrast, the appearance of an $\\text{O-H}$ stretch for the product is not a reliable handle in ethanol solvent because the solvent’s own broad $\\text{O-H}$ band dominates that region; therefore, using the product $\\text{O-H}$ in IR (as in option B) is not practical here.\n\nIn $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR, the terminal methyl groups in both 3-hexanone and 3-hexanol produce similar signals, so there is no unique methyl signal that cleanly disappears (contradicting option A). Moreover, the number of unique proton environments does not necessarily decrease on going from ketone to alcohol, and coupling/chemical shift changes do not guarantee a simpler spectrum (contradicting option D). Finally, it is false that ethanol produces no IR signals or that NMR solvent signals would obscure all analyte signals; NMR samples can be prepared in deuterated solvents after quenching, and IR spectra of ethanol certainly show many bands (contradicting option E).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and practical justification is to use IR spectroscopy to monitor the disappearance of the sharp, intense $\\text{C=O}$ stretching band of the ketone in a relatively uncrowded region of the spectrum, which matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1477211"}, {"introduction": "Fluorescence spectroscopy is a highly sensitive method widely used in biochemistry to study reaction kinetics, especially when dealing with low concentrations.
