The relationship between the rate constant ($k$), temperature ($T$), and activation energy ($E_a$) is described by the Arrhenius equation:\n$$k = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor and $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n\nTo find $E_a$, we can use the two-point form of the Arrhenius equation, which compares the rate constants at two different temperatures, $T_1$ and $T_2$:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_2}{k_1}\\right) = -\\frac{E_a}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_1$ is the rate constant at temperature $T_1$, and $k_2$ is the rate constant at temperature $T_2$.\n\nFirst, we must convert the given temperatures from degrees Celsius to Kelvin:\n$T_1 = 21.0^\\circ\\text{C} + 273.15 = 294.15 \\, \\text{K}$\n$T_2 = 28.0^\\circ\\text{C} + 273.15 = 301.15 \\, \\text{K}$\n\nNext, we need to determine the ratio of the rate constants, $\\frac{k_2}{k_1}$.
