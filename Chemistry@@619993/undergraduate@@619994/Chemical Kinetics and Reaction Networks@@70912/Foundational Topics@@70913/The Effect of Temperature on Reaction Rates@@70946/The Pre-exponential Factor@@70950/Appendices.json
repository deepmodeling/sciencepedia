To determine this, we must analyze the units of the terms in the rate law and the Arrhenius equation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the general form of a rate law for a reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = k [\\text{Reactant}]^n\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant, $[\\text{Reactant}]$ is the concentration of the reactant, and $n$ is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The overall rate of a reaction always has units of concentration per unit time. Based on the problem statement, the units of concentration are moles per liter (M) and the units of time are seconds (s). Therefore, the units of the rate are $\\text{M s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem states that the reaction is zero-order. This means the overall reaction order is $n=0$. The rate law for this specific reaction is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = k [\\text{Reactant}]^0\n$$\nSince any quantity raised to the power of zero is 1, the rate law simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = k\n$$\nThis means that for a zero-order reaction, the rate constant $k$ is equal to the rate of the reaction.
