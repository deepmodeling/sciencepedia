Based on the molecularity of the proposed elementary step, the reaction is expected to follow first-order kinetics. To verify this, the concentration of reactant A, denoted as $[A]$, is measured at various times $t$. According to the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction, a plot of $\\ln[A]$ versus $t$ should yield a straight line with a slope equal to the negative of the rate constant, $-k$.\n\nUpon plotting the experimental data, the chemist observes that the plot is not perfectly linear. Instead, it exhibits a slight but consistent upward curvature, meaning the curve is concave up. This indicates that the magnitude of the slope becomes smaller as time increases; in other words, the reaction slows down more than would be expected for a simple irreversible first-order process.\n\nWhich of the following kinetic schemes provides the most direct and simple explanation for this observed deviation from ideal first-order behavior?\n\nA.
