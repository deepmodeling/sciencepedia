PbS₃", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the most thermally stable sulfide of lead (Pb) by considering periodic trends for heavy p-block elements.\n\n1.  **Identify the element and its position in the periodic table:** Lead (Pb) is in Group 14 and Period 6. Its electron configuration is $[\\text{Xe}] 4f^{14} 5d^{10} 6s^2 6p^2$. As a member of Group 14, its highest possible oxidation state (the group oxidation state) is +4, which would involve the loss of its four valence electrons (the $6s^2$ and $6p^2$ electrons).\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant periodic trend for heavy p-block elements:** The key trend for heavy elements in the p-block (like Pb, Tl, Bi) is the **inert pair effect**. This effect describes the increasing reluctance of the outermost s-electrons (in this case, the $6s^2$ electrons of lead) to participate in chemical bonding as one moves down a group. The poor shielding of the nuclear charge by the intervening d- and f-orbitals (here, $4f$ and $5d$) leads to a stronger attraction of the $6s$ electrons to the nucleus, making them more difficult to remove or share.\n\n3.  **Apply the inert pair effect to lead:** Due to the inert pair effect, the oxidation state that is two less than the group oxidation state becomes progressively more stable for heavier elements. For lead (Group 14, group oxidation state +4), this means the +2 oxidation state is significantly more stable than the +4 oxidation state. The +2 state corresponds to the loss of only the $6p^2$ electrons, while the \"inert pair\" of $6s^2$ electrons remains with the atom.\n\n4.  **Determine the formula for the sulfides corresponding to the common oxidation states:** Sulfur (S) is in Group 16 and typically forms a sulfide anion with a charge of -2 ($\\text{S}^{2-}$).\n    *   For lead in the +2 oxidation state ($\\text{Pb}^{2+}$), charge neutrality requires one $\\text{Pb}^{2+}$ ion for every one $\\text{S}^{2-}$ ion. This gives the formula **$\\text{PbS}$**.\n    *   For lead in the +4 oxidation state ($\\text{Pb}^{4+}$), charge neutrality requires one $\\text{Pb}^{4+}$ ion for every two $\\text{S}^{2-}$ ions. This gives the formula **$\\text{PbS}_2$**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the options based on stability:**\n    *   **A. $\\text{PbS}$:** This compound contains lead in its stable +2 oxidation state.\n    *   **B. $\\text{PbS}_2$:** This compound contains lead in its less stable +4 oxidation state. Lead(IV) sulfide is known to exist but readily decomposes to lead(II) sulfide and sulfur upon heating ($\\text{PbS}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{PbS} + \\text{S}$), indicating it is less thermally stable.\n    *   **C. $\\text{Pb}_2\\text{S}$:** This would require lead to be in a +1 oxidation state ($2 \\times (+1) + (-2) = 0$). The +1 oxidation state is not common or stable for lead.\n    *   **D. $\\text{Pb}_2\\text{S}_3$:** This would require lead to be in a +3 oxidation state ($2 \\times (+3) + 3 \\times (-2) = 0$). The +3 oxidation state is also not stable for lead.\n    *   **E. $\\text{PbS}_3$:** This would imply lead in a +6 oxidation state, which is impossible as lead only has 4 valence electrons.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the inert pair effect, the +2 oxidation state is the most stable for lead.

Two separate, parallel experiments are set up. In the first experiment, a sample of pure metallic antimony is allowed to react with an excess of dry chlorine gas (Cl₂). In the second experiment, a sample of pure metallic bismuth is treated under identical conditions, reacting with an excess of dry chlorine gas.

Sb₂Cl₃ and Bi₂Cl₅", "solution": "This problem requires an understanding of the periodic trends in oxidation states for p-block elements, specifically the inert pair effect in Group 15. The elements in Group 15, which includes antimony (Sb) and bismuth (Bi), have a valence electron configuration of $ns^2 np^3$. This allows them to exhibit several oxidation states, with +3 (from losing the three p electrons) and +5 (from losing all five valence electrons) being the most common.\n\nThe inert pair effect describes the increasing reluctance of the $ns^2$ valence electrons to be removed or participate in covalent bonding as one moves down a p-block group. This effect becomes significant for heavier elements (periods 5 and 6) due to the poor shielding of the nuclear charge by the intervening d and f orbitals. This poor shielding leads to a higher effective nuclear charge experienced by the $ns^2$ electrons, contracting their orbital and making them more difficult to ionize. Consequently, the lower oxidation state (Group Number - 2) becomes more stable relative to the higher oxidation state (Group Number) for heavier elements.\n\nLet's apply this principle to the two elements in question.\n\n**Antimony (Sb):**\nAntimony is in Period 5 of Group 15. For antimony, the inert pair effect is present but not dominant. While the +3 oxidation state exists (in $\\text{SbCl}_3$), the +5 oxidation state is also readily accessible and stable, especially when reacting with a strong oxidizing agent like chlorine. Given that an excess of chlorine gas is used, the conditions are strongly oxidizing, driving antimony to its highest possible and stable oxidation state. Therefore, antimony will be oxidized to the +5 state.\nThe balanced chemical reaction is:\n$$2 \\text{Sb}(s) + 5 \\text{Cl}_2(g) \\rightarrow 2 \\text{SbCl}_5(s)$$\nThe primary product is antimony(V) chloride, $\\text{SbCl}_5$.\n\n**Bismuth (Bi):**\nBismuth is in Period 6 of Group 15, directly below antimony. For bismuth, the inert pair effect is much more pronounced. The $6s^2$ electrons are held very tightly to the nucleus and are thus \"inert\". As a result, the +3 oxidation state is significantly more stable and common for bismuth than the +5 oxidation state. While bismuth(V) compounds can be synthesized, they are extremely powerful oxidizing agents and are generally unstable. Bismuth(V) chloride ($\\text{BiCl}_5$) is particularly unstable and decomposes even well below room temperature into $\\text{BiCl}_3$ and $\\text{Cl}_2$.
