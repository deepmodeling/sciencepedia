Solving this is the first step toward seeing electron configurations as a roadmap to an atom's properties [@problem_id:2293636].", "problem": "Consider a neutral atom in its ground state.

The azimuthal quantum number $l=1$ corresponds to a $p$ subshell, so this specifies the $3p$ subshell. The maximum occupancy of a subshell with azimuthal quantum number $l$ is $2(2l+1)$ electrons; for $l=1$ this is $2(2\\cdot 1+1)=6$, so “completely filled” means $3p^6$.\n\nA ground-state neutral atom with a filled $3p$ subshell has closed shells up through $n=3$, i.e., the electron configuration includes $[\\text{Ar}] = 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$, which accounts for $18$ electrons.\n\nNext, the statement says the atom has exactly one electron in its highest-energy occupied subshell, characterized by principal quantum number $n=4$. By the aufbau principle and the $n+l$ rule, orbitals fill in order of increasing $n+l$, and for equal $n+l$, lower $n$ fills first. For $4s$, $n+l=4+0=4$, whereas for $3d$, $n+l=3+2=5$. Thus $4s$ fills before $3d$. Having exactly one electron in the highest-energy occupied subshell with $n=4$ therefore corresponds to $4s^1$ as the valence configuration.\n\nCombining both pieces, the configuration is $[\\text{Ar}]\\,4s^1$, which contains $18+1=19$ electrons.
