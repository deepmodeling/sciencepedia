This first exercise challenges you to apply concepts like effective nuclear charge, atomic radius, and inter-electron repulsion to predict the electron affinities of oxygen, fluorine, and sulfur.

It is formally defined as the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a neutral atom in the gaseous state to form a negative ion. A more negative (exothermic) energy change indicates a greater attraction for the electron, and thus a higher electron affinity.\n\nConsider the elements oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and sulfur (S). While general periodic trends provide a useful guide, specific electronic configurations can lead to important exceptions. Analyze the interplay between effective nuclear charge, atomic size, and electron-electron repulsion for these three elements.\n\nBased on these principles, which of the following options correctly arranges the elements in order of **increasing** electron affinity (from least exothermic to most exothermic)?\n\nA. O < F < S\n\nB. S < O < F\n\nC. O < S < F\n\nD. F < O < S\n\nE. S < F < O", "solution": "The problem asks to arrange oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and sulfur (S) in order of increasing electron affinity. Increasing electron affinity corresponds to a more negative (more exothermic) energy change for the process $X(g) + e^{-} \\rightarrow X^{-}(g)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the general periodic trends for electron affinity.\n1.  **Across a period (from left to right):** Electron affinity generally becomes more exothermic. This is because the effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$) increases, while the atomic radius decreases. A stronger pull from the nucleus on the outermost electrons leads to a greater energy release when an electron is added.\n2.  **Down a group:** Electron affinity generally becomes less exothermic. This is because the incoming electron is added to a principal energy level that is farther from the nucleus. The increased distance and greater shielding from core electrons reduce the attraction of the nucleus for the new electron.\n\nNow, let's apply these trends and consider the specific electronic structures of O, F, and S.\n\n**Step 1: Compare Oxygen (O) and Fluorine (F)**\nOxygen (atomic number 8) and Fluorine (atomic number 9) are in the same period (period 2). The electron configuration of oxygen is $[He] 2s^2 2p^4$, and for fluorine, it is $[He] 2s^2 2p^5$.\nFollowing the trend across a period, fluorine is to the right of oxygen. Fluorine has a higher effective nuclear charge than oxygen. Adding an electron to fluorine completes its 2p subshell, resulting in a stable noble gas configuration for the $F^{-}$ ion ($[He] 2s^2 2p^6$). This is a highly favorable process. Therefore, fluorine has a significantly more exothermic electron affinity than oxygen.\nSo far, we have: O < F.\n\n**Step 2: Compare Oxygen (O) and Sulfur (S)**\nOxygen and Sulfur (atomic number 16) are in the same group (Group 16). Oxygen is in period 2, and sulfur is in period 3. The electron configuration of sulfur is $[Ne] 3s^2 3p^4$.\nAccording to the general trend down a group, electron affinity should become less exothermic. This would suggest that oxygen has a more exothermic electron affinity than sulfur (EA(O) > EA(S)). However, this is a well-known exception to the trend.\n\nThe reason for this exception lies in the electron density of the valence shell. Oxygen is a very small atom with its valence electrons in the 2p orbitals. The addition of an extra electron into the already partially filled and compact 2p subshell leads to significant electron-electron repulsion. This repulsion destabilizes the resulting $O^{-}$ ion, making the process less exothermic than it would otherwise be.\n\nSulfur is a larger atom with its valence electrons in the more diffuse 3p orbitals. The incoming electron enters the 3p subshell. Because the 3p orbitals are larger than the 2p orbitals, the existing valence electrons are more spread out. This results in significantly less electron-electron repulsion when the new electron is added compared to the case of oxygen. The effect of reduced electron-electron repulsion in sulfur is strong enough to outweigh the fact that the electron is being added to a higher energy level (n=3 vs n=2). Consequently, the electron affinity of sulfur is more exothermic than that of oxygen.\nSo, we have the order: O < S.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the complete order**\nFrom Step 1, we know O < F.\nFrom Step 2, we know O < S. This makes oxygen the element with the least exothermic electron affinity.\nNow we need to compare sulfur and fluorine.\nFluorine is in period 2, and sulfur is in period 3. Fluorine is in Group 17, while sulfur is in Group 16. Fluorine's position at the top-right of this group of elements (excluding noble gases) suggests it will have a very high electron affinity. Its high effective nuclear charge and the immense stability gained by achieving a noble gas configuration upon accepting an electron make its electron affinity the most exothermic of the three. Even though sulfur has a more exothermic EA than oxygen, the factors making fluorine's EA so high are dominant.\nActual experimental values confirm this:\nEA(O) = -141 kJ/mol\nEA(S) = -200 kJ/mol\nEA(F) = -328 kJ/mol\n\nThe order of increasing electron affinity (from least exothermic to most exothermic) is Oxygen < Sulfur < Fluorine.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct option**\nThe derived order is O < S < F. This corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2278710"}, {"introduction": "The predictive power of chemistry lies in understanding how subtle differences in electron configuration can lead to significant changes in reactivity. This practice explores another key exception to the general periodic trend for electron affinity, focusing on the enhanced stability of half-filled subshells [@problem_id:2278747]. By comparing neighboring elements phosphorus and sulfur, you will develop a more refined model for predicting chemical behavior that goes beyond simple left-to-right trends.", "problem": "In the field of materials science, the ability of an element to accept an electron in the gas phase is a critical parameter for designing novel semiconductors and ionic compounds. This property is quantified by the electron affinity (EA), defined as the energy change when a neutral atom in the gaseous state gains an electron to form a negative ion. A more negative (i.e., more exothermic) EA value signifies a more stable anion and a greater willingness of the atom to accept an electron.\n\nConsider the two neighboring third-period elements, phosphorus ($P$, atomic number 15) and sulfur ($S$, atomic number 16). Based on fundamental principles of atomic structure and electron configuration, predict which process, the formation of a gas-phase phosphide ion ($P^{-}$) or the formation of a gas-phase sulfide ion ($S^{-}$), is more energetically favorable. Select the option below that correctly identifies the more favorable process and provides the most accurate reasoning.\n\nA. The formation of $P^{-}$ is more favorable. The general periodic trend for electron affinity is that it becomes more negative (more favorable) from right to left across a period, making phosphorus more likely to accept an electron than sulfur.\n\nB. The formation of $S^{-}$ is more favorable. Adding an electron to a sulfur atom results in a completely filled $3p$ subshell, which is an exceptionally stable noble gas configuration.\n\nC. The formation of $P^{-}$ is more favorable. A neutral phosphorus atom has three electrons in its $3p$ subshell, and adding one more electron creates a half-filled $3p^{4}$ configuration, which has special stability.\n\nD. The formation of $S^{-}$ is more favorable. While the general trend suggests increasing EA across a period, the neutral phosphorus atom possesses a uniquely stable, half-filled $3p$ subshell. Adding an electron disrupts this stability and introduces electron-electron repulsion into a previously empty orbital space. Sulfur, on the other hand, readily accepts an electron to move closer to a stable, filled $p$-subshell.\n\nE. The formation of $P^{-}$ and $S^{-}$ are approximately equally favorable. Since they are adjacent in the periodic table, the difference in their effective nuclear charge is minimal, leading to very similar electron affinities.", "solution": "Electron affinity (EA) is the energy change for $X(\\text{g}) + e^{-} \\rightarrow X^{-}(\\text{g})$. A more negative EA indicates a more favorable (more exothermic) formation of the anion.\n\nAcross a period from left to right, the general trend is that EA becomes more negative due to increasing effective nuclear charge; however, there are well-known exceptions associated with half-filled and filled subshell stabilities that can make EA less negative than the trend would suggest.\n\nWrite the valence electron configurations:\n- Phosphorus: $[Ne]\\,3s^{2}3p^{3}$, which is a half-filled $3p$ subshell with three unpaired electrons in three degenerate $p$ orbitals, stabilized by exchange energy.\n- Sulfur: $[Ne]\\,3s^{2}3p^{4}$, which has one paired and two unpaired electrons in the $3p$ orbitals.\n\nConsider adding one electron:\n- For phosphorus: $P(\\text{g}) + e^{-} \\rightarrow P^{-}(\\text{g})$ changes $3p^{3} \\rightarrow 3p^{4}$. The added electron must pair in one of the $p$ orbitals, introducing pairing (electron-electron) repulsion and disrupting the uniquely stable half-filled $3p$ configuration. This reduces the magnitude of the exothermicity, making the EA less negative than the general trend would predict.\n- For sulfur: $S(\\text{g}) + e^{-} \\rightarrow S^{-}(\\text{g})$ changes $3p^{4} \\rightarrow 3p^{5}$. Although pairing repulsion is still present, sulfur already lacks the special half-filled stability, and the added electron moves the configuration closer to the closed $3p^{6}$ subshell. Combined with the generally higher effective nuclear charge relative to phosphorus, the EA for sulfur is more negative than that of phosphorus.\n\nTherefore, forming $S^{-}$ is more energetically favorable than forming $P^{-}$. Evaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the trend is more negative EA from left to right, not right to left.\n- B is incorrect because adding one electron to sulfur yields $3p^{5}$, not a filled $3p^{6}$ subshell.\n- C is incorrect because $3p^{4}$ is not a half-filled configuration; the half-filled stability applies to neutral phosphorus ($3p^{3}$), and adding an electron removes that special stability.\n- D is correct in identifying that $S^{-}$ formation is more favorable and that phosphorus’s half-filled $3p$ subshell makes adding an electron comparatively less favorable.\n- E is incorrect because the half-filled subshell exception leads to a meaningful difference between phosphorus and sulfur.\n\nHence, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2278747"}, {"introduction": "While the addition of a single electron to a neutral atom is often energetically favorable, what happens when we try to add a second?
