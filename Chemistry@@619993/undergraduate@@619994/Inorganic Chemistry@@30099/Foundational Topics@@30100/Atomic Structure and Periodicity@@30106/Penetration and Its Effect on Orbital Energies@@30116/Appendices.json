In a hydrogenic (one-electron) atom, orbital energies depend solely on the principal quantum number, $n$. However, in multi-electron atoms, electron-electron repulsion leads to a more complex energy level diagram where orbitals with the same $n$ but different angular momentum quantum numbers, $l$, are no longer degenerate. The student is tasked with determining the relative energy ordering of the 5s, 4d, and 4f orbitals.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete physical explanation for the observed energy ordering of these three orbitals in a typical neutral, heavy multi-electron atom?\n\nA. The energy ordering is $(4d = 4f) < 5s$. In a multi-electron atom, the hydrogenic degeneracy for a given principal quantum number $n$ is largely preserved, and the energy is primarily determined by $n$.\n\nB. The energy ordering is $5s < 4d < 4f$. The 5s orbital is lowest in energy despite its higher principal quantum number because its shape allows for significant penetration inside the inner electron shells, leading to a higher effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$). The 4f orbital is higher in energy than the 4d orbital because its shape is more diffuse, causing it to be more effectively shielded from the nucleus.\n\nC. The energy ordering is $4f < 4d < 5s$. This is because the energy of an orbital is determined by the sum of its principal and angular momentum quantum numbers ($n+l$). The smaller the value of $n+l$, the lower the energy.\n\nD. The energy ordering is $4d < 5s < 4f$. The 4d orbital has the lowest energy due to its low principal quantum number. The 5s orbital is higher in energy than 4d but lower than 4f because its spherical symmetry makes it uniquely stable compared to the f-orbital.\n\nE. The energy ordering is $5s < 4f < 4d$. The 5s orbital's high degree of penetration makes it the most stable. The 4f orbital is more stable than the 4d orbital because its higher angular momentum allows it to better avoid other electrons, reducing repulsion.", "solution": "In a hydrogenic atom with a single electron, the stationary-state energies depend only on the principal quantum number $n$ via\n$$\nE_{n}=-\\frac{R_{\\infty}Z^{2}}{n^{2}},\n$$\nso all orbitals with the same $n$ are degenerate. In a neutral, heavy multi-electron atom, electron-electron repulsion and shielding lift this degeneracy. A standard first approximation that captures the qualitative ordering replaces $Z$ by an orbital-dependent effective nuclear charge $Z_{\\text{eff}}(n,l)$:\n$$\nE_{n l}\\approx -\\frac{R_{\\infty}\\,Z_{\\text{eff}}(n,l)^{2}}{n^{2}}.\n$$\nHere $Z_{\\text{eff}}(n,l)=Z-\\sigma(n,l)$, with $\\sigma(n,l)$ the shielding constant. The size of $\\sigma(n,l)$ depends on how much the orbital penetrates the inner electron density.

The qualitative penetration hierarchy is\n$$\n\\text{s}>\\text{p}>\\text{d}>\\text{f}.\n$$\n\nApply this to the comparison of $4d$ and $4f$. Since $n=4$ for both, the $n$-dependence in $E_{n l}$ is identical, and the energy ordering is governed by $Z_{\\text{eff}}(4d)$ versus $Z_{\\text{eff}}(4f)$. Because $l=2$ (d) penetrates more than $l=3$ (f), one has\n$$\nZ_{\\text{eff}}(4d)>Z_{\\text{eff}}(4f)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad E_{4d}<E_{4f}.\n$$\n\nNow compare $5s$ and $4d$, which differ in both $n$ and $l$. The $5s$ orbital ($l=0$) has very strong penetration; its radial wavefunction has amplitude near the nucleus (no centrifugal barrier), so it experiences relatively weak shielding and a large $Z_{\\text{eff}}(5s)$. The $4d$ orbital ($l=2$) is kept away from the nucleus by the centrifugal barrier, resulting in stronger shielding and a smaller $Z_{\\text{eff}}(4d)$. Using the approximate energy expression, $5s$ will lie below $4d$ provided\n$$\n\\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}}(5s)^{2}}{5^{2}}>\\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}}(4d)^{2}}{4^{2}}\\quad\\Leftrightarrow\\quad \\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}}(5s)}{Z_{\\text{eff}}(4d)}>\\frac{5}{4}.\n$$\nIn typical neutral, heavy atoms, the strong $s$-orbital penetration makes $Z_{\\text{eff}}(5s)$ sufficiently larger than $Z_{\\text{eff}}(4d)$ to satisfy this inequality. Empirically, this is reflected in the observed filling sequence after krypton: $5s$ is occupied (e.g., Rb, Sr) before $4d$ begins to fill (e.g., Y, Zr), which is consistent with $E_{5s}<E_{4d}$.\n\nCombining both comparisons gives the ordering\n$$\n5s<4d<4f,\n$$\nwith the physical reasons being (i) penetration and the resulting larger $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ for $5s$ despite its larger $n$, and (ii) within the same principal shell $n=4$, higher $l$ (from d to f) reduces penetration and lowers $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, raising the energy.\n\nEvaluate the statements:\n- A is incorrect because the $n$-degeneracy is not preserved; $l$ matters strongly.\n- B states $5s<4d<4f$ and correctly attributes it to penetration (larger $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ for $5s$) and stronger shielding for $4f$ than $4d$; this matches the analysis above.\n- C misorders the levels; applying the $n+l$ guideline would actually give $5s$ lowest, then $4d$, then $4f$, not the reverse.\n- D incorrectly places $4d$ below $5s$, ignoring the dominant penetration of $5s$ in neutral heavy atoms.\n- E incorrectly claims $4f<4d$ and misattributes stabilization to reduced electron-electron repulsion while neglecting the dominant effect of reduced penetration (and thus reduced $Z_{\\text{eff}}$) for $4f$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2277929"}, {"introduction": "To move from a qualitative appreciation of shielding to a quantitative estimate, chemists have developed useful models.
