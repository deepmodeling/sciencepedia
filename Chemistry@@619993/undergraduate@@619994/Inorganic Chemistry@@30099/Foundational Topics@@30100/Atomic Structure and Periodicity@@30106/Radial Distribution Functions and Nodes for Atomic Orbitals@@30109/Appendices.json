It is mathematically defined as $P(r) = 4\\pi r^{2}[R(r)]^{2}$, where $R(r)$ is the radial part of the atomic orbital's wavefunction.\n\nThe student's sketch correctly shows a single peak, but it also incorrectly depicts a radial node at the nucleus ($r=0$). The instructor points out that claiming a radial node exists at $r=0$ for a 2p orbital represents a fundamental conceptual misunderstanding.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for why it is conceptually incorrect to describe the point at $r=0$ as a radial node for the RDF of a 2p orbital?\n\nA. The 2p orbital has one radial node, and by definition, this node must be located precisely at the nucleus.\n\nB. A radial node is a sphere at a radius $r > 0$ where the probability of finding an electron is zero. The RDF is always zero at $r=0$ for any non-s orbital because the volume of the enclosing spherical shell approaches zero, which is a trivial condition and not a node.\n\nC. All p-orbitals are characterized by having zero radial nodes; their only node is an angular nodal plane passing through the nucleus.\n\nD. The wavefunction, $\\psi$, for a 2p orbital is at its maximum value at the nucleus ($r=0$), so the probability and the RDF cannot be zero there.\n\nE.
