Let's verify this for the given ions.\n- A neutral potassium atom (K) has an atomic number of 19, meaning it has 19 protons and 19 electrons. To form the cation $\\text{K}^+$, it loses one electron. Therefore, $\\text{K}^+$ has 19 protons and $19 - 1 = 18$ electrons.\n- A neutral chlorine atom (Cl) has an atomic number of 17, meaning it has 17 protons and 17 electrons. To form the anion $\\text{Cl}^-$, it gains one electron. Therefore, $\\text{Cl}^-$ has 17 protons and $17 + 1 = 18$ electrons.\nBoth $\\text{K}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$ have 18 electrons, confirming they are an isoelectronic pair. Their electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$, which is the same as the noble gas Argon.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors determining ionic radius.\nThe radius of an atom or ion is determined by the balance between the attractive force of the positively charged nucleus on the negatively charged electrons and the repulsive forces among the electrons themselves. For an isoelectronic series, the number of electrons is constant. This means that the effects of electron-electron repulsion and shielding by inner-shell electrons are roughly similar across the series. The dominant factor that changes is the nuclear charge, which is the number of protons in the nucleus.\n\nStep 3: Compare the nuclear charges of $\\text{K}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$.\n- The potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$) has 19 protons in its nucleus.\n- The chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) has 17 protons in its nucleus.\n\nStep 4: Relate nuclear charge to ionic radius.\nThe nucleus of the potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$) has a charge of $+19$, while the nucleus of the chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) has a charge of $+17$. Both of these nuclei are attracting the same number of electrons (18). The greater positive charge of the $\\text{K}^+$ nucleus exerts a stronger electrostatic pull on its 18 electrons compared to the pull exerted by the $\\text{Cl}^-$ nucleus. This stronger attraction pulls the electron cloud in $\\text{K}^+$ closer to the nucleus, resulting in a smaller ionic radius. Conversely, the weaker pull from the 17 protons in $\\text{Cl}^-$ on its 18 electrons allows the electron cloud to be less tightly bound and occupy a larger volume. Therefore, the ionic radius of $\\text{Cl}^-$ is larger than that of $\\text{K}^+$. This concept is often described in terms of effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff}$); for an isoelectronic series, the species with more protons has a higher $Z_{eff}$ and is smaller.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. The chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) is larger than the potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$) because it has fewer protons, resulting in a weaker effective nuclear charge pulling on the electron cloud. This matches our reasoning perfectly.\n- B. The potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$) is larger than the chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) because the parent atom, potassium, is in a higher period. This reasoning is flawed. While K is larger than Cl as neutral atoms, this trend does not directly apply to their ions in an isoelectronic series, where nuclear charge is the dominant factor.\n- C. The potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$) and the chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) have identical radii because they are isoelectronic. This is incorrect. Being isoelectronic does not guarantee identical radii because the nuclear charges are different.\n- D. The chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) is larger than the potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$) because as a halogen, its atoms naturally have a larger radius than alkali metals. This statement about neutral atoms is incorrect; alkali metals (left side of a period) are larger than halogens (right side of the same period).\n- E. The potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$) is larger than the chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$) because cations are generally larger than anions. This is a false statement. Cations are smaller than their parent atoms, and anions are larger than their parent atoms. There is no general rule that cations are larger than anions.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only statement that correctly identifies the larger ion and provides the correct physical reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2278484"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative reasoning is powerful, chemists often need quantitative estimates for properties like bond lengths.
