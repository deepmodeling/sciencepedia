Elements within the same group typically have the same number of valence electrons, which dictates their chemical behavior. Consider an element located in Group 13 of the periodic table.

General valence configuration: $ns^{2}np^{1}$; Block: d-block", "solution": "The problem asks for the general valence electron configuration and the periodic table block for an element in Group 13. We can determine this by understanding the relationship between an element's group number and its electronic structure.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of valence electrons. For main group elements, the last digit of the group number (in the 1-18 naming convention) corresponds to the number of valence electrons. For Group 13, this means there are 3 valence electrons. These are the electrons in the outermost shell, which has the principal quantum number $n$.\n\nNext, we determine how these valence electrons fill the available orbitals. According to the Aufbau principle, electrons occupy the lowest energy orbitals available. For any given principal quantum number $n$ (where $n \\geq 2$), the $s$ orbital is lower in energy than the $p$ orbitals of the same shell.\n\nThe first two of the three valence electrons will fill the $ns$ orbital. This gives the configuration $ns^{2}$. The third and final valence electron must then occupy the next available orbital of lowest energy, which is one of the $np$ orbitals. This adds $np^{1}$ to the configuration.\n\nCombining these, the complete general valence electron configuration for an element in Group 13 is $ns^{2}np^{1}$.\n\nNow, we must identify the block of the periodic table. The block is determined by the subshell (s, p, d, or f) that holds the highest-energy electron, also known as the differentiating electron. In the configuration $ns^{2}np^{1}$, the last electron added is in a $p$ orbital. Therefore, all elements in Group 13 (except for the recently discovered Nihonium, which is a transactinide) belong to the p-block.\n\nWith both pieces of information, we have:\n- General valence configuration: $ns^{2}np^{1}$\n- Block: p-block\n\nWe can now compare this result with the given options.\n- A. General valence configuration: $ns^{2}$; Block: s-block. This describes Group 2 elements (alkaline earth metals). Incorrect.\n- B. General valence configuration: $ns^{2}np^{1}$; Block: p-block. This matches our derivation. Correct.\n- C. General valence configuration: $ns^{2}np^{3}$; Block: p-block. This describes Group 15 elements (pnictogens). Incorrect.\n- D. General valence configuration: $ns^{1}$; Block: s-block. This describes Group 1 elements (alkali metals). Incorrect.\n- E. General valence configuration: $ns^{2}np^{1}$; Block: d-block. The configuration is correct, but the block is wrong. The d-block is for elements whose differentiating electron is in a d-orbital. Incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2278249"}, {"introduction": "While predicting properties from an element's position is crucial, chemists often face the reverse challenge: identifying an element based on its observed ionic state.

It specifically tests your understanding of electron configurations for transition metals, where the order of electron removal during ionization is a key concept.", "problem": "A new class of materials is being investigated for applications in spintronics, a field of electronics that utilizes the intrinsic spin of the electron. In one such material, a specific transition metal, which we will call element X, is found to exist in a stable dipositive cation state (X$^{2+}$). Spectroscopic analysis of this X$^{2+}$ ion has determined its ground-state electron configuration to be $[Ar] 3d^5$.\n\nFrom this information, determine the block and group number of the neutral element X in the periodic table.

The symbol $[Ar]$ represents the electron configuration of Argon, which is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$. Argon has an atomic number of 18, meaning it has 18 electrons.\nThe configuration $[Ar] 3d^5$ means the X$^{2+}$ ion has the 18 electrons of the Argon core plus 5 electrons in the $3d$ orbital.\nTotal number of electrons in X$^{2+}$ = $18 + 5 = 23$ electrons.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of electrons in the neutral atom.\nThe ion has a charge of $2+$, which indicates that the neutral atom X lost two electrons to form the X$^{2+}$ cation.\nTherefore, the number of electrons in the neutral atom X is the number of electrons in the ion plus the two electrons that were lost.\nNumber of electrons in neutral atom X = (electrons in X$^{2+}$) + 2 = $23 + 2 = 25$ electrons.\n\nStep 3: Identify the element and its neutral electron configuration.\nFor a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, which is the atomic number (Z). Thus, element X has an atomic number Z = 25. The element with atomic number 25 is Manganese (Mn).\n\nNow, we write the ground-state electron configuration for the neutral atom with 25 electrons, following the Aufbau principle (filling orbitals in order of increasing energy: $1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, ...$).\nThe configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^5$.\nThis is commonly written with the Argon core as $[Ar] 4s^2 3d^5$.\nWe can verify this is correct by considering the ionization process. To form the X$^{2+}$ ion, the two electrons from the outermost shell (the shell with the highest principal quantum number, n) are removed first. In this case, the outermost shell is n=4. So, the two electrons in the $4s$ orbital are removed, resulting in the configuration $[Ar] 3d^5$, which matches the information given in the problem.\n\nStep 4: Determine the block of the element.\nThe block of an element in the periodic table is determined by the type of orbital that holds the highest-energy electrons (the last electrons added according to the Aufbau principle). For Manganese (Z=25), the electron configuration is $[Ar] 4s^2 3d^5$. The last electrons are placed in the $3d$ orbital. Therefore, element X belongs to the d-block.\n\nStep 5: Determine the group of the element.\nFor d-block elements (the transition metals), the group number can be found by summing the number of electrons in the outermost s-orbital and the d-orbitals of the preceding shell.\nIn this case, the configuration is $[Ar] 4s^2 3d^5$.\nNumber of electrons in the outermost s-orbital ($4s$) = 2.\nNumber of electrons in the d-orbital of the preceding shell ($3d$) = 5.\nGroup Number = $2 + 5 = 7$.\nSo, element X is in Group 7.\n\nStep 6: Match the findings with the given options.\nThe element X is in the d-block and Group 7. This corresponds to option D.\nLet's analyze the incorrect options:\nA. p-block, Group 15: Incorrect block and group.\nB. d-block, Group 5: Incorrect group. This would be the result if one only considered the 5 d-electrons.\nC. s-block, Group 2: Incorrect block and group.
