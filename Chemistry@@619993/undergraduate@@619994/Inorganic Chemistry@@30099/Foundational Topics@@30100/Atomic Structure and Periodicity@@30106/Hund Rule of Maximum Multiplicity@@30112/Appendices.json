By dissecting a proposed electron arrangement that is incorrect, you will reinforce the core concept that the lowest energy state is achieved not just by spreading electrons across degenerate orbitals, but by aligning their spins to achieve the maximum possible total spin, a state known as maximum multiplicity.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with determining the ground-state electron configuration for a gaseous ion that has a valence configuration of $d^4$.

The arrangement violates Hund's rule because all five d-orbitals must contain at least one electron.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must analyze the student's proposed electron arrangement in the context of the rules governing electron configurations, specifically Hund's rules for determining the ground state of an atom or ion.\n\nThe system is a $d^4$ configuration, meaning we have four electrons to place in five degenerate d-orbitals. Hund's rules provide a prescription for arranging these electrons to achieve the lowest possible energy state. The primary rule, known as Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, can be broken down into two practical steps for degenerate orbitals:\n1.  Place one electron in each orbital before any pairing occurs. This minimizes electron-electron repulsion.\n2.  The spins of all unpaired electrons in singly occupied orbitals must be parallel (i.e., they must all have the same spin quantum number, either all $m_s = +1/2$ or all $m_s = -1/2$). This maximizes the total spin of the system, which leads to a lower energy state due to exchange energy.\n\nLet's examine the student's proposed arrangement:\n-   **Orbital Occupancy:** The student places one electron each in four different d-orbitals ($m_l = -2, -1, 0, +1$), leaving one orbital empty. This part of the arrangement correctly follows the first step of Hund's rule. The electrons are spread out as much as possible.\n-   **Electron Spin:** The student assigns two electrons as spin-up ($m_s = +1/2$) and two as spin-down ($m_s = -1/2$). This is where the error lies.\n\nAccording to the second part of Hund's rule, for the ground state, all four of these unpaired electrons should have parallel spins. For example, they should all be spin-up.\n-   **Correct Ground State Spins:** $m_s = +1/2, +1/2, +1/2, +1/2$. The total spin quantum number would be $S = \\sum m_s = 4 \\times (+1/2) = 2$.\n-   **Student's Proposed Spins:** $m_s = +1/2, +1/2, -1/2, -1/2$. The total spin quantum number for this configuration is $S = \\sum m_s = (+1/2) + (+1/2) + (-1/2) + (-1/2) = 0$.\n\nThe \"multiplicity\" of a state is given by the formula $2S+1$.\n-   For the correct ground state, the multiplicity is $2(2)+1 = 5$ (a quintet state).\n-   For the student's proposed state, the multiplicity is $2(0)+1 = 1$ (a singlet state).\n\nSince the ground state is achieved by maximizing the multiplicity, the student's proposed arrangement, which has a total spin $S=0$, is an excited state, not the ground state. It specifically violates the part of Hund's rule that requires maximizing the total spin.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n-   **A. The arrangement violates the rule of maximum multiplicity because the total spin quantum number is not maximized.** This statement is correct. The student's arrangement has $S=0$, whereas the ground state requires $S=2$. This failure to maximize spin is the direct violation of Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity.\n-   **B. The arrangement violates the Aufbau principle because electrons must completely fill lower energy subshells first.** This is incorrect. The problem specifies a $d^4$ valence configuration, so we are only concerned with arranging electrons *within* the d-subshell, not the overall filling order of the atom from the 1s orbital upwards.\n-   **C. The arrangement violates the Pauli exclusion principle because two electrons have the same spin quantum number.** This is incorrect. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same four quantum numbers ($n, l, m_l, m_s$). In the student's configuration, all four electrons are in different orbitals (different $m_l$ values), so they are guaranteed to have different sets of quantum numbers, regardless of their spin. The principle is not violated.\n-   **D. The arrangement violates Hund's rule because electrons must pair up in the lowest energy d-orbital before occupying other orbitals.** This statement describes the opposite of Hund's rule. For degenerate orbitals, electrons occupy them singly first to minimize repulsion.\n-   **E. The arrangement violates Hund's rule because all five d-orbitals must contain at least one electron.** This is an incorrect interpretation of the rule. Hund's rule requires filling orbitals singly *up to the number of electrons available*. For a $d^4$ configuration, only four orbitals will be singly occupied; the fifth remains empty in the ground state.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the violation is that the total spin was not maximized, which is the core of Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2258216"}, {"introduction": "With a solid conceptual grasp of multiplicity, we can now apply Hund's rule to predict the electronic ground state of common chemical species.
