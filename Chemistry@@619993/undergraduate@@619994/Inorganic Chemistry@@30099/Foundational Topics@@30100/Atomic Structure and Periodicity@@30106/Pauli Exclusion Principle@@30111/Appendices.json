The quantum numbers are the principal quantum number ($n$), the azimuthal quantum number ($l$), the magnetic quantum number ($m_l$), and the spin quantum number ($m_s$). These numbers must obey the following rules: $n$ must be a positive integer; $l$ can range from $0$ to $n-1$; $m_l$ can range from $-l$ to $+l$; and $m_s$ can be either $+1/2$ or $-1/2$. The assignment of electrons to orbitals must follow the Aufbau principle, Hund's rule, and the Pauli exclusion principle to represent the ground state.\n\nThe student proposes the following list of quantum numbers for the 14 electrons:\n1.

Translating this into quantum numbers:\n- The two $1s$ electrons occupy $(n=1, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=\\pm \\frac{1}{2})$.\n- The two $2s$ electrons occupy $(n=2, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=\\pm \\frac{1}{2})$.\n- The six $2p$ electrons occupy the $l=1$ manifold with $m_{l}=-1,0,1$, each orbital receiving first one electron with $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ and then one with $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$, in accordance with Hund’s rule and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n- The two $3s$ electrons occupy $(n=3, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=\\pm \\frac{1}{2})$.\n- The two $3p$ electrons, in the ground state, must follow Hund’s rule by occupying two different $3p$ orbitals (two different $m_{l}$ values among $-1,0,1$) with parallel spins, for example $(n=3, l=1, m_{l}=-1, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2})$ and $(n=3, l=1, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nNow compare with the student’s list.

Entries 11–12 correctly assign $3s^{2}$ as $(3,0,0, +\\frac{1}{2})$ and $(3,0,0, -\\frac{1}{2})$. For the $3p$ electrons, entries 13 and 14 are both $(n=3, l=1, m_{l}=-1, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2})$. This assigns two electrons the identical set of four quantum numbers, which directly violates the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A claims a Hund’s rule violation because the two $3p$ electrons are paired in the same orbital instead of occupying separate orbitals with parallel spins. While the student indeed failed to distribute electrons among separate $3p$ orbitals (which would be a Hund’s rule issue), the stated reason “paired in the same orbital” normally implies opposite spins within one orbital; the student actually assigned identical spins and identical $m_{l}$, which is an even stronger violation of the Pauli principle. Thus A is not the most accurate identification of the flaw.\n- B is false because the $3s$ subshell is complete before any $3p$ assignment is made.\n- C is correct because entries 13 and 14 are identical in all four quantum numbers, violating the Pauli exclusion principle.\n- D is false because all $m_{l}$ values satisfy $|m_{l}| \\leq l$.\n- E is false because of the Pauli violation.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification of the flaw is the Pauli exclusion principle violation described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2277659"}, {"introduction": "Nature sometimes presents us with exceptions to simple rules, and the electron configuration of chromium is a classic example that often puzzles students.

The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...).\n2.  The angular momentum quantum number, $l$, can range from 0 to $n-1$. The value of $l$ corresponds to the orbital type: $l=0$ is an s-orbital, $l=1$ is a p-orbital, $l=2$ is a d-orbital, etc.\n3.  The magnetic quantum number, $m_l$, can range from $-l$ to $+l$ in integer steps.\n4.  The spin quantum number, $m_s$, can be either +1/2 or -1/2.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons within a single atom can have the same four quantum numbers ($n, l, m_l, m_s$).\n\nThe ground-state electron configuration of chromium (Cr) is given as [Ar] 4s¹ 3d⁵. This means:\n*   There is one electron in the 4s orbital. For a 4s orbital, $n=4$ and $l=0$. Since $l=0$, the only possible value for $m_l$ is 0. The spin $m_s$ can be +1/2 or -1/2. So, a valid set of quantum numbers for the 4s electron is (4, 0, 0, +1/2) or (4, 0, 0, -1/2).\n*   There are five electrons in the 3d orbitals. For a 3d orbital, $n=3$ and $l=2$. The possible values for $m_l$ are -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. According to Hund's rule, to maximize total spin, the five electrons will occupy the five different d-orbitals singly with parallel spins (e.g., all with $m_s = +1/2$). Therefore, a valid set of quantum numbers for any one of the 3d electrons would be of the form (3, 2, $m_l$, +1/2) where $m_l$ is one of {-2, -1, 0, +1, +2}.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A.

All quantum numbers are valid.\n*   The two sets of quantum numbers are different, so the Pauli exclusion principle is not violated. Both electrons are consistent with the [Ar] 4s¹ 3d⁵ ground-state configuration of chromium. This option is a valid representation.\n\n**B. Electron 1: (4, 0, 0, +1/2) and Electron 2: (4, 0, 0, +1/2)**\n*   Both sets of quantum numbers are identical.

While these two sets are distinct and valid, they would represent a filled $4s^2$ orbital. The ground-state configuration of chromium is 4s¹, not $4s^2$. The problem specifically asks to compare the 4s electron with a 3d electron. This option describes two electrons in the 4s orbital, which is not the ground state of Cr. Thus, it does not correctly represent the situation described.\n\n**D. Electron 1: (4, 0, 0, +1/2) and Electron 2: (3, 2, 3, +1/2)**\n*   Electron 1: ($n=4, l=0, m_l=0, m_s=+1/2$). This set is valid.\n*   Electron 2: ($n=3, l=2, m_l=3, m_s=+1/2$). For an electron with $l=2$ (a d-orbital), the magnetic quantum number $m_l$ can only take integer values from -2 to +2.

In this alternate reality, what is the maximum number of electrons that could occupy a single $p$-subshell?", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum electron capacity of a $p$-subshell in a hypothetical scenario where electrons are spin-$3/2$ fermions. To solve this, we must apply the Pauli exclusion principle, which dictates that each electron in the subshell must have a unique set of quantum numbers. The total capacity is the product of the number of available spatial orbitals and the number of available spin states.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of orbitals within a $p$-subshell. The type of subshell is determined by the azimuthal quantum number, $l$. For a $p$-subshell, the value of $l$ is universally defined as $l=1$. The number of orbitals within any subshell is given by the number of possible values for the magnetic quantum number, $m_l$. The allowed values for $m_l$ range from $-l$ to $+l$ in integer steps.\n\nFor a $p$-subshell where $l=1$, the possible values for $m_l$ are:\n$$m_l = -1, 0, +1$$\nThis gives a total of $2l+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$ distinct spatial orbitals in the $p$-subshell.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of possible spin states for each orbital. For a particle with a spin quantum number $s$, the spin magnetic quantum number, $m_s$, can take on values from $-s$ to $+s$ in integer steps. In our familiar universe, an electron has $s=1/2$, leading to $m_s = -1/2, +1/2$, which means there are 2 spin states per orbital.\n\nIn the hypothetical universe described in the problem, the electron is a spin-$3/2$ fermion, so $s=3/2$. The possible values for the spin magnetic quantum number, $m_s$, are:\n$$m_s = -\\frac{3}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{3}{2}$$\nThis gives a total of $2s+1 = 2(\\frac{3}{2})+1 = 3+1 = 4$ distinct spin states.\n\nAccording to the Pauli exclusion principle, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the subshell is the total number of unique quantum states available. This is calculated by multiplying the number of spatial orbitals by the number of spin states available within each orbital.\n\nMaximum capacity = (Number of orbitals) $\\times$ (Number of spin states per orbital)\nMaximum capacity = $3 \\times 4 = 12$\n\nTherefore, in this hypothetical universe, a $p$-subshell could hold a maximum of 12 electrons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "2277610"}]}
