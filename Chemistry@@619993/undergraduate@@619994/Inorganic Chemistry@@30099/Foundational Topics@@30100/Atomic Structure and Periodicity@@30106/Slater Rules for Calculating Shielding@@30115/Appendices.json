This simplification becomes progressively more inadequate as electrons are added to the $p$ orbitals across the period, leading to a systematic overestimation of $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and a quadratically amplified overestimation of the IE.\n\nB) Relativistic effects, which cause a contraction of inner shell orbitals, become increasingly significant with higher nuclear charge. This enhances the shielding from the core electrons, an effect not captured by the constant shielding parameters in Slater's rules, leading to a growing deviation.\n\nC) The model's primary failure is its underestimation of the shielding provided by electrons in the $(n-1)$ shell. The fixed shielding value of 0.85 does not account for the contraction of the $(n-1)$ shell as nuclear charge increases, causing the calculated $S$ to be increasingly too small across the period.\n\nD) The hydrogenic energy equation is only strictly valid for single-electron systems. Its application to multi-electron atoms is the sole source of error, and the percentage error increases across the period because the number of electron-electron interactions, which the equation fundamentally ignores, grows.\n\nE) The trend is primarily driven by the anomalous electron configurations and spin-pairing energies that occur at P and S.
