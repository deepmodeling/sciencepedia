Both Li⁺ and Mg²⁺ have high charge-to-radius ratios, giving them strong polarizing power which destabilizes the large nitrate anion.\n\nB. Lithium and magnesium have nearly identical electronegativity values, causing their nitrate salts to exhibit a similar degree of covalent character.\n\nC. The standard Gibbs free energy of formation for lithium oxide and magnesium oxide is significantly more negative than for their respective nitrites, making the oxide the only thermodynamically feasible product.\n\nD. Both lithium and magnesium atoms have relatively low first ionization energies compared to other elements in their respective periods, which facilitates the loss of electrons and formation of oxides.\n\nE.

The polarizing power of a cation increases with increasing charge and decreasing ionic radius, often summarized qualitatively as increasing with large $z$ and small $r$ for the cation. The nitrate anion $\\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$ is large and readily polarizable. Therefore, cations with high charge density (small radius and/or higher charge) strongly polarize $\\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$, destabilizing the nitrate and favoring decomposition pathways that produce $\\text{NO}_{2}$ and an oxide $\\text{O}^{2-}$ that binds the cation strongly.\n\nApplying this to magnesium, $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ has a relatively small radius and charge $+2$, so it has strong polarizing power. This polarizes $\\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$, facilitating N–O bond rearrangement and release of $\\text{NO}_{2}$ and $\\text{O}_{2}$, while the highly stable oxide $\\text{MgO}$ forms due to strong lattice stabilization with a small, highly charged cation. Lithium, although monovalent, is the smallest cation in Group 1; $\\text{Li}^{+}$ has an unusually high charge density compared to other alkali cations. Consequently, $\\text{Li}^{+}$ also significantly polarizes $\\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$, imparting enhanced covalent character to $\\text{LiNO}_{3}$ and promoting a decomposition pathway analogous to that of $\\text{Mg(NO}_{3})_{2}$, i.e., formation of $\\text{Li}_{2}\\text{O}$, $\\text{NO}_{2}$, and $\\text{O}_{2}$. This is the essence of the Li–Mg diagonal relationship: both ions have high polarizing power relative to their groups, and both interact with large, polarizable anions in similar ways.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\nA. This invokes high charge-to-radius ratios (high charge density) and strong polarizing power of $\\text{Li}^{+}$ and $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$, destabilizing $\\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$. This directly matches Fajans' rules and the diagonal relationship rationale and correctly accounts for the similar decomposition behavior.\nB. Electronegativity values of Li and Mg are not nearly identical, and electronegativity alone does not capture the cation-induced polarization of the anion in the solid salt as the primary factor for the decomposition pathway. This is not the best explanation.\nC. While oxide formation is thermodynamically favored for small, highly charged cations, attributing the behavior solely to standard Gibbs energies of formation and comparing specifically to nitrites is not the clearest or most general periodic explanation. The observed pattern is best rationalized by cation polarizing power and Fajans' rules; moreover, $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ nitrites are not the stable endpoint under these conditions. This is not the best answer.\nD. First ionization energies pertain to gaseous atoms and are not the controlling factor in the thermal decomposition of ionic solids. This does not address the nitrate polarization and is not explanatory here.\nE. The claim of isomorphous crystal lattices is not generally valid and, even if it were, lattice isomorphism is not the governing principle for the observed diagonal relationship and decomposition pathway.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that both $\\text{Li}^{+}$ and $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ possess high charge density and strong polarizing power, which destabilizes $\\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$ and promotes decomposition to the oxide with release of $\\text{NO}_{2}$ and $\\text{O}_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2247764"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting reaction products, diagonal relationships also help explain physical properties like solubility. This exercise explores the Li/Mg relationship in the context of carbonate solubility, which involves a delicate tug-of-war between lattice energy and hydration energy.

A chemist is tasked with predicting the relative solubility of two Group 1 carbonates, lithium carbonate ($\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$) and sodium carbonate ($\\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3$), in water at room temperature. For context, it is known that the carbonates of the Group 2 (alkaline earth) metals are sparingly soluble in water, and magnesium carbonate ($\\text{MgCO}_3$) is notably more soluble than the other carbonates in its group, such as calcium carbonate ($\\text{CaCO}_3$) and strontium carbonate ($\\text{SrCO}_3$).\n\nBased on the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium, and the principles governing ionic compound solubility, select the statement below that provides the correct prediction and the most accurate chemical reasoning for the relative solubilities of $\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$ and $\\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3$.\n\nA. $\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$ is significantly less soluble than $\\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3$. The small $\\text{Li}^+$ ion has a high charge density, similar to $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$, leading to a very high lattice energy for $\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$. This high lattice energy is not sufficiently overcome by the hydration energy of the ions, a characteristic that makes it behave more like the sparingly soluble $\\text{MgCO}_3$ than the highly soluble $\\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3$.\n\nB. $\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$ is significantly more soluble than $\\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3$. Since the diagonal relationship implies Li resembles Mg, and $\\text{MgCO}_3$ is the most soluble carbonate in Group 2, $\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$ should also exhibit exceptionally high solubility compared to other members of its own group.\n\nC. $\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$ and $\\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3$ have comparable solubilities. As they are both in Group 1, the effect of the cation ($\\text{Li}^+$ vs. $\\text{Na}^+$) is minimal compared to the properties of the large carbonate anion ($\\text{CO}_3^{2-}$), leading to similar behavior in water.\n\nD. $\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$ is significantly less soluble than $\\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3$. This is because the general, overriding trend for all alkali metal salts is a decrease in solubility down the group, making lithium compounds consistently the least soluble.\n\nE. $\\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3$ is significantly less soluble than $\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$. The diagonal relationship links Li to Mg, and the period relationship links Na to Mg.

Qualitatively, lower $\\Delta H_{\\text{latt}}$ and more exothermic $\\Delta H_{\\text{hyd}}$ favor higher solubility, while higher $\\Delta H_{\\text{latt}}$ and less exothermic $\\Delta H_{\\text{hyd}}$ oppose it.\n\nLattice enthalpy for an ionic solid scales with interionic Coulombic attraction. In the Born–Landé model,\n$$\nU \\sim \\frac{N_{\\text{A}} M z^{+} z^{-} e^{2}}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r_{0}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the Madelung constant, $z^{+}$ and $z^{-}$ are the ionic charges, $r_{0}$ is the nearest-neighbor distance, and $n$ is the Born exponent. For fixed anion $\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}$, decreasing the cation radius from $\\text{Na}^{+}$ to $\\text{Li}^{+}$ decreases $r_{0}$ and thus increases $U$ (that is, $\\Delta H_{\\text{latt}}$ is larger for $\\text{Li}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$ than for $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$).\n\nHydration enthalpy of cations becomes more exothermic as ionic radius decreases; hence $\\Delta H_{\\text{hyd}}$ for $\\text{Li}^{+}$ is more exothermic than for $\\text{Na}^{+}$. However, with a large, highly polarizable anion like $\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}$, the small, high–charge-density cation $\\text{Li}^{+}$ exhibits strong polarizing power (Fajans’ rules), increasing covalent character in $\\text{Li}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$. Increased covalency both raises effective lattice stabilization and reduces the ease of hydration of the ion pair, thus diminishing solubility relative to a more purely ionic lattice such as $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$.\n\nTherefore, although $\\text{Li}^{+}$ has a more exothermic hydration enthalpy, the increase in $\\Delta H_{\\text{latt}}$ together with enhanced covalent character for $\\text{Li}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$ means that $\\Delta H_{\\text{sol}}$ is less favorable for $\\text{Li}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$ than for $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$, leading to lower solubility for $\\text{Li}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$.\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the diagonal relationship: lithium resembles magnesium in forming less soluble carbonates and hydroxides. While $\\text{MgCO}_{3}$ is more soluble than other Group 2 carbonates such as $\\text{CaCO}_{3}$ and $\\text{SrCO}_{3}$, it is still only sparingly soluble overall. Lithium mirrors this behavior within Group 1; indeed, $\\text{Li}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$ is relatively poorly soluble compared to the highly soluble $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A correctly states that $\\text{Li}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$ is significantly less soluble than $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$ and attributes this to high lattice enthalpy due to small $\\text{Li}^{+}$ (high charge density) and its Mg-like behavior, consistent with Fajans’ rules and the diagonal relationship. While the hydration enthalpy of $\\text{Li}^{+}$ is indeed large in magnitude, the net balance still disfavors dissolution for $\\text{Li}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$ relative to $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$; the qualitative reasoning is sound.\n- Option B misapplies the diagonal relationship, inferring exceptional solubility; this contradicts the known low solubility trend for lithium and magnesium carbonates.\n- Option C neglects the strong cation-size effect and polarization differences, which are decisive for carbonates.\n- Option D asserts an “overriding trend” for all alkali salts; no single monotonic solubility trend applies across all anions, and specifically carbonates do not follow such a blanket rule.\n- Option E incorrectly links sodium to magnesium based on period alone; period similarity does not imply analogous carbonate solubility.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2247718"}, {"introduction": "Having seen its effect on reactions and physical properties, we now turn to the heart of the matter: the chemical bond itself. This practice focuses on the beryllium/aluminum diagonal pair and asks you to apply Fajans' rules to assess covalent character in their chlorides.

One such property is the nature of a chemical bond, which can span a continuum from purely ionic to purely covalent.

The relevant principle is Fajans’ rules: the covalent character in an ionic bond increases with the cation’s polarizing power and the anion’s polarizability. Since the anion is the same in all cases (chloride), differences in bonding character arise primarily from the cation.\n\nPolarizing power increases with increasing cation charge and decreasing cation radius. A useful proportionality is that the electric field at the anion due to the cation scales as $E \\propto \\frac{z}{r^{2}}$, where $z$ is the cation charge and $r$ is its ionic radius. Thus, greater $\\frac{z}{r^{2}}$ implies stronger polarization and hence greater covalent character.\n\nCompare the cations:\n- Charges: $z(Al^{3+})=3$, $z(Be^{2+})=2$, $z(Mg^{2+})=2$.\n- Radii trend within Group 2: $r(Be^{2+})<r(Mg^{2+})$. Aluminum is also small and highly charged, so $Al^{3+}$ has very large $\\frac{z}{r^{2}}$.\n- Therefore, among $Be^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$, $Be^{2+}$ has the larger $\\frac{z}{r^{2}}$ due to its much smaller radius with the same charge, so it has higher polarizing power than $Mg^{2+}$.\n\nConsequently, $BeCl_{2}$ will show greater covalent character than $MgCl_{2}$, making it more similar in bonding to $AlCl_{3}$, which is known to be substantially covalent (e.g., dimeric $Al_{2}Cl_{6}$ in the gas phase). This directly supports option A.\n\nAssessing the distractors:\n- Option B incorrectly relies on period similarity rather than polarizing power; $Mg^{2+}$ is larger and less polarizing than $Be^{2+}$, so $MgCl_{2}$ is more ionic, not more similar to $AlCl_{3}$.\n- Option C is an overgeneralization; being lighter does not universally imply more covalency.
