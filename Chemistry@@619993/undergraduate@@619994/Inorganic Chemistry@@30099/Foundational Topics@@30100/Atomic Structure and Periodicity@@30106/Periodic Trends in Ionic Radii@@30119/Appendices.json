This exercise [@problem_id:2279328] focuses on an isoelectronic series, a set of ions that share the same number of electrons. By analyzing such a series, you can effectively isolate the powerful influence of the nuclear charge ($Z$) on the ionic radius, a crucial skill for navigating periodic trends.", "problem": "A materials scientist is investigating the properties of ionic compounds formed from elements in the third and fourth periods of the periodic table. To predict the crystal lattice structure and energy, an accurate understanding of the relative sizes of the constituent ions is crucial. You are tasked with comparing the ionic radius of a sulfide ion ($S^{2-}$) and a potassium ion ($K^{+}$). The atomic number of sulfur (S) is 16, and the atomic number of potassium (K) is 19.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly compares the radii of these two ions and provides the primary reason for the difference?\n\nA. $S^{2-}$ is larger than $K^{+}$ because it has fewer protons pulling on the same number of electrons.\n\nB. $K^{+}$ is larger than $S^{2-}$ because the neutral potassium atom is in a higher period (Period 4) than the neutral sulfur atom (Period 3), meaning its valence electrons occupy a higher principal energy level.\n\nC. $S^{2-}$ is smaller than $K^{+}$ because anions are generally smaller than cations due to electron-electron repulsion.\n\nD. $K^{+}$ is larger than $S^{2-}$ because it has more protons, resulting in a larger nucleus which dictates a larger overall ionic radius.\n\nE. The ions have approximately the same size because they possess the same number of electrons, leading to identical electron cloud distributions.", "solution": "We compare the ionic radii of $S^{2-}$ and $K^{+}$ by first determining their electron counts and then applying the isoelectronic series trend governed by effective nuclear charge.\n\n1) Electron counts:\n$$N_{e}(S^{2-}) = Z(S) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18,$$\n$$N_{e}(K^{+}) = Z(K) - 1 = 19 - 1 = 18.$$\nThus, $S^{2-}$ and $K^{+}$ are isoelectronic (both have $18$ electrons).\n\n2) Effective nuclear charge and radius trend:\nFor isoelectronic species, the shielding $S$ is approximately the same, so the effective nuclear charge\n$$Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - S$$\nis larger for the species with the larger nuclear charge $Z$. A larger $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ increases the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electron cloud, pulling electrons closer and reducing the ionic radius. This qualitative dependence can be understood from Coulomb’s law for the attractive force between the nucleus and an electron cloud:\n$$F \\propto \\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}} q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}},$$\nwhere $q_{e}$ is the elementary charge and $r$ characterizes the size of the electron cloud. Larger $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ corresponds to a stronger attraction and therefore a smaller $r$.\n\n3) Applying to $S^{2-}$ and $K^{+}$:\nSince $Z(K^{+}) = 19$ and $Z(S^{2-}) = 16$, and both ions are isoelectronic, we have\n$$Z_{\\text{eff}}(K^{+}) > Z_{\\text{eff}}(S^{2-}) \\implies r(K^{+})  r(S^{2-}).$$\n\nTherefore, $S^{2-}$ is larger than $K^{+}$, and the primary reason is that $S^{2-}$ has fewer protons pulling on the same number of electrons (lower $Z_{\\text{eff}}$), leading to a larger radius.

By considering the principles of Coulomb's Law, you will see how the distance between ions is a critical factor in determining a compound's lattice energy.", "problem": "The strength of the bonding in an ionic solid is primarily determined by the electrostatic forces between its constituent ions, which can be modeled using Coulomb's Law. This strength is often quantified by the lattice energy. Consider two ionic compounds, calcium sulfide (CaS) and magnesium oxide (MgO).

Calcium sulfide (CaS) has stronger ionic bonding because the sum of its ionic radii is larger, leading to a more stable crystal lattice.\n\nB. Magnesium oxide (MgO) has stronger ionic bonding because the sum of its ionic radii is smaller, resulting in stronger electrostatic attraction between the ions.\n\nC. Both compounds have ionic bonds of approximately equal strength because the magnitude of the product of their ionic charges ($|(+2) \\times (-2)|$) is the same.\n\nD. Calcium sulfide (CaS) has stronger ionic bonding because both $Ca^{2+}$ and $S^{2-}$ are larger and therefore more polarizable, which enhances the attraction.\n\nE. Magnesium oxide (MgO) has stronger ionic bonding because the electronegativity difference between Mg and O is greater than that between Ca and S.", "solution": "Use the Coulombic model for ionic solids.
