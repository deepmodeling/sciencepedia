The general periodic trends are:\n- Across a period (left to right), electronegativity increases due to increasing effective nuclear charge with comparable shielding.\n- Down a group, electronegativity decreases due to increasing principal quantum number, larger atomic radius, and greater shielding.\n\nIdentify positions:\n- Nitrogen (N) is in period 2, group 15; it lies far to the right and high in the table, so it has a high electronegativity.\n- Magnesium (Mg) is in period 3, group 2; it is left and lower, so it has a low electronegativity.\n- Germanium (Ge) is in period 4, group 14; it is to the right of Mg (which increases electronegativity) but one period lower than Si (which decreases relative to elements above), giving it a moderate value.\n\nPairwise comparisons:\n- Comparing Mg and Ge: moving from Mg (group 2) to Ge (group 14) involves a large move to the right, which strongly increases electronegativity, while moving down one period reduces it. The across-period increase dominates over the down-group decrease for these positions, so $Ge > Mg$.\n- Comparing Ge and N: N is both higher (up a group path) and further to the right relative to Ge, and both effects increase electronegativity, so $N > Ge$.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing electronegativity is $Mg  Ge  N$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2010792"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative trends are useful, a quantitative understanding allows for more precise predictions about chemical behavior.
