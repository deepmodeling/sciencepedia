One of the most important properties is magnetism, which arises from unpaired electrons.

The interaction of ions in a stellar atmosphere with magnetic fields can lead to the splitting of spectral lines, a phenomenon whose magnitude depends on the ion's electronic structure.

By using Slater's rules to calculate the effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - \\sigma$), you will gain a deeper insight into the concepts of electron shielding and orbital energies, allowing you to rationalize why the apparently lower-energy $3d$ orbitals are not the first to be emptied during ionization.", "problem": "The electronic structure of transition metals presents an interesting case study in atomic physics.
