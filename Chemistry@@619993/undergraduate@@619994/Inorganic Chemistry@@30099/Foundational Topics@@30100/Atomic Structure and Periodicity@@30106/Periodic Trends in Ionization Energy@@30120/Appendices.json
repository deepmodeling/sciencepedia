The general periodic trend is that IE1 increases from left to right due to increasing effective nuclear charge $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and roughly constant shielding within the same principal quantum number $n=3$, which strengthens the attraction of electrons to the nucleus and raises the energy required to remove the outermost electron.\n\nHowever, two well-established exceptions occur:\n- From group 2 to group 13 (Mg to Al), IE1 decreases because the electron removed from Al is from a $3p$ subshell, which is higher in energy and more weakly held than the $3s$ electron in Mg. Thus, $\\mathrm{IE1}(\\mathrm{Al})<\\mathrm{IE1}(\\mathrm{Mg})$.\n- From group 15 to group 16 (P to S), IE1 decreases because P has a half-filled $3p^{3}$ configuration, which is relatively stable, while S has $3p^{4}$ with one paired electron in a $p$ orbital; electron-electron repulsion within the paired set lowers the energy required to remove one electron.
