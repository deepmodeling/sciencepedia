This process excites the hydrogen atoms, promoting their single electron to various higher energy levels. A spectrometer is used to analyze the light emitted as the atoms subsequently de-excite. Analysis of the spectrum reveals that the highest principal quantum number populated by the excitation process is $n=4$. Assuming that all possible electronic transitions can occur as the atoms cascade down towards the ground state ($n=1$), calculate the total number of unique spectral lines that can be emitted by the sample.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of unique spectral lines observed during the de-excitation of hydrogen atoms. A unique spectral line corresponds to a unique electronic transition between two distinct energy levels. A transition is defined by an initial principal quantum number, $n_i$, and a final principal quantum number, $n_f$, where the emission of a photon requires that $n_i > n_f$.\n\nThe highest populated energy level is given as $n=4$, and the atoms de-excite towards the ground state, $n=1$. This means that transitions can originate from any excited state up to and including $n=4$ (i.e., $n=4, 3, 2$) and can terminate at any level below the initial level. We need to count all possible unique pairs of $(n_i, n_f)$ such that $4 \\ge n_i > n_f \\ge 1$.\n\nWe can systematically enumerate all possible downward transitions:\n\nStep 1: Consider transitions originating from the highest level, $n_i = 4$.\nThe electron can jump from $n=4$ to any lower level. The possible final states are $n_f = 3, 2, 1$. This gives three distinct transitions:\n- $n=4 \\to n=3$\n- $n=4 \\to n=2$\n- $n=4 \\to n=1$\nThese correspond to 3 unique spectral lines.\n\nStep 2: Consider transitions originating from the next level, $n_i = 3$.\nThe electron can jump from $n=3$ to any lower level. The possible final states are $n_f = 2, 1$. This gives two additional distinct transitions:\n- $n=3 \\to n=2$\n- $n=3 \\to n=1$\nThese correspond to 2 unique spectral lines. These are unique and not counted in Step 1 because their initial state is different.\n\nStep 3: Consider transitions originating from the lowest excited state, $n_i = 2$.\nThe electron can jump from $n=2$ to the only available lower level, the ground state $n_f = 1$. This gives one more distinct transition:\n- $n=2 \\to n=1$\nThis corresponds to 1 unique spectral line.\n\nStep 4: Sum the number of unique lines from all possible initial states.\nThe total number of unique spectral lines is the sum of the lines identified in each step.\nTotal number of lines = (Number of lines from $n=4$) + (Number of lines from $n=3$) + (Number of lines from $n=2$)\nTotal number of lines = $3 + 2 + 1 = 6$.\n\nAlternatively, one can recognize this problem as finding the number of ways to choose two distinct energy levels from the set of possible levels $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Let the two chosen levels be $n_a$ and $n_b$. An emission line will always correspond to a transition from the higher level to the lower level. The number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of 4 is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2}$.\n$$ \\text{Number of lines} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2293806"}, {"introduction": "Each spectral line corresponds to a specific energy transition, which in turn has a precise wavelength.
