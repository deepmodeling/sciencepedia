This practice [@problem_id:2260940] presents a common scenario that requires you to look beyond simple labels and consider the multiple, and sometimes conflicting, reactive hazards of common reagents. Mastering this skill of chemical compatibility is the first line of defense in maintaining a safe laboratory environment.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with organizing a chemical storage cabinet. On a single shelf, the student finds three bottles placed next to each other: concentrated nitric acid ($HNO_3$), glacial acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$), and aniline ($C_6H_5NH_2$). Recognizing that these chemicals may have reactive incompatibilities, the student decides to segregate them. Based on the fundamental reactive hazards of these substances (oxidizers, reducers, acids, bases, combustibles), determine the most appropriate and safest storage arrangement.\n\nA. Store the two acids (nitric acid and acetic acid) together, and store the aniline separately.\nB. Store the two organic compounds (acetic acid and aniline) together, and store the inorganic nitric acid separately.\nC. Store the nitric acid and aniline together, as they are both nitrogen-containing compounds, and store the acetic acid separately.\nD. Separate each of the three chemicals from each other, placing them in different secondary containment trays or dedicated cabinets according to their specific hazard class.\nE. Leave all three chemicals on the same shelf, but ensure there is at least 12 inches of space between each bottle.", "solution": "First, identify the fundamental hazard classes of each chemical. Concentrated nitric acid is a strong inorganic acid and a powerful oxidizer; it vigorously oxidizes organic materials and can drive highly exothermic and potentially violent reactions. Glacial acetic acid is an organic acid; it is combustible and, as an organic compound, is incompatible with strong oxidizers. Aniline is an aromatic amine; it is a weak organic base and combustible, and it is also incompatible with strong oxidizers and with strong acids due to both redox/nitration hazards and acid-base neutralization.\n\nNext, analyze the incompatibilities pairwise. Nitric acid with acetic acid is an oxidizer-organic pairing; contact or co-spillage can lead to rapid oxidation, heat release, and formation of reactive species (e.g., acetyl nitrate), so they must not be stored together. Nitric acid with aniline is even more hazardous: beyond acid-base neutralization heat, aniline is readily oxidized and can undergo nitration by nitric acid; this pairing is strongly incompatible. Acetic acid with aniline is an acid-base pair and both are combustible organics; while less violent than with nitric acid, acid-base neutralization is still incompatible for storage, and they should be segregated to prevent co-spillage and avoid cross-contamination; furthermore, amines and organic acids are typically stored in separate secondary containment within flammable/combustible storage.\n\nFrom these incompatibilities, derive the appropriate storage scheme based on standard laboratory chemical compatibility guidance. Nitric acid, as an oxidizing mineral acid, should be stored in an oxidizer-compatible, dedicated secondary containment or cabinet, segregated from all organics (both acetic acid and aniline) and from bases. Glacial acetic acid, as a combustible organic acid, should be stored with organic acids or in a flammable/combustible liquids cabinet, segregated from oxidizers and from bases. Aniline, as a combustible organic base (amine), should be stored with organic bases or in a flammable/combustible cabinet, segregated from oxidizers and from acids.\n\nEvaluate the options accordingly. Option A groups nitric acid with acetic acid, which is unsafe due to oxidizer-organic incompatibility. Option B groups acetic acid with aniline, which is unsafe due to acid-base incompatibility. Option C groups nitric acid with aniline, which is highly unsafe due to oxidizer-organic and nitration hazards as well as acid-base neutralization. Option E relies on mere spacing on the same shelf, which does not provide adequate segregation or secondary containment and is not consistent with prudent practices. Option D prescribes full segregation of each according to its hazard class in separate secondary containment or dedicated cabinets, which is the correct and safest arrangement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2260940"}, {"introduction": "Safe laboratory practice extends beyond storage to the entire lifecycle of a chemical, including its disposal.
