Nitrogen contributes $5$ electrons, two oxygens contribute $2 \\times 6 = 12$ electrons, and the $+1$ charge indicates the loss of one electron. Thus, the total is $5 + 12 - 1 = 16$ electrons.\n\nPlace nitrogen as the central atom: O–N–O. To satisfy octets with $16$ electrons and minimize formal charges, use two double bonds, giving O=N=O.

The true extent of hybridization is a delicate balance, strongly influenced by the energy difference between the valence $s$ and $p$ orbitals. This final practice [@problem_id:2297818] delves into this more nuanced aspect of Valence Bond Theory, encouraging you to use orbital energetics to explain why bond angles can deviate significantly from idealized values, particularly when comparing elements down a group.", "problem": "In inorganic chemistry, it is observed that the H–N–H bond angle in ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) is $107.8^\\circ$, while the H–P–H bond angle in phosphine ($\\text{PH}_3$) is significantly smaller at $93.5^\\circ$. Both molecules have a trigonal pyramidal geometry according to Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, which alone does not adequately account for this substantial difference.\n\nUsing the principles of valence bond theory, specifically concerning the relationship between electronegativity, orbital energies, and the extent of hybridization, select the statement that provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why the bond angle in phosphine is much closer to $90^\\circ$ than the bond angle in ammonia.\n\nA. The energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals is larger for phosphorus than for nitrogen. This disfavors s-p hybridization, causing the P-H bonds to utilize orbitals with higher p-character, resulting in a bond angle closer to the $90^\\circ$ angle between unhybridized p-orbitals.\n\nB. The lone pair on the phosphorus atom in phosphine is larger and more diffuse than the lone pair on the nitrogen atom in ammonia, causing greater lone pair-bond pair repulsion that compresses the H-P-H angle more significantly.\n\nC. The larger atomic radius of phosphorus compared to nitrogen leads to greater steric repulsion between the hydrogen atoms in phosphine, which forces the H-P-H bond angle to be smaller.\n\nD. The energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals is smaller for phosphorus than for nitrogen, which makes the central atom more willing to hybridize. This leads to the lone pair occupying a pure s-orbital to maximize stability, forcing the bonding orbitals to be pure p-orbitals.\n\nE. Nitrogen is more electronegative than phosphorus, which causes it to withdraw more electron density from the hydrogen atoms. This increased electron density in the N-H bonds leads to stronger bond pair-bond pair repulsions, widening the angle from $90^\\circ$ to $107.8^\\circ$.", "solution": "In valence bond theory, a directed bonding hybrid on the central atom is written as a linear combination of the central-atom atomic orbitals. For a bond oriented along a given axis, an $s$ orbital and the appropriately oriented $p$ orbital mix to form a hybrid\n$$\nh = c_{s}\\,s + c_{p}\\,p,\n$$\nwith $|c_{s}|^{2} + |c_{p}|^{2} = 1$. The extent of $s$–$p$ mixing follows the standard two-level mixing result from perturbation theory: the mixing coefficient is inversely proportional to the energy gap between the interacting levels. If $E_{s}$ and $E_{p}$ are the orbital energies and $H_{sp}$ is the interaction matrix element, then the $s$-admixture into a $p$-like function scales as\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{c_{s}}{c_{p}}\\right| \\propto \\frac{|H_{sp}|}{\\Delta E_{sp}}, \n\\quad \\Delta E_{sp} \\equiv |E_{p} - E_{s}|.\n$$\nThus, a larger $s$–$p$ energy separation $\\Delta E_{sp}$ reduces $s$–$p$ hybridization, yielding bonding hybrids with higher $p$-character (smaller $|c_{s}|$, larger $|c_{p}|$).\n\nThe bond angle set by a family of equivalent hybrids is governed by their $s$- versus $p$-character. Defining the usual $sp^{n}$ index by\n$$\nn \\equiv \\frac{f_{p}}{f_{s}} = \\frac{|c_{p}|^{2}}{|c_{s}|^{2}},\n$$\nthe angle $\\theta$ between two equivalent hybrids satisfies the standard relation\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = -\\frac{1}{n}.\n$$\nThis reproduces the limiting cases: $n=3$ gives $\\theta=109.47^{\\circ}$ (tetrahedral, $sp^{3}$), $n=2$ gives $\\theta=120^{\\circ}$ ($sp^{2}$), $n=1$ gives $\\theta=180^{\\circ}$ ($sp$), and $n\\to\\infty$ (pure $p$) gives $\\theta\\to 90^{\\circ}$. Therefore, as the $p$-character of the bonding hybrids increases (larger $n$), the bond angle approaches $90^{\\circ}$.\n\nApplying this to $\\text{NH}_{3}$ versus $\\text{PH}_{3}$, the $2s$–$2p$ gap in nitrogen is relatively small, promoting significant $s$–$p$ hybridization and hence bonding hybrids with appreciable $s$-character; the H–N–H angle therefore lies well above $90^{\\circ}$, near the tetrahedral value but slightly compressed by the lone pair. In phosphorus, the $3s$–$3p$ gap is larger, which disfavors $s$–$p$ hybridization. As a result, the P–H bonds draw from orbitals with much higher $p$-character (larger $n$), pushing the H–P–H angle toward $90^{\\circ}$. Consistently, the lone pair on phosphorus resides predominantly in the lower-energy $3s$-like orbital, which is relatively nonbonding and less repulsive than a strongly hybridized lone pair; this removes any tendency to widen the bond angle and reinforces the approach to the pure $p$ limit.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly identifies the larger $s$–$p$ energy gap in phosphorus as the cause of reduced hybridization, higher $p$-character in P–H bonding orbitals, and hence a bond angle closer to $90^{\\circ}$.\n- B is incorrect: a more diffuse lone pair on phosphorus is less, not more, strongly repulsive; moreover, the dominant effect is reduced hybridization, not enhanced repulsion.\n- C is incorrect: greater steric size would, if anything, favor larger angles to reduce H–H crowding; hydrogen size is the same in both molecules.\n- D misstates the trend: it is a larger, not smaller, $s$–$p$ gap in phosphorus that reduces hybridization; while the lone pair being largely $s$-like in $\\text{PH}_{3}$ is true, the stated reason is wrong.\n- E invokes electronegativity in a way that does not fundamentally control the central-atom hybridization that sets the angle; the decisive factor is the $s$–$p$ energy separation and the consequent hybridization extent.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2297818"}]}
