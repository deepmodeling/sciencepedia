The true structure, known as the resonance hybrid, is an average of the contributing valid resonance structures. This model often leads to the observation of fractional bond orders between atoms, indicating that the bonding is intermediate between single, double, or triple bonds.\n\nConsider the sulfite ion, which has the chemical formula $SO_3^{2-}$. By analyzing its valid resonance structures that minimize formal charges, determine the average bond order of a single sulfur-oxygen (S-O) bond within the ion.\n\nExpress your answer as an exact fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "We identify the valid resonance structures of the sulfite ion $SO_{3}^{2-}$ that minimize formal charges. The principle used is that the resonance hybrid is the average of equivalent contributing structures with minimized formal charges.\n\nFirst, count valence electrons to confirm a consistent Lewis framework. Sulfur contributes $6$, each oxygen contributes $6$ for three oxygens giving $18$, and the $2-$ charge adds $2$. Thus the total is $6 + 18 + 2 = 26$ valence electrons.\n\nA Lewis structure with all single S–O bonds places three lone pairs on each oxygen and one lone pair on sulfur. Formal charges in that all-single-bond structure are computed using the formula\n$$\n\\text{FC} = \\text{valence} - \\left(\\text{nonbonding} + \\frac{1}{2}\\times \\text{bonding electrons}\\right).\n$$\nFor each singly bonded oxygen: $6 - (6 + 1) = -1$. For sulfur with three single bonds and one lone pair: $6 - (2 + 3) = +1$. This gives $+1 + 3(-1) = -2$ overall but does not minimize formal charges on the central atom.\n\nTo minimize formal charges, form one S=O double bond by converting a lone pair on one oxygen into a bonding pair with sulfur. Then sulfur has one lone pair, two single bonds, and one double bond. The formal charges become: for sulfur, $6 - (2 + 4) = 0$; for the double-bonded oxygen, $6 - (4 + 2) = 0$; and for each singly bonded oxygen, $6 - (6 + 1) = -1$. This distribution minimizes the magnitude of formal charges on sulfur while maintaining the overall $2-$ charge.\n\nThere are three equivalent resonance structures, each with one S=O double bond and two S–O single bonds, differing only in which oxygen bears the double bond. By the resonance principle, the bond order of any particular S–O bond in the resonance hybrid equals the average of its bond orders across these structures. For a given S–O link, it is a double bond in one structure and a single bond in the other two, so its average bond order is\n$$\n\\frac{2 + 1 + 1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}.\n$$\nEquivalently, the total bond order sum in any one resonance form is $2 + 1 + 1 = 4$.
