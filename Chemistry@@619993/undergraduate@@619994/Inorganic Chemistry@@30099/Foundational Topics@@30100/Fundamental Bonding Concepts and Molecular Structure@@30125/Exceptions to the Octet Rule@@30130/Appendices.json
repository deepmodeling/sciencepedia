The central arsenic atom has a formal charge of 0 and is surrounded by 10 valence electrons.\n\nB.

The central iodine atom has two lone pairs of electrons.", "solution": "We determine the electronic and molecular structure using Lewis structures, formal charges, and VSEPR theory.\n\nFirst, count total valence electrons. Each iodine has $7$ valence electrons and the ion carries a $-1$ charge, so\n$$\nN_{\\text{val}}=3\\times 7+1=22 \\text{ electrons}.\n$$\nChoose the linear skeleton $I{-}I{-}I$ with the central iodine as the connectivity center. Place two single $I{-}I$ bonds, using $4$ electrons, leaving $22-4=18$ electrons. Complete octets on the two terminal iodines by adding three lone pairs to each terminal iodine (using $12$ electrons), leaving $18-12=6$ electrons. Place the remaining $6$ electrons as three lone pairs on the central iodine. This structure has two single bonds and three lone pairs on the central atom.\n\nCompute formal charges using\n$$\nq_{\\text{FC}}=V-(N+\\tfrac{B}{2}),\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of valence electrons of the free atom, $N$ is the number of nonbonding (lone-pair) electrons on the atom, and $B$ is the number of bonding electrons associated with that atom.\n\nFor the central iodine: $V=7$, $N=6$, $B=4$ (two single bonds), hence\n$$\nq_{\\text{central}}=7-(6+2)=-1.\n$$\nFor each terminal iodine: $V=7$, $N=6$, $B=2$ (one single bond), hence\n$$\nq_{\\text{terminal}}=7-(6+1)=0.\n$$\nThus, in the most stable Lewis resonance form (the one with minimal formal charge magnitudes and no unnecessary charge separation), the central iodine bears a formal charge of $-1$ and each terminal iodine is neutral. Any alternative with a double bond introduces less favorable charge separation (for example, $+1$ and $-2$), so the above is the preferred resonance form.\n\nApply VSEPR theory. The central iodine has two bonding domains and three lone-pair domains, so the steric number is\n$$\nS=2+3=5,\n$$\nwhich corresponds to a trigonal bipyramidal electron-domain geometry. With three lone pairs, VSEPR places the lone pairs in equatorial positions to minimize repulsions, leaving the two bonding pairs in axial positions, giving a linear molecular geometry. The central iodine has $10$ electrons around it (two bonds plus three lone pairs), so it is hypervalent and does not satisfy the octet rule.\n\nEvaluate the statements:\n- A is incorrect: formal charge is not $0$ on the central iodine, and fractional formal charges are not assigned; the most stable Lewis form has the central iodine at $-1$ and terminals at $0$.\n- B is incorrect: the molecular geometry is linear, not trigonal planar.\n- C is incorrect: the central iodine has $10$ electrons, not $8$.\n- D is correct: the electron-domain geometry around the central iodine is trigonal bipyramidal.\n- E is incorrect: the central iodine has three lone pairs, not two.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2251211"}]}
