Tetrahedral\n\nC. Trigonal planar\n\nD. T-shaped\n\nE. Bent", "solution": "Consider the Lewis structure of thionyl chloride, $SOCl_2$. The central atom is sulfur. Count valence electrons to determine the likely bonding and lone-pair arrangement. Sulfur contributes $6$ valence electrons, oxygen contributes $6$, and each chlorine contributes $7$, giving a total of $6+6+2\\times 7=26$ valence electrons for the molecule.\n\nA structure that satisfies octets and minimizes formal charges places sulfur at the center with a double bond to oxygen and single bonds to two chlorine atoms, leaving one lone pair on sulfur. Formal charges confirm this:\n- On sulfur: $\\text{FC}(S)=6-\\left(2+\\frac{8}{2}\\right)=6-(2+4)=0$,\n- On oxygen: $\\text{FC}(O)=6-\\left(4+\\frac{4}{2}\\right)=6-(4+2)=0$,\n- On each chlorine: $\\text{FC}(Cl)=7-\\left(6+\\frac{2}{2}\\right)=7-(6+1)=0$.\n\nThus, around the central sulfur, there are four regions of electron density: one $S=O$ double bond, two $S-Cl$ single bonds, and one lone pair. By VSEPR theory, four electron domains correspond to a tetrahedral electron-domain geometry.\n\nThe molecular geometry (the arrangement of atoms, ignoring lone pairs) for an $AX_3E_1$ system is trigonal pyramidal. Although bond angles deviate from the ideal tetrahedral value due to the lone pair and the $S=O$ double bond, the correct geometry classification remains trigonal pyramidal.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the molecular geometry of $SOCl_2$ is trigonal pyramidal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2298020"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting a single structure, VSEPR theory provides powerful insights into trends across related series of molecules.

The repulsion strengths satisfy:\n**Lone Pair-Lone Pair > Lone Pair-Bonding Pair > Bonding Pair-Bonding Pair**\nso the presence of lone pairs compresses bond angles relative to the ideal tetrahedral angle.\n\n- In $NH_4^+$, nitrogen has four bonding pairs and zero lone pairs ($AX_4$), giving a tetrahedral geometry with only bond pair-bond pair repulsions. This yields the largest H-N-H bond angle among the three.\n- In $NH_3$, nitrogen has three bonding pairs and one lone pair ($AX_3E_1$), giving a trigonal pyramidal geometry. Lone pair-bond pair repulsion compresses the H-N-H bond angle relative to $NH_4^+$.\n- In $NH_2^-$, nitrogen has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs ($AX_2E_2$), giving a bent geometry. Lone pair-lone pair and lone pair-bond pair repulsions compress the H-N-H bond angle even more, making it the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing H-N-H bond angle is\n$NH_2^-  NH_3  NH_4^+$,\nwhich corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2027500"}, {"introduction": "A true test of mastery involves applying a theory in reverse to solve a puzzle.
