Tetrahedral", "solution": "To determine the molecular geometry of thiophosgene ($CSCl_2$), we first need to deduce its Lewis structure and then apply the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of valence electrons.**\nThe problem states that carbon is in Group 14, sulfur in Group 16, and chlorine in Group 17. The number of valence electrons for an element in these groups corresponds to the last digit of the group number.\n- Carbon (C): 1 atom $\\times$ 4 valence electrons/atom = 4 valence electrons\n- Sulfur (S): 1 atom $\\times$ 6 valence electrons/atom = 6 valence electrons\n- Chlorine (Cl): 2 atoms $\\times$ 7 valence electrons/atom = 14 valence electrons\n- Total valence electrons = $4 + 6 + 14 = 24$ electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the central atom and draw the skeletal structure.**\nCarbon is the least electronegative atom (besides hydrogen, which is not present) and is typically the central atom in such compounds. We connect the central carbon atom to the sulfur and two chlorine atoms with single bonds.\nThis uses $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons. $24 - 6 = 18$ electrons remain.\n\n**Step 3: Complete the octets of the terminal atoms.**\nWe distribute the remaining 18 electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms (S and Cl). Each terminal atom requires 6 more electrons to complete its octet.\n- Each Cl atom gets 3 lone pairs (6 electrons). $2 \\times 6 = 12$ electrons used.\n- The S atom gets 3 lone pairs (6 electrons). $1 \\times 6 = 6$ electrons used.\n- Total electrons distributed = $12 + 6 = 18$. This uses all remaining electrons.\n\n**Step 4: Check the octet of the central atom and use formal charges to find the best Lewis structure.**\nAt this point, the central carbon atom only has 6 electrons (from the three single bonds), so its octet is incomplete. To satisfy carbon's octet, we must form a double bond by moving a lone pair from one of the terminal atoms to form a C=X bond. We have two possibilities: forming a double bond with a chlorine atom or with the sulfur atom. We can decide the most stable structure by minimizing formal charges. The formal charge (FC) is calculated as:\n$FC = (\\text{Valence e}^- ) - (\\text{Non-bonding e}^- ) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Bonding e}^-)$\n\n*Possibility 1: C=Cl double bond.*\nThe structure would be S-C(=Cl)-Cl.\n- FC on C: $4 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 0$\n- FC on S (single bond): $6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$\n- FC on Cl (double bond): $7 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = +1$\n- FC on Cl (single bond): $7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\nThis structure has a separation of formal charges (+1 and -1), which is generally unfavorable, especially placing a positive charge on the highly electronegative chlorine atom.\n\n*Possibility 2: C=S double bond.*\nThe structure would be Cl-C(=S)-Cl.\n- FC on C: $4 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 0$\n- FC on S (double bond): $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\n- FC on each Cl (single bond): $7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\nThis structure results in zero formal charge for all atoms. This is the most stable and therefore the correct Lewis structure. The structure has a central carbon atom with a double bond to sulfur and single bonds to two chlorine atoms. The central carbon has no lone pairs.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the VSEPR model.**\nThe VSEPR model predicts geometry based on the number of electron domains (regions of high electron density) around the central atom. A single bond, double bond, triple bond, or a lone pair each counts as one electron domain.\n- Around the central carbon atom, there is one C=S double bond (1 domain).\n- There are two C-Cl single bonds (2 domains).\n- Total electron domains = $1 + 2 = 3$.\n- There are no lone pairs on the central carbon atom.\n\nThe VSEPR notation for this molecule is AX$_3$, where A is the central atom, X represents a bonded atom, and the subscript 3 indicates the number of electron domains.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the molecular geometry.**\nFor a central atom with 3 electron domains and no lone pairs (AX$_3$), the domains arrange themselves in a trigonal planar electron geometry to maximize separation, with ideal bond angles of 120Â°. Since all domains are bonding pairs, the molecular geometry (the arrangement of the atoms) is the same as the electron geometry.\n\nTherefore, the molecular geometry of thiophosgene ($CSCl_2$) is trigonal planar.

Analyzing this structural change will deepen your understanding of how lone pair repulsion compresses bond angles, causing deviations from ideal geometries.", "problem": "In industrial synthesis, phosphorus trichloride ($PCl_3$) serves as a crucial precursor for many organophosphorus compounds, such as phosphites and phosphonates. Under specific conditions involving a reaction with chlorine gas and a potent Lewis acid, $PCl_3$ can be converted into the tetrachlorophosphonium cation, $PCl_4^+$. This transformation significantly alters the three-dimensional arrangement of the chlorine atoms around the central phosphorus atom.\n\nBased on fundamental principles of molecular structure, which of the following statements best describes the change in the ideal $Cl-P-Cl$ bond angle as a molecule of $PCl_3$ is converted to a $PCl_4^+$ cation?\n\nA. The bond angle increases from approximately $107^\\circ$ to $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nB. The bond angle decreases from approximately $120^\\circ$ to $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nC.

The bond angle remains essentially unchanged at approximately $109.5^\\circ$.", "solution": "To determine the change in the $Cl-P-Cl$ bond angle, we must predict the molecular geometry of both phosphorus trichloride ($PCl_3$) and the tetrachlorophosphonium cation ($PCl_4^+$) using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the geometry and bond angle of $PCl_3$.**\nFirst, we find the number of valence electrons to draw the Lewis structure. Phosphorus (P) is in Group 15, so it has 5 valence electrons. Chlorine (Cl) is in Group 17, so it has 7 valence electrons.\nTotal valence electrons in $PCl_3 = 5 + 3 \\times 7 = 5 + 21 = 26$.\n\nNext, we draw the Lewis structure. Phosphorus is the central atom, as it is less electronegative than chlorine. We connect the three Cl atoms to the central P atom with single bonds. This uses $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons.\nWe then distribute the remaining electrons to satisfy the octet rule for the terminal atoms. Each Cl atom needs 6 more electrons to complete its octet. For three Cl atoms, this requires $3 \\times 6 = 18$ electrons.\nThe total electrons used so far are $6 + 18 = 24$.\nThe number of remaining electrons is $26 - 24 = 2$. These two electrons are placed on the central phosphorus atom as a lone pair.\nThe final Lewis structure shows the phosphorus atom bonded to three chlorine atoms and having one lone pair of electrons.\n\nNow, we apply VSEPR theory. The central P atom has a total of four electron domains: three bonding pairs (from the P-Cl bonds) and one lone pair. The VSEPR notation is $AX_3E_1$, where A is the central atom, X is a bonded atom, and E is a lone pair.\nThe arrangement of four electron domains results in a tetrahedral electron geometry. However, the molecular geometry, which describes the arrangement of only the atoms, is trigonal pyramidal.\nIn an ideal tetrahedral geometry (like in $CH_4$), all bond angles are $109.5^\\circ$. According to VSEPR theory, a lone pair occupies more space and exerts greater repulsive forces than a bonding pair. This increased repulsion from the lone pair on the phosphorus atom compresses the $Cl-P-Cl$ bond angles, making them smaller than the ideal $109.5^\\circ$. The angle is typically reduced by about $2.5^\\circ$ for each lone pair, so we predict an angle of approximately $109.5^\\circ - 2.5^\\circ = 107^\\circ$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the geometry and bond angle of $PCl_4^+$.**\nFirst, we find the number of valence electrons.\nTotal valence electrons = (5 from P) + (4 $\\times$ 7 from Cl) - (1 for the +1 charge) $= 5 + 28 - 1 = 32$.\n\nNext, we draw the Lewis structure. Phosphorus is the central atom, bonded to four chlorine atoms. This uses $4 \\times 2 = 8$ electrons.\nWe distribute the remaining electrons to the terminal Cl atoms. Each of the four Cl atoms needs 6 electrons to complete its octet, for a total of $4 \\times 6 = 24$ electrons.\nThe total electrons used are $8 + 24 = 32$. There are no remaining electrons to place on the central P atom.\nThe Lewis structure shows the phosphorus atom bonded to four chlorine atoms with no lone pairs. The formal charge on P is $5 - (1/2 \\times 8) = +1$, consistent with the cation's charge.\n\nNow, we apply VSEPR theory. The central P atom has a total of four electron domains, all of which are bonding pairs. The VSEPR notation is $AX_4$.\nThe arrangement of four electron domains with no lone pairs results in both a tetrahedral electron geometry and a tetrahedral molecular geometry.\nIn this symmetrical arrangement, the repulsion between all electron pairs is equal. Therefore, the $Cl-P-Cl$ bond angles are all equal to the ideal tetrahedral angle of $109.5^\\circ$.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the bond angles and choose the correct option.**\nThe $Cl-P-Cl$ bond angle in $PCl_3$ is predicted to be approximately $107^\\circ$ due to the presence of a lone pair.\nThe $Cl-P-Cl$ bond angle in $PCl_4^+$ is predicted to be exactly $109.5^\\circ$ due to the absence of lone pairs on the central atom.\nTherefore, during the conversion of $PCl_3$ to $PCl_4^+$, the bond angle increases from approximately $107^\\circ$ to $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nThis matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2283643"}, {"introduction": "A molecule's geometry is not merely an abstract feature; it directly dictates crucial physical properties like polarity.
