This first exercise challenges us to apply these principles by comparing two simple hydrides, silane ($SiH_4$) and phosphine ($PH_3$). By carefully considering factors like molecular geometry, polarity, and the strict requirements for hydrogen bonding, we can build a clear and reasoned prediction, reinforcing our understanding of the hierarchy of forces that govern a substance's state of matter [@problem_id:2259216].", "problem": "In inorganic chemistry, the nature of intermolecular forces is crucial for predicting the physical properties of molecular compounds. Consider the simple hydrides silane ($SiH_4$) and phosphine ($PH_3$). You are provided with the following data:\n\n- Pauling electronegativity of Silicon (Si): 1.90\n- Pauling electronegativity of Phosphorus (P): 2.19\n- Pauling electronegativity of Hydrogen (H): 2.20\n- Molar mass of $SiH_4$: 32.12 g/mol\n- Molar mass of $PH_3$: 34.00 g/mol\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the potential intermolecular forces for both molecules, predict their relative boiling points and select the option that provides the correct prediction and justification.\n\nA. Phosphine ($PH_3$) has a significantly higher boiling point than silane ($SiH_4$) because the phosphorus atom is electronegative enough to form strong hydrogen bonds.\n\nB. Silane ($SiH_4$) has a higher boiling point than phosphine ($PH_3$) because its symmetric tetrahedral structure allows for more effective London dispersion forces than the trigonal pyramidal phosphine.\n\nC. Phosphine ($PH_3$) has a higher boiling point than silane ($SiH_4$) because phosphine is a polar molecule exhibiting dipole-dipole interactions, whereas silane is nonpolar and only has London dispersion forces.\n\nD. Silane ($SiH_4$) and phosphine ($PH_3$) have nearly identical boiling points because their molar masses are very similar, leading to comparable London dispersion forces, and neither molecule can form hydrogen bonds.\n\nE. Silane ($SiH_4$) has a higher boiling point than phosphine ($PH_3$) because the Si-H bond is more polar than the P-H bond, leading to stronger overall intermolecular attractions.", "solution": "Intermolecular forces that can govern boiling points are, in increasing typical strength: London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding requires hydrogen bonded to a strongly electronegative, small atom (typically N, O, or F) with a lone pair on a neighboring molecule to accept the hydrogen bond. Phosphorus and silicon do not meet this requirement, so neither $PH_{3}$ nor $SiH_{4}$ can form classical hydrogen bonds.\n\nAssess bond polarity via electronegativity. Let $\\chi(X)$ denote the Pauling electronegativity of element $X$. The data imply $\\chi(P) \\approx \\chi(H)$, so the $P-H$ bond dipole is very small. Also $\\chi(H) > \\chi(Si)$, so the $Si-H$ bond is polarized toward hydrogen. However, the molecular geometry determines whether bond dipoles cancel.\n\nFor $SiH_{4}$, the geometry is tetrahedral with four identical $Si-H$ bonds. By symmetry, the vector sum of the bond dipoles cancels, giving a nonpolar molecule with net dipole moment $\\mu \\approx 0$. Therefore, $SiH_{4}$ exhibits only London dispersion forces.\n\nFor $PH_{3}$, the geometry is trigonal pyramidal due to the lone pair on phosphorus (VSEPR). Even though each $P-H$ bond has very small polarity, the asymmetric pyramidal geometry and lone pair produce a small but nonzero molecular dipole moment $\\mu > 0$. Consequently, $PH_{3}$ exhibits dipole-dipole interactions in addition to London dispersion forces.\n\nCompare dispersion contributions. The molar masses $M(SiH_{4})$ and $M(PH_{3})$ are similar, so their London dispersion strengths are comparable; if anything, $PH_{3}$ is slightly heavier and has a lone pair-bearing, larger central atom, which can modestly increase polarizability and dispersion. The decisive difference is that $PH_{3}$ has dipole-dipole interactions while $SiH_{4}$ does not.\n\nTherefore, $PH_{3}$ should have the higher boiling point because it experiences both London dispersion and dipole-dipole interactions, whereas $SiH_{4}$ has only London dispersion. Evaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: neither molecule hydrogen-bonds.\n- B is incorrect in both order and justification; $SiH_{4}$ does not gain stronger dispersion from symmetry, and it actually boils lower.\n- C is correct: $PH_{3}$ is (weakly) polar and has dipole-dipole interactions; $SiH_{4}$ is nonpolar and has only dispersion.\n- D is incorrect: similar masses do not make boiling points nearly identical when one species has dipole-dipole interactions.\n- E is incorrect: while $Si-H$ bonds are more polar than $P-H$ bonds, $SiH_{4}$ is overall nonpolar, so increased bond polarity does not translate into stronger intermolecular attractions.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2259216"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify hydrogen bonds, the next step is to evaluate their relative strengths. This practice moves beyond simple identification to a more nuanced analysis of the factors that make a good hydrogen bond acceptor [@problem_id:2259246]. We will consider a fixed hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen fluoride ($HF$), and compare the strength of the interaction it forms with three different acceptors: ammonia ($NH_3$), water ($H_2O$), and another $HF$ molecule.
