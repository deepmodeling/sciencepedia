Moving beyond the familiar context of water, this problem challenges you to apply the solvent system definition, where the solvent's autoionization sets the rules for what constitutes an acid or a base. By analyzing a simple salt in liquid ammonia, you will practice identifying the characteristic acidic and basic ions of a non-aqueous system to predict the nature of the resulting solution [@problem_id:2239049].", "problem": "In the study of non-aqueous solvents, the definition of an acid and a base is generalized based on the autoionization of the solvent itself. Consider liquid ammonia ($NH_3$) as a solvent, which undergoes autoionization according to the following equilibrium:\n$$\n2NH_3(l) \\rightleftharpoons NH_4^+(am) + NH_2^-(am)\n$$\nHere, `(am)` denotes a species solvated by ammonia. According to the solvent system definition, an acid is any substance that increases the concentration of the characteristic cation of thesolvent (the solvonium ion), and a base is any substance that increases the concentration of the characteristic anion of the solvent (the solvate ion).\n\nA chemist dissolves a sample of ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$) in pure liquid ammonia.

Basic, because ammonia is fundamentally a basic molecule.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the acidic or basic nature of an ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$) solution in liquid ammonia ($NH_3$). We must use the solvent system definition of acids and bases.\n\nFirst, let's identify the characteristic acidic and basic species in the liquid ammonia solvent system. The autoionization equilibrium is given as:\n$$\n2NH_3(l) \\rightleftharpoons NH_4^+(am) + NH_2^-(am)\n$$\nAccording to the solvent system definition:\n- The characteristic cation (solvonium ion) is the ammonium ion, $NH_4^+$. Any substance that increases the concentration of $NH_4^+$ in liquid ammonia is an acid.\n- The characteristic anion (solvate ion) is the amide ion, $NH_2^-$. Any substance that increases the concentration of $NH_2^-$ in liquid ammonia is a base.\n\nNext, we analyze the behavior of the solute, ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$), when dissolved in liquid ammonia. Liquid ammonia is a polar solvent, and $NH_4Cl$ is an ionic salt. Therefore, it will dissociate into its constituent ions upon dissolution:\n$$\nNH_4Cl(s) \\xrightarrow{\\text{liquid } NH_3} NH_4^+(am) + Cl^-(am)\n$$\nThis dissociation directly introduces ammonium ions, $NH_4^+$, into the solution.\n\nBy adding $NH_4Cl$, we are increasing the concentration of the $NH_4^+$ ion. Since $NH_4^+$ is the characteristic cation (solvonium ion) of the liquid ammonia solvent, increasing its concentration makes the solution acidic.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n- **A. Acidic, because $NH_4Cl$ increases the concentration of the characteristic cation of the solvent.** This aligns with our analysis. The dissolution of $NH_4Cl$ directly increases $[NH_4^+]$, which is the acidic species in this solvent system. This is the correct answer.\n- **B. Basic, because the chloride ion ($Cl^-$) is the conjugate base of a strong acid and will react with the solvent.** The chloride ion a is the conjugate base of hydrogen chloride ($HCl$). In liquid ammonia, $HCl$ is a very strong acid, which means $Cl^-$ is an exceptionally weak base. Its contribution to the overall basicity is negligible, especially compared to the direct addition of the strong acid $NH_4^+$. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n- **C. Neutral, because $NH_4Cl$ is a salt and salts are always neutral.** This is a common misconception based on a simplistic view from aqueous chemistry (e.g., $NaCl$ in water). The acidic or basic nature of a salt solution depends entirely on how its ions interact with the specific solvent. This statement is incorrect.\n- **D. Amphoteric, because the ammonium ion can act as an acid and the chloride ion can act as a base.** While $NH_4^+$ is indeed the acid, the basic character of $Cl^-$ is negligible in this solvent. The dominant effect is the significant increase in the concentration of the acidic species, $NH_4^+$. Therefore, the solution is distinctly acidic, not amphoteric.\n- **E. Basic, because ammonia is fundamentally a basic molecule.** This reasoning is flawed. While ammonia acts as a weak base in water, here it is the solvent itself. The acidity or basicity of the *solution* is determined by the relative concentrations of the solvent's characteristic ions, $NH_4^+$ and $NH_2^-$, not by the properties of the solvent molecule in another context.\n\nBased on this step-by-step reasoning, the dissolution of $NH_4Cl$ in liquid ammonia results in an acidic solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2239049"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of solvent-defined properties, we now turn to a key function of solvents: dissolving solutes. This exercise moves beyond the simple \"like dissolves like\" mantra to a more nuanced prediction of solubility for an ionic salt by comparing a polar, coordinating solvent with a nonpolar one. This practice is crucial for understanding how specific intermolecular forces, such as ion-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, govern the energetics of the dissolution process [@problem_id:2239117].", "problem": "A chemist is working in a specialized laboratory where non-aqueous solvent chemistry is explored. The task is to dissolve a sample of potassium chloride ($KCl$), a typical ionic salt. Two non-aqueous solvents are available: liquid ammonia ($NH_3$) and benzene ($C_6H_6$). Based on the fundamental principles of solubility and solvent properties, predict in which of these two solvents potassium chloride will be significantly more soluble and select the correct reasoning for your prediction.\n\nA. Benzene, because as a nonpolar molecule, it will not interact strongly with the ions, allowing the salt's crystal lattice to break apart easily.\n\nB. Liquid ammonia, because it can form strong hydrogen bonds with both the potassium cations and the chloride anions.\n\nC. Benzene, because the delocalized pi-electron system of the benzene ring can effectively stabilize the charged potassium and chloride ions.\n\nD. Liquid ammonia, because it is a polar, coordinating solvent that can effectively solvate both the $K^{+}$ cation and the $Cl^{-}$ anion, overcoming the lattice energy of the salt.\n\nE. Neither solvent will be effective, as only highly polar protic solvents like water can dissolve ionic compounds like KCl.", "solution": "To predict solubility of an ionic solid such as $KCl$ in a given solvent, compare the free energy change of solution,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{soln}}=\\Delta H_{\\text{soln}}-T\\Delta S_{\\text{soln}},\n$$\nand require $\\Delta G_{\\text{soln}}<0$ for significant solubility.

A solvent that provides large-magnitude (more exothermic) $\\Delta H_{\\text{solv}}$ for both ions can overcome $U_{\\text{lattice}}$.\n\nA principal descriptor is the dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_{r}$, which controls electrostatic stabilization of ions. In the Born model, the free energy of solvation of an ion of charge $z$ and radius $r$ is\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\text{Born}}=-\\frac{N_{A} z^{2} e^{2}}{8\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{r}}\\right),\n$$\nshowing that larger $\\varepsilon_{r}$ yields more negative (stabilizing) solvation free energy. Liquid ammonia is a polar solvent with substantially larger $\\varepsilon_{r}$ than benzene, which is nonpolar with very small $\\varepsilon_{r}$. Therefore, the Coulombic component of ion solvation is much stronger in liquid ammonia than in benzene.\n\nBeyond bulk polarity, specific interactions matter. Liquid ammonia is a Lewis-basic, coordinating solvent: the nitrogen lone pair donates to $K^{+}$ (ion–dipole coordination), and its N–H bonds can hydrogen-bond to $Cl^{-}$. Thus ammonia can effectively solvate both $K^{+}$ and $Cl^{-}$. By contrast, benzene is nonpolar, has negligible donor ability, and lacks hydrogen-bond donating capacity; it cannot meaningfully solvate $Cl^{-}$ and provides only weak cation–$\\pi$ interactions for $K^{+}$, which are insufficient to compensate the lattice energy of $KCl$.\n\nEvaluating the options in light of these principles:\n- A is incorrect: weak solvent–ion interactions do not help the crystal lattice break; strong solvation is required to offset $U_{\\text{lattice}}$.\n- B is incorrect in its mechanism: while ammonia can hydrogen-bond to $Cl^{-}$, $K^{+}$ is stabilized by Lewis base coordination (ion–dipole), not by hydrogen bonding.\n- C is incorrect: benzene’s $\\pi$ system does not provide effective bulk stabilization of both ions, especially the anion, in a low-$\\varepsilon_{r}$ medium.\n- D is correct: liquid ammonia is a polar, coordinating solvent that solvates both ions well enough to overcome lattice energy.\n- E is incorrect: many ionic salts are soluble in polar nonaqueous solvents; water is not uniquely capable.\n\nTherefore, potassium chloride will be significantly more soluble in liquid ammonia for the stated reason.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2239117"}, {"introduction": "Solvents do more than just dissolve reactants; they can actively direct the course of chemical reactions. This problem delves into the competition between substitution ($S_N2$) and elimination ($E2$) pathways, a classic challenge in organic chemistry.
