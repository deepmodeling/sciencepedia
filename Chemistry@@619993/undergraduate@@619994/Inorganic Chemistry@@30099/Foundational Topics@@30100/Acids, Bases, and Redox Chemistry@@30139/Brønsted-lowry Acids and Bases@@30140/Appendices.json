By determining the species that results from proton donation, you will gain insight into why solutions of many metal salts are acidic, a fundamental concept in coordination and aqueous chemistry.", "problem": "When certain metal salts are dissolved in water, the solution can become acidic. This phenomenon is explained by the Brønsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases, where an acid is defined as a proton ($H^+$) donor, and a base is a proton acceptor. When a Brønsted-Lowry acid donates a proton, the resulting species is known as its conjugate base.\n\nConsider the hexaaquairon(III) ion, a complex ion with the formula $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$ that forms when iron(III) salts dissolve in water.

For a general acid $HA$, this is:\n$$\nHA \\rightleftharpoons A^{-} + H^{+}.\n$$\nIn the hexaaquairon(III) complex, the acidic proton resides on a coordinated water ligand. Deprotonation converts one coordinated $H_{2}O$ (neutral) into $OH^{-}$ (anionic), decreasing the overall complex charge by one unit. The deprotonation in water can be represented as:\n$$\n[Fe(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{3+} + H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons [Fe(H_{2}O)_{5}(OH)]^{2+} + H_{3}O^{+},\n$$\nor equivalently:\n$$\n[Fe(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{3+} \\rightleftharpoons [Fe(H_{2}O)_{5}(OH)]^{2+} + H^{+}.\n$$\nThus, the conjugate base has one hydroxo ligand and a net charge reduced from $+3$ to $+2$, giving the formula $[Fe(H_{2}O)_{5}(OH)]^{2+}$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2236966"}, {"introduction": "Some molecules and ions possess the remarkable ability to function as either an acid or a base depending on the chemical environment; these are known as amphiprotic species.
