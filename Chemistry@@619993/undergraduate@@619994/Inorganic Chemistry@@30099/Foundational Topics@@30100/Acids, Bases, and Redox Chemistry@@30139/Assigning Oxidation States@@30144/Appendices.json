This practice [@problem_id:2234052] challenges you to explore this nuance by calculating the *average* oxidation state of tin in a polynuclear Zintl ion, $[Sn_9]^{4-}$, and contrasting it with the simple integer state in a mononuclear complex. This comparison deepens your appreciation for the oxidation state as a powerful, yet formal, electron-accounting tool.", "problem": "In solid-state chemistry, Zintl ions are polyatomic anions formed by electropositive main-group elements, often exhibiting complex cluster structures. A notable example is the nonastannide ion, which can be found in compounds like $K_4Sn_9$ and has the chemical formula $[Sn_9]^{4-}$.

Then, determine the absolute difference between these two calculated oxidation states.\n\nExpress your final answer for the absolute difference as an improper fraction in its simplest form.", "solution": "The problem asks for the absolute difference between the oxidation states of tin in two different ions: the hexahydroxostannate(IV) ion, $[Sn(OH)_6]^{2-}$, and the nonastannide ion, $[Sn_9]^{4-}$. The solution proceeds in three parts: first, we determine the oxidation state of tin in $[Sn(OH)_6]^{2-}$; second, we find the average oxidation state of tin in $[Sn_9]^{4-}$; and third, we calculate the absolute difference.\n\nThe fundamental principle for assigning oxidation states is that the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a polyatomic ion must equal the overall charge of the ion.\n\nPart 1: Oxidation state of tin in hexahydroxostannate(IV), $[Sn(OH)_6]^{2-}$.\nLet the oxidation state of tin be $x$. The ion contains six hydroxide (OH) groups. According to standard rules, the oxidation state of oxygen is typically $-2$, and the oxidation state of hydrogen is typically $+1$. Therefore, the net oxidation state of a single hydroxide group is $(-2) + (+1) = -1$.\nThe overall charge of the hexahydroxostannate(IV) ion is $-2$. We can set up an equation by summing the oxidation states:\n$$(\\text{Oxidation state of Sn}) + 6 \\times (\\text{Oxidation state of OH}) = \\text{Total Charge}$$\n$$x + 6 \\times (-1) = -2$$\n$$x - 6 = -2$$\nSolving for $x$, we find:\n$$x = -2 + 6 = +4$$\nSo, the oxidation state of tin in $[Sn(OH)_6]^{2-}$ is $+4$. This is consistent with the \"(IV)\" in the ion's name.\n\nPart 2: Average oxidation state of tin in the nonastannide ion, $[Sn_9]^{4-}$.\nLet the average oxidation state of a tin atom in this cluster be $y$. The ion consists of 9 tin atoms and has an overall charge of $-4$.\nWe set up the equation for the sum of oxidation states:\n$$9 \\times (\\text{Average oxidation state of Sn}) = \\text{Total Charge}$$\n$$9y = -4$$\nSolving for $y$, we get:\n$$y = -\\frac{4}{9}$$\nThus, the average oxidation state of tin in the nonastannide ion is $-4/9$.\n\nPart 3: Absolute difference between the two oxidation states.\nWe are asked to find the absolute difference between the oxidation state of tin in the hexahydroxostannate(IV) ion ($x=+4$) and the average oxidation state of tin in the nonastannide ion ($y=-4/9$).\n$$\\text{Absolute Difference} = |x - y|$$\n$$\\text{Absolute Difference} = \\left| (+4) - \\left(-\\frac{4}{9}\\right) \\right|$$\n$$\\text{Absolute Difference} = \\left| 4 + \\frac{4}{9} \\right|$$\nTo add these numbers, we find a common denominator:\n$$4 = \\frac{4 \\times 9}{9} = \\frac{36}{9}$$\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$\\text{Absolute Difference} = \\left| \\frac{36}{9} + \\frac{4}{9} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{36 + 4}{9} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{40}{9} \\right|$$\nThe absolute value is simply $\\frac{40}{9}$. This is an improper fraction. To check if it's in its simplest form, we find the prime factors of the numerator and denominator. The prime factors of $40$ are $2^3 \\times 5$, and the prime factors of $9$ are $3^2$.

This capstone problem [@problem_id:2234036] on the iconic pigment Prussian blue demonstrates this connection beautifully. By synthesizing information about charge neutrality, ligand field strength, and spectroscopy, you will first deduce the distinct oxidation states of two different iron centers and then use that knowledge to predict the compound's magnetic propertiesâ€”a tangible outcome derived directly from this chemical formalism.", "problem": "Prussian blue is an iconic coordination compound with the chemical formula $Fe_4[Fe(CN)_6]_3$. It contains two crystallographically distinct types of iron atoms within its lattice. Let us denote the four iron atoms outside the square brackets as Fe(A) and the three iron atoms inside the square brackets as Fe(B). The structure consists of a cubic framework where Fe(A) and Fe(B) sites are bridged by cyanide ligands.\n\nFrom structural analysis, it is known that the Fe(A) atoms are octahedrally coordinated to the nitrogen atoms of six neighboring cyanide ligands, while the Fe(B) atoms are octahedrally coordinated to the carbon atoms of six cyanide ligands.\n\nTo determine the electronic structure of this material, consider the following set of established physical observations:\n\n1.  The compound is charge-neutral. The cyanide ligand ($CN^-$) always carries a charge of -1. The most common and stable oxidation states for iron in coordination compounds are +2 and +3.\n2.  The brilliant color of Prussian blue is a hallmark of an intervalence charge-transfer (IVCT) transition. This is an electronic excitation where a photon promotes an electron from a lower-oxidation-state metal center to a higher-oxidation-state metal center. The existence of an intense IVCT band necessarily implies that the ground state of the compound contains the same element (iron, in this case) in two different, stable oxidation states.\n3.  The ligand field created by the carbon-donating cyanide ligands at the Fe(B) sites is exceptionally strong. This strong field forces a $d^6$ iron ion into a diamagnetic, low-spin ($t_{2g}^6$) configuration. For a $d^5$ iron ion, this field is also strong enough to produce a low-spin ($t_{2g}^5$) configuration, which is paramagnetic.\n4.  The ligand field created by the nitrogen-donating ends of the bridging cyanide ligands at the Fe(A) sites is significantly weaker. This weak field always results in a high-spin electron configuration for both $d^5$ ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$) and $d^6$ ($t_{2g}^4 e_g^2$) iron ions.\n\nBased on a rigorous synthesis of these four points, calculate the total number of unpaired electrons in a single formula unit of Prussian blue, $Fe_4[Fe(CN)_6]_3$. Provide your answer as an integer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of unpaired electrons in one formula unit of Prussian blue, $Fe_4[Fe(CN)_6]_3$. To find this, we must first determine the oxidation states and spin states of the two types of iron atoms, Fe(A) and Fe(B).\n\nStep 1: Determine the oxidation states of Fe(A) and Fe(B).\nLet the oxidation state of the four Fe(A) atoms be $x$ and the oxidation state of the three Fe(B) atoms be $y$. The cyanide ligand, $CN^-$, has a charge of $-1$. Since there are three $[Fe(CN)_6]$ units, there are a total of $3 \\times 6 = 18$ cyanide ligands. For the entire compound to be charge-neutral (Observation 1), the sum of all oxidation states must be zero:\n$$4x + 3y + 18(-1) = 0$$\n$$4x + 3y = 18$$\nObservation 2 states that the compound exhibits an intervalence charge-transfer (IVCT) transition, which requires the presence of two different oxidation states of iron. The most common stable oxidation states for iron are +2 and +3. Therefore, we must have $\\{x, y\\} = \\{+2, +3\\}$ or $\\{x, y\\} = \\{+3, +2\\}$. Let's test these two possibilities in the charge balance equation.\n\nCase 1: Assume Fe(A) is +2 and Fe(B) is +3.\n$$4(+2) + 3(+3) = 8 + 9 = 17$$\nThis sum is not 18, so this assignment of oxidation states is incorrect and violates the charge neutrality of the compound.\n\nCase 2: Assume Fe(A) is +3 and Fe(B) is +2.\n$$4(+3) + 3(+2) = 12 + 6 = 18$$\nThis sum is 18, which satisfies the charge neutrality condition. This is the only valid assignment of integer oxidation states +2 and +3 to the Fe(A) and Fe(B) atoms that is consistent with both charge neutrality and the existence of an IVCT transition.\nThus, the external iron atoms, Fe(A), are in the +3 oxidation state ($Fe^{3+}$), and the internal iron atoms, Fe(B), are in the +2 oxidation state ($Fe^{2+}$).\n\nStep 2: Determine the electronic configuration and spin state for each iron site.\nWe now use Observations 3 and 4, which describe the effects of the ligand fields.\n\nFor the Fe(A) sites:\n- The oxidation state is +3, so these are $Fe^{3+}$ ions.\n- The electronic configuration of a free $Fe^{3+}$ ion is $[Ar] 3d^5$.\n- Fe(A) is coordinated to the nitrogen ends of the cyanide ligands, which create a weak ligand field (Observation 4).\n- A weak field acting on a $d^5$ ion results in a high-spin configuration. The electronic configuration is $t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$.\n- The number of unpaired electrons for a high-spin $d^5$ ion is 5.\n\nFor the Fe(B) sites:\n- The oxidation state is +2, so these are $Fe^{2+}$ ions.\n- The electronic configuration of a free $Fe^{2+}$ ion is $[Ar] 3d^6$.\n- Fe(B) is coordinated to the carbon ends of the cyanide ligands, which create a strong ligand field (Observation 3).\n- A strong field acting on a $d^6$ ion forces a low-spin configuration, which is specified to be diamagnetic. The electronic configuration is $t_{2g}^6 e_g^0$.\n- The number of unpaired electrons for a low-spin $d^6$ ion is 0.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of unpaired electrons per formula unit.\nThe formula unit is $Fe_4[Fe(CN)_6]_3$. This contains four Fe(A) atoms and three Fe(B) atoms.\n\n- Total unpaired electrons from Fe(A) sites: $4 \\text{ atoms} \\times 5 \\text{ unpaired electrons/atom} = 20$ unpaired electrons.\n- Total unpaired electrons from Fe(B) sites: $3 \\text{ atoms} \\times 0 \\text{ unpaired electrons/atom} = 0$ unpaired electrons.\n\nThe total number of unpaired electrons in one formula unit is the sum of the contributions from all iron atoms:\n$$ \\text{Total unpaired electrons} = 20 + 0 = 20 $$\nThis result is also consistent with the general observation that Prussian blue is a strongly paramagnetic material.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "2234036"}]}
