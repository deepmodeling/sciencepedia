Myoglobin, with its single binding site, provides the simplest model for this interaction. This practice will allow you to apply the fundamental equation that describes non-cooperative binding, calculating the fractional saturation ($Y$) based on the partial pressure of oxygen ($p_{O2}$) and the protein's intrinsic affinity, represented by its half-saturation pressure ($P_{50}$) [@problem_id:2277027].", "problem": "Myoglobin (Mb) is an oxygen-storage protein found in muscle tissue, which is particularly abundant in diving mammals like seals. It binds a single oxygen molecule non-cooperatively. The fractional saturation ($Y$) of myoglobin with oxygen is a function of the partial pressure of oxygen ($p_{O2}$) and can be described by the following equation, which is a specific case of the Hill equation for a protein with a single binding site:\n$$Y = \\frac{p_{O2}}{p_{O2} + P_{50}}$$\nwhere $P_{50}$ is the partial pressure of oxygen at which myoglobin is 50% saturated.\n\nAssume that for a particular species of seal, the myoglobin in its muscle tissue has a $P_{50}$ value of $2.35$ Torr. During a strenuous underwater hunt, the partial pressure of oxygen within its active muscle tissue drops to $7.50$ Torr.

We now perform the division:\n$$Y = \\frac{7.50}{9.85} \\approx 0.761421319...$$\n\nThe problem statement instructs us to round the final answer to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 7, 6, and 1. The fourth digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down, meaning the third significant figure (1) remains unchanged.\n\nThus, the fractional saturation of myoglobin under these conditions is $0.761$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.761}$$", "id": "2277027"}, {"introduction": "While quantifying oxygen binding is essential, a deeper understanding requires exploring the electronic structure of the iron active site. This practice applies Crystal Field Theory, a cornerstone of inorganic chemistry, to model the $\\text{Fe(II)}$ center in oxyhemoglobin.

The active site of hemoglobin contains an iron ion. In its oxygenated form, called oxyhemoglobin, the iron is in the +2 oxidation state ($\\text{Fe(II)}$) and is situated in a coordination environment that can be modeled as a nearly perfect octahedron. The binding of the dioxygen molecule ($O_2$) acts as a strong-field ligand, resulting in a large crystal-field splitting energy ($\\Delta_o$) that is greater than the electron spin-pairing energy (P). Consequently, the $\\text{Fe(II)}$ center adopts a low-spin electronic configuration.\n\nBased on the principles of Crystal Field Theory for a low-spin, d⁶, octahedral $\\text{Fe(II)}$ center in oxyhemoglobin, which one of the following statements is correct?\n\nA.

This final exercise challenges you to analyze how a specific structural modification to a heme-like group impacts its biological function. By considering the electronic effects of a substituent on the porphyrin ring, you will predict the resulting change in oxygen affinity, illustrating the profound connection between molecular structure and the macroscopic properties of a protein [@problem_id:2277043].", "problem": "A team of bioinorganic chemists is studying a novel oxygen-transport protein, named ventoglobin, isolated from a deep-sea worm living near hydrothermal vents. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that ventoglobin contains a heme-like prosthetic group, but with a specific modification compared to the protoporphyrin IX found in human hemoglobin. In ventoglobin's porphyrin, one of the two vinyl groups ($-\\text{CH=CH}_2$) is replaced by a formyl group ($-\\text{CHO}$). All other aspects of the protein's primary and tertiary structure around the heme pocket are assumed to be identical to that of a single subunit of human hemoglobin.\n\nThe affinity of an oxygen-transport protein for dioxygen ($O_2$) is commonly quantified by the $P_{50}$ value, which is the partial pressure of $O_2$ at which half of the binding sites are occupied. A lower $P_{50}$ value indicates a higher affinity. Based on the principles of electronic structure and bonding in coordination complexes, predict how the $P_{50}$ value of ventoglobin would compare to that of human hemoglobin.\n\nSelect the most accurate statement from the choices below.\n\nA. Ventoglobin will exhibit a higher $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group reduces the electron density on the iron center, which in turn diminishes the extent of pi-backbonding from the iron d-orbitals to the $O_2$ $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, thereby weakening the Fe-$O_2$ bond.\n\nB. Ventoglobin will exhibit a lower $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin. The formyl group's electronegative oxygen atom polarizes the heme pocket, enhancing the binding of the slightly polar $O_2$ molecule through favorable electrostatic interactions.\n\nC. Ventoglobin will exhibit a higher $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin. The formyl group is sterically more demanding than the vinyl group, and its presence hinders the approach of the $O_2$ molecule to the iron binding site.\n\nD. Ventoglobin will exhibit a lower $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin. The electron-withdrawing formyl group makes the iron center more electrophilic, which increases its intrinsic Lewis acidity and strengthens its coordination to the electron-donating $O_2$ ligand.\n\nE. The $P_{50}$ values of ventoglobin and hemoglobin will be nearly identical. The substitution occurs on the periphery of the porphyrin macrocycle, and its electronic influence is too attenuated to significantly affect the properties of the central iron atom.", "solution": "We consider dioxygen binding to the heme iron as a simple equilibrium:\n$$\\text{Fe} + O_{2} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Fe--O}_{2}.$$\nDefine the equilibrium constant in concentration form as $K = \\frac{[\\text{Fe--O}_{2}]}{[\\text{Fe}][O_{2}]}$. For gas-phase dioxygen at partial pressure $p_{O_2}$, the site occupancy for a single, independent binding site is\n$$\\theta = \\frac{K' p_{O_2}}{1 + K' p_{O_2}},$$\nwhere $K'$ is the equilibrium constant expressed in pressure units (proportional to $K$ via the solubility relation). By definition, $P_{50}$ is the $p_{O_2}$ at which $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$, hence\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K' P_{50}}{1 + K' P_{50}} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad K' P_{50} = 1 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad P_{50} = \\frac{1}{K'}.$$\nThus, a stronger Fe–$O_{2}$ interaction (larger $K'$) corresponds to a lower $P_{50}$, and a weaker interaction (smaller $K'$) corresponds to a higher $P_{50}$. Thermodynamically, $K' = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right)$, so anything that makes $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ less negative decreases $K'$ and increases $P_{50}$.\n\nThe Fe–$O_{2}$ bond in heme proteins is well described by the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model: it involves $\\sigma$ donation from $O_{2}$ into an empty metal orbital and $\\pi$ backbonding from filled Fe $d$ orbitals into the $O_2$ $\\pi^*$ orbitals, yielding significant $\\text{Fe(III)}–O_{2}^{-}$ character. The strength of this interaction is very sensitive to the electron density at the iron center: greater $d$-electron availability enhances $\\pi$ backbonding into the $O_2$ $\\pi^*$ orbitals, stabilizing the bound superoxo-like form and increasing affinity; reduced $d$-electron availability diminishes backbonding and weakens binding.\n\nReplacing a vinyl group by a formyl group on the porphyrin is a classic electron-withdrawing modification (both inductive and resonance effects) that lowers electron density across the conjugated macrocycle and at the coordinated Fe center. This decreases the metal’s capacity for $\\pi$ backbonding into the $O_2$ $\\pi^*$ orbitals, weakening the Fe–$O_{2}$ bond. Consequently, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for binding becomes less favorable, $K'$ decreases, and $P_{50}$ increases relative to unmodified heme.\n\nAlternative rationales in the options are less accurate: invoking distal electrostatic polarization from a peripheral formyl group (B) is negligible compared to the dominant electronic effect transmitted through the macrocycle; steric hindrance (C) is unlikely because the substituent lies at the porphyrin periphery and formyl is not more encumbering toward the axial site than vinyl; and arguing that greater Lewis acidity alone strengthens binding (D) ignores that $O_{2}$ binding in hemes relies critically on metal-to-ligand $\\pi$ backbonding, which is reduced by electron withdrawal. The notion that the effect is negligible (E) is contradicted by well-established changes in heme electronic properties and ligand affinities upon such substituent modifications.\n\nTherefore, ventoglobin should exhibit a higher $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin due to reduced $\\pi$ backbonding arising from the electron-withdrawing formyl group, matching statement A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2277043"}]}
