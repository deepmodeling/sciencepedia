For safe in vivo applications, the gadolinium ion, which is toxic in its free state, must be tightly bound by a chelating ligand. One of the most stable and widely used chelating agents is DOTA, which stands for 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid.

A fully deprotonated DOTA ligand donates eight donor atoms to the metal center (four ring nitrogens and four carboxylate oxygens), making it octadentate. In the given complex, there is one additional bound water molecule acting as a neutral monodentate ligand, contributing one more donor atom. Therefore, the total coordination number is\n$$\n\\text{CN} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n$$\n\nSecond, for the oxidation state, let the oxidation state of gadolinium be $x$, the charge on fully deprotonated DOTA be $-4$, and the charge on coordinated water be $0$.

However, free aqueous $Gd^{3+}$ is toxic, necessitating its encapsulation within a strongly binding chelating ligand. One of the most successful ligands for this purpose is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). The DOTA ligand consists of a 12-membered macrocyclic ring with four nitrogen atoms, each of which is functionalized with a pendant acetate arm ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{COO}^{-}$). This structure provides eight donor atoms (four nitrogens and four oxygens) that form an exceptionally stable and kinetically inert complex with $Gd^{3+}$.\n\nConsider a hypothetical new ligand, which we will call \"DO2A2T\", designed by modifying the DOTA structure. In DO2A2T, two diametrically opposed acetate arms are replaced with mercaptoacetate arms ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{COS}^{-}$).

Both thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness will remain largely unaffected.", "solution": "We analyze the effects of replacing two carboxylate oxygen donors in DOTA with thiocarboxylate sulfur donors in DO2A2T on both thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of the $Gd^{3+}$ complex using fundamental coordination chemistry principles.\n\nFirst, consider thermodynamic stability as quantified by the formation constant $K_{\\mathrm{f}}$, related to the standard free energy of complexation by $K_{\\mathrm{f}}=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}\\right)$, where $\\Delta G=\\Delta H - T\\Delta S$. For lanthanide(III) ions such as $Gd^{3+}$, the bonding is predominantly ionic and follows hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) preferences: $Gd^{3+}$ is a hard acid (high charge density, low polarizability), which preferentially binds hard bases such as oxygen donors over softer, more polarizable donors such as sulfur. Replacing two carboxylate oxygen donors (hard bases) with thiocarboxylate sulfur donors (softer bases) weakens the metal-ligand bonds enthalpically, making $\\Delta H$ less negative. The macrocyclic and chelate features of the ligand framework (ring size and denticity) remain essentially unchanged, so $\\Delta S$ is expected to be similar. Therefore, $\\Delta G$ becomes less negative, which reduces $K_{\\mathrm{f}}$ because $K_{\\mathrm{f}}=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}\\right)$. Hence, the thermodynamic stability decreases upon O $\\rightarrow$ S substitution in this hard-acid complex.\n\nSecond, consider kinetic inertness, operationally related to the dissociation rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. By transition state theory,\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{off}}=\\kappa \\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the activation free energy for dissociation, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is Planck’s constant, $T$ is temperature, and $\\kappa$ is the transmission coefficient. The kinetic inertness of $Gd(\\mathrm{DOTA})^{-1}$ arises from strong, multidentate coordination within a preorganized macrocycle (macrocyclic effect) and multiple hard donor-metal interactions that impose a large $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for dechelation. Substituting two hard oxygen donors with softer sulfur donors weakens individual metal-ligand interactions and reduces the enthalpic penalty to partially dechelate or open the coordination sphere in the transition state. Consequently, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ decreases, which increases $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ through the exponential factor, thereby decreasing kinetic inertness. Although the macrocyclic topology is retained, the poorer HSAB match of S to $Gd^{3+}$ and the longer, more polarizable Ln–S bonds lead to more labile behavior relative to the all-oxygen analogue.\n\nCombining these points: the O $\\rightarrow$ S substitution in a $Gd^{3+}$ complex decreases thermodynamic stability (lower $K_{\\mathrm{f}}$) and decreases kinetic inertness (higher $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$), compared to $Gd(\\mathrm{DOTA})^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2254674"}]}
