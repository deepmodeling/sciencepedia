The provided trans-directing series is $Cl^- > NH_3$. This means that $Cl^-$ has a stronger effect in labilizing the ligand trans to it than $NH_3$ does.\n\n**Analysis of Pathway A**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with the square planar complex $[PtCl_4]^{2-}$. All four ligands are identical ($Cl^-$), so all positions are equivalent.\n    \n2.  **First Substitution:** The first molecule of ammonia ($NH_3$) substitutes one of the chloride ligands. Since all positions are equivalent, the choice of which $Cl^-$ to replace is random. This step forms the intermediate complex $[Pt(NH_3)Cl_3]^-$.\n    $$[PtCl_4]^{2-} + NH_3 \\rightarrow [Pt(NH_3)Cl_3]^{-} + Cl^{-}$$\n    \n3.  **Second Substitution:** Now, a second molecule of $NH_3$ must substitute another $Cl^-$ ligand in the $[Pt(NH_3)Cl_3]^-$ complex. In this intermediate, there are three $Cl^-$ ligands. Two are positioned *cis* to the $NH_3$ ligand, and one is positioned *trans* to the $NH_3$ ligand. To determine which $Cl^-$ is replaced, we must consider the trans effect of the ligands already present.\n    \n    The ligands directing the substitution are the $NH_3$ and the two $Cl^-$ ligands that are cis to the first $NH_3$.\n    - The $NH_3$ ligand labilizes the $Cl^-$ ligand trans to it.\n    - The two $Cl^-$ ligands that are cis to the $NH_3$ labilize the other $Cl^-$ ligands that are trans to them.\n    \n    According to the given series $Cl^- > NH_3$, the chloride ligand is a stronger trans-director than the ammonia ligand. Therefore, a $Cl^-$ ligand is more effective at labilizing its trans partner than an $NH_3$ ligand is. The incoming $NH_3$ will preferentially substitute a $Cl^-$ that is trans to another $Cl^-$, rather than the $Cl^-$ that is trans to the $NH_3$.\n    \n    A $Cl^-$ that is trans to another $Cl^-$ is, by definition, located at a position *cis* to the first $NH_3$ ligand. Therefore, the second $NH_3$ will add cis to the first one.\n    \n4.  **Final Product of Pathway A:** This substitution results in the two $NH_3$ ligands being adjacent to each other. The product is therefore the **cis** isomer, $cis\\text{-}[Pt(NH_3)_2Cl_2]$.\n\n**Analysis of Pathway B**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** This reaction begins with the square planar complex $[Pt(NH_3)_4]^{2+}$. All four ligands are identical ($NH_3$).\n    \n2.  **First Substitution:** The first chloride ion ($Cl^-$) substitutes one of the ammonia ligands. As all positions are equivalent, this forms the intermediate complex $[Pt(NH_3)_3Cl]^{+}$.\n    $$[Pt(NH_3)_4]^{2+} + Cl^{-} \\rightarrow [Pt(NH_3)_3Cl]^{+} + NH_3$$\n    \n3.  **Second Substitution:** A second $Cl^-$ ion substitutes an $NH_3$ ligand in the $[Pt(NH_3)_3Cl]^+$ complex. In this intermediate, there are three $NH_3$ ligands. Two are positioned *cis* to the $Cl^-$ ligand, and one is positioned *trans* to the $Cl^-$ ligand. We must analyze the trans effect to determine which $NH_3$ is replaced.\n    \n    The ligands directing the substitution are the $Cl^-$ and the two $NH_3$ ligands that are cis to the $Cl^-$.\n    - The $Cl^-$ ligand labilizes the $NH_3$ ligand trans to it.\n    - The $NH_3$ ligands labilize the other $NH_3$ ligands trans to them.\n    \n    From the trans-directing series $Cl^- > NH_3$, the $Cl^-$ ligand is the strongest trans-director present in the complex. It will most strongly labilize the $NH_3$ ligand positioned trans to it.\n    \n    Therefore, the incoming $Cl^-$ ion will preferentially replace the $NH_3$ molecule that is trans to the first $Cl^-$ ligand.\n    \n4.  **Final Product of Pathway B:** This substitution results in the two $Cl^-$ ligands being opposite to each other.
