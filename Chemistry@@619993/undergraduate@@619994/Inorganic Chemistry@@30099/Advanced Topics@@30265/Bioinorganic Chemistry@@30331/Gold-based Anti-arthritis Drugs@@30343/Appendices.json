In this complex, the central gold atom is in the +3 oxidation state and exhibits a square planar geometry. The ligands are a bromide ion (Br), a chloride ion (Cl), a neutral ammonia molecule (NH₃), and a neutral pyridine molecule, for which `py` is the standard abbreviation.\n\nAssuming all ligands act as monodentate ligands, determine the total number of possible distinct geometric isomers for this `[Au(Br)(Cl)(NH_3)(py)]` complex.\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. 4\nE. 6\n\n", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of distinct geometric isomers for a square planar complex with the formula `[Au(Br)(Cl)(NH_3)(py)]`.\n\nFirst, let's identify the components of the coordination complex:\n- Central metal ion: Au(III)\n- Geometry: Square planar\n- Ligands: Four different monodentate ligands, which we can label as a, b, c, and d. Let a = Br, b = Cl, c = NH₃, and d = py. The general formula is thus `[M(a)(b)(c)(d)]`.\n\nGeometric isomers in square planar complexes arise from the different spatial arrangements of the ligands around the central metal ion. The key to systematically counting the isomers is to consider the relative positions of the ligands. In a square planar geometry, ligands can be either *cis* to each other (adjacent, at a 90-degree angle) or *trans* to each other (opposite, at a 180-degree angle). An isomer is uniquely defined by the pairs of ligands that are *trans* to one another.\n\nWe can systematically enumerate the isomers by picking a reference ligand and considering which of the other three ligands can be placed in the position *trans* to it. Let's choose the bromide ligand (Br) as our reference point.\n\n1.  **Case 1: The chloride ligand (Cl) is *trans* to the bromide ligand (Br).**\n    In this arrangement, the Br and Cl ligands occupy opposite corners of the square. The remaining two ligands, ammonia (NH₃) and pyridine (py), must then occupy the other two opposite corners. Therefore, NH₃ must be *trans* to py. This configuration, where the trans pairs are (Br, Cl) and (NH₃, py), defines one unique geometric isomer.\n\n2.  **Case 2: The ammonia ligand (NH₃) is *trans* to the bromide ligand (Br).**\n    In this arrangement, Br and NH₃ occupy opposite corners. The remaining two ligands, chloride (Cl) and pyridine (py), must occupy the other pair of opposite corners. Thus, Cl must be *trans* to py. This configuration, where the trans pairs are (Br, NH₃) and (Cl, py), defines a second, distinct geometric isomer.\n\n3.  **Case 3: The pyridine ligand (py) is *trans* to the bromide ligand (Br).**\n    In this arrangement, Br and py occupy opposite corners. The remaining two ligands, chloride (Cl) and ammonia (NH₃), must occupy the final pair of opposite corners. Therefore, Cl must be *trans* to NH₃. This configuration, where the trans pairs are (Br, py) and (Cl, NH₃), defines a third distinct geometric isomer.\n\nThese three cases exhaust all possibilities for the ligand trans to Br. Any other choice of reference ligand would simply regenerate the same set of three isomers. For instance, if we started by fixing Cl and considered ligands trans to it, we would find Br trans to Cl (Case 1), NH₃ trans to Cl (equivalent to Case 3), and py trans to Cl (equivalent to Case 2).\n\nTherefore, for a square planar complex of the type `[M(a)(b)(c)(d)]` where a, b, c, and d are all different, there are exactly three possible geometric isomers.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. 4\nE. 6\n\nThe correct number of isomers is 3, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$"}, {"introduction": "Bridging the gap between molecular formulas and real-world applications, stoichiometry is the cornerstone of quantitative chemical analysis.
