This exercise challenges you to act like a spectroscopist, using key experimental observations—color and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) activity—to deduce the oxidation state and d-electron configuration of copper in its two functional forms. Mastering this connection between observable properties and underlying electronic structure is a cornerstone of bioinorganic chemistry.

The copper ion at the active site cycles between two different oxidation states to facilitate this process. Experimental characterization of plastocyanin reveals two distinct forms:\n\n-   Form A is characterized by an intense blue color, a property that gives this class of proteins its name ('blue copper proteins'). It is also found to be 'active' in Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, meaning it produces a distinct signal.\n-   Form B is colorless and is 'silent' in EPR spectroscopy, producing no signal.\n\nBased on fundamental principles of transition metal chemistry, determine the number of d-electrons for the copper ion in Form A and Form B, respectively. Present your answer as a two-element row matrix, where the first element is the d-electron count for the copper ion in Form A (the blue, EPR-active form) and the second element is the d-electron count for the copper ion in Form B (the colorless, EPR-silent form).", "solution": "We proceed by identifying the oxidation states of copper in the two forms and translating those into $d$-electron counts.\n\nFirst, plastocyanin operates via a redox couple between two oxidation states of copper. For copper, the relevant oxidation states in biological electron transfer are $\\text{Cu}^{\\text{II}}$ and $\\text{Cu}^{\\text{I}}$.\n\nSecond, we use the EPR criterion. EPR activity requires at least one unpaired electron (paramagnetism), while EPR silence indicates no unpaired electrons (diamagnetism). Among common copper oxidation states, $\\text{Cu}^{\\text{II}}$ has one unpaired electron, whereas $\\text{Cu}^{\\text{I}}$ is closed shell.\n\nThird, we use color as a corroborating spectroscopic signature. $\\text{Cu}^{\\text{II}}$ centers in blue copper proteins display an intense blue color due to a strong ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition, while $\\text{Cu}^{\\text{I}}$ ($d^{10}$, with no $d$-$d$ transitions) is typically colorless.\n\nHence, Form A (blue, EPR-active) is assigned as $\\text{Cu}^{\\text{II}}$, and Form B (colorless, EPR-silent) as $\\text{Cu}^{\\text{I}}$.\n\nTo determine the $d$-electron counts, we use either the electron configuration argument or the group-number rule. Copper is in group $11$, so the d-electron count for a copper center in oxidation state $x$ is\n$$\n\\text{d-count} = 11 - x.\n$$\nTherefore,\n- For Form A: $x=2 \\implies \\text{d-count} = 11 - 2 = 9$, i.e., $d^{9}$.\n- For Form B: $x=1 \\implies \\text{d-count} = 11 - 1 = 10$, i.e., $d^{10}$.\n\nThus the requested two-element row matrix, with the first element for Form A and the second for Form B, is $[9,\\,10]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2235447"}, {"introduction": "The intense blue color of blue copper proteins is one of their most defining features, arising not from simple d-d transitions, but from a powerful charge-transfer mechanism.

Their active sites feature a single copper ion in a distorted coordination environment. The uniquely intense blue color of these proteins is not due to the copper ion's d-d transitions, which are typically weak, but rather to a strong Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT) band. This specific transition involves an electron moving from a p-orbital of a cysteine residue's thiolate ligand (S⁻) to a partially filled d-orbital on the Cu(II) center. The peak of this absorption band ($\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$) occurs at approximately 600 nm.\n\nImagine a biochemical experiment where site-directed mutagenesis is used to modify the protein. The crucial cysteine residue that provides the thiolate ligand is replaced by a serine residue. The serine residue coordinates to the copper center through its hydroxyl/alkoxide oxygen atom.

The color changes from blue to a bright yellow.", "solution": "The intense blue color of type 1 (blue) copper proteins arises from a strong Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT) transition in which an electron moves from a thiolate sulfur $p$ orbital on cysteine to an acceptor $d$ orbital on the Cu(II) center. The energy of such an LMCT transition can be approximated as the difference between acceptor and donor orbital energies,\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{LMCT}} \\approx \\varepsilon_{d,\\text{Cu(II)}} - \\varepsilon_{p,\\text{L}} ,\n$$\nand its absorption maximum satisfies\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{h c}{\\Delta E_{\\text{LMCT}}}.\n$$\nA cysteine thiolate is a soft, strongly donating ligand with relatively high-energy $3p$ orbitals compared to oxygen donors.

Sulfur $3p$ orbitals are more radially diffuse and mix more strongly with Cu $3d$ orbitals than oxygen $2p$ orbitals, so replacing S with O decreases the overlap and thus decreases $f$, further weakening the band.\n\nTherefore, the Cys-to-Ser mutation simultaneously blue-shifts and diminishes the LMCT band, effectively removing the characteristic intense blue absorption from the visible region. The remaining $d$–$d$ transitions of Cu(II) are Laporte-forbidden and weak, so the protein becomes colorless or only very faintly colored. The outcome is not an intensification of the blue, nor a specific shift to a different vivid visible color independent of ligand identity.\n\nThe most likely consequence is that the protein becomes colorless or very faintly colored.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2235432"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their unique color, the primary function of blue copper proteins is to mediate electron transfer, a role governed by their reduction potential ($E^{\\circ}$).

Three strong, short bonds are formed in a trigonal plane with two histidine nitrogen atoms and one cysteine sulfur atom.
