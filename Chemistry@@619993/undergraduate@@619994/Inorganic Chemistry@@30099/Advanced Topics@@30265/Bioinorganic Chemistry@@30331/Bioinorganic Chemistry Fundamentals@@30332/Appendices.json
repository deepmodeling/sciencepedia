By analyzing the coordination environment of the zinc ion in a peptidase, you will apply fundamental principles of coordination chemistry to identify a suitable small-molecule mimic, bridging the gap between laboratory synthesis and biological structure.", "problem": "Many metalloenzymes utilize metal ions in their active sites to perform catalytic functions. A prominent example is the family of zinc-containing peptidases, such as carboxypeptidase A, which play a crucial role in protein digestion. In these enzymes, the active site consists of a Zinc(II) ion, which is crucial for activating a water molecule to hydrolyze a peptide bond. Spectroscopic and crystallographic studies reveal that the Zn(II) ion is situated in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment, bound by a combination of nitrogen donor atoms from histidine residues and oxygen donor atoms from carboxylate-containing residues (glutamate or aspartate) and the catalytic water molecule itself.\n\nAn inorganic chemist wishes to synthesize a simple, air-stable coordination complex using common laboratory reagents to serve as a basic structural model for this active site. Which of the following coordination complexes would be the most suitable structural mimic for the active site of a zinc-containing peptidase as described?\n\n(In the options below, `py` denotes pyridine, and `OAc⁻` denotes the acetate anion, CH₃COO⁻).\n\nA. $[Zn(py)₂(OAc)₂]$\n\nB. $[Zn(H₂O)₆]^{2+}$\n\nC. $[Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂]$\n\nD. $[Co(NH₃)₆]^{3+}$\n\nE. $[Cu(NH₃)₄(H₂O)₂]^{2+}$", "solution": "We first extract the essential structural and chemical features of the zinc-containing peptidase active site from the description:\n- The metal is Zn(II), which is a $d^{10}$ ion. As a $d^{10}$ center, Zn(II) has negligible ligand field stabilization energy differences between common geometries; in proteins it frequently adopts a four-coordinate, distorted tetrahedral geometry due to steric and binding-site constraints.\n- The donor set is mixed: nitrogen donors from histidine (neutral N donors) and oxygen donors from carboxylate residues (anionic O donors from aspartate/glutamate) and a bound water/hydroxide. Thus, the primary coordination sphere is mixed N/O, with both neutral and anionic ligands.\n- A suitable small-molecule structural model should therefore feature Zn(II), an overall four-coordinate, distorted tetrahedral geometry, and a mixed N/O donor set (with carboxylate-like O donors and neutral N donors). It should be simple, common, and air-stable.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these criteria:\n\nA. $[Zn(py)_{2}(OAc)_{2}]$. This complex contains Zn(II) coordinated by two neutral nitrogen donors (pyridine, mimicking histidine’s imidazole as a neutral N donor) and two anionic carboxylate-type oxygen donors (acetate, mimicking Asp/Glu). The formulation $[Zn(OAc)_{2}(py)_{2}]$ commonly affords a four-coordinate Zn center with an $N_{2}O_{2}$ donor set in a distorted tetrahedral geometry when the acetates bind in monodentate fashion, which is a well-known structural motif for Zn(II) with mixed N/O donors. It is synthetically simple (from Zn(OAc)_{2} and pyridine) and air-stable. This matches the enzyme active site’s Zn(II), mixed N/O donor set, and distorted tetrahedral coordination environment, making it an appropriate structural mimic.\n\nB. $[Zn(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$. This is a six-coordinate, octahedral aqua complex with only O donors from water. It does not reproduce the tetrahedral geometry nor the mixed N/O donor set; therefore it is not a suitable structural mimic.\n\nC. $[Pt(NH_3)_2Cl_2]$. This is a square-planar $d^{8}$ Pt(II) complex with different metal, geometry, and donor set ($Cl^{-}$ and $NH_{3}$). It does not model Zn(II) tetrahedral N/O coordination.\n\nD. $[Co(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$. This is an octahedral Co(III) complex with six neutral N donors and a different metal and oxidation state. It neither matches the geometry nor the donor mix of the Zn(II) active site.\n\nE. $[Cu(NH_3)_4(H_2O)_2]^{2+}$. This is typically a six-coordinate, Jahn–Teller distorted Cu(II) complex ($d^{9}$), with mostly N donors and two O donors from water. It does not reproduce the Zn(II) metal identity or the four-coordinate tetrahedral geometry characteristic of the peptidase active site.\n\nBy matching the zinc oxidation state, mixed N/O donor set (neutral N and carboxylate O donors), and a likely distorted tetrahedral, four-coordinate environment, along with synthetic simplicity and air stability, option A is the most suitable structural mimic.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2235195"}, {"introduction": "Beyond providing a structural scaffold, the protein environment actively fine-tunes the electronic properties of its metal cofactors. This is critical for electron-transfer proteins like cytochromes, whose function depends on a precisely set reduction potential, $E^\\circ$ [@problem_id:2235206]. This problem challenges you to predict how a specific mutation near the iron center—swapping one ligand for another with different electronic properties—will alter this potential, demonstrating how simple changes in coordination can have profound effects on a protein's function.", "problem": "In a bioinorganic chemistry laboratory, a research team is studying a wild-type c-type cytochrome. In this protein, the heme iron is coordinated in an octahedral geometry. The four equatorial positions are occupied by the porphyrin ring, while the two axial positions are occupied by a histidine residue and a methionine residue. The standard reduction potential, $E^\\circ$, for the $Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}$ couple in this wild-type cytochrome is measured.\n\nThe team then creates a mutant version of the protein using site-directed mutagenesis. In this mutant, the axial methionine residue is replaced by a histidine residue. The experiment is conducted in a buffer solution where the pH is sufficiently high to ensure that this new histidine's side chain is deprotonated, acting as an anionic imidazolate ligand. All other structural aspects of the protein are assumed to remain unchanged.\n\nBased on the principles of coordination chemistry, predict the effect of this substitution on the standard reduction potential ($E^\\circ$) of the heme iron center.\n\nA. The substitution will cause the standard reduction potential to become significantly more positive.\n\nB. The substitution will cause the standard reduction potential to become significantly more negative.\n\nC. The standard reduction potential will remain essentially unchanged, as the porphyrin macrocycle is the dominant factor.\n\nD. The substitution will cause the standard reduction potential to become slightly more positive.\n\nE. The effect on the potential cannot be determined without knowing the $pK_a$ of the methionine residue.", "solution": "Consider the one-electron half-reaction at the heme iron,\n$$Fe^{3+} + e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons Fe^{2+}.$$\nThe standard reduction potential is related to the standard Gibbs free energy change by\n$$E^{\\circ} = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{nF},$$\nwith $n=1$ for this half-reaction and $F$ the Faraday constant. By definition,\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = G^{\\circ}(Fe^{2+}) - G^{\\circ}(Fe^{3+}).$$\n\nLet $s_{q}(L)$ denote the stabilization (a positive quantity representing a lowering of $G^{\\circ}$) of the iron center in oxidation state $q \\in \\{2+,3+\\}$ conferred by an axial ligand $L$. Upon replacing a neutral methionine thioether (denote $L=Met^{0}$) with an anionic imidazolate (denote $L=Im^{-}$), the standard free energies transform as\n$$G^{\\circ}_{L}(Fe^{q+}) = G^{\\circ}(Fe^{q+}) - s_{q}(L).$$\nTherefore, the standard free energy change for the redox couple under ligand $L$ is\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{L} = G^{\\circ}_{L}(Fe^{2+}) - G^{\\circ}_{L}(Fe^{3+}) = \\Delta G^{\\circ} - \\big(s_{2+}(L) - s_{3+}(L)\\big) = \\Delta G^{\\circ} + \\big(s_{3+}(L) - s_{2+}(L)\\big).$$\nConsequently, the corresponding standard potential is\n$$E^{\\circ}_{L} = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{L}}{F} = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{F} - \\frac{s_{3+}(L) - s_{2+}(L)}{F}.$$\n\nCoordination chemistry principles (HSAB and ligand basicity) imply that a more basic, anionic donor such as imidazolate provides stronger $\\sigma$ donation and greater electrostatic stabilization to the harder, more highly charged $Fe^{3+}$ center than to $Fe^{2+}$. Thus,\n$$s_{3+}(Im^{-}) > s_{2+}(Im^{-}).$$\nInserting this inequality into the expression for $E^{\\circ}_{L}$ yields\n$$E^{\\circ}_{Im^{-}} = E^{\\circ} - \\frac{s_{3+}(Im^{-}) - s_{2+}(Im^{-})}{F}  E^{\\circ},$$\ni.e., the standard reduction potential shifts to more negative values.\n\nThe magnitude of this shift is expected to be substantial because the substitution changes the axial ligand from a neutral thioether (methionine) to an anionic, strongly donating imidazolate, altering both the electrostatic environment and metal-ligand covalency in a way known to produce large negative shifts in heme $E^{\\circ}$. The porphyrin macrocycle remains unchanged, but axial-ligand identity and charge are well established as major determinants of heme redox tuning, so the effect does not vanish. The buffer pH is specified to ensure the histidine is deprotonated; methionine’s thioether is not protonated under these conditions, so no $pK_a$ of methionine is relevant.\n\nTherefore, the substitution will cause the standard reduction potential to become significantly more negative.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2235206"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand how an enzyme works, we must follow the atoms through the course of the reaction.

This exercise demonstrates how chemists act as molecular detectives to unravel complex biological pathways.", "problem": "A bioinorganic chemist is investigating the mechanism of a zinc-dependent metalloprotease. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds. To trace the origin of atoms in the products, an experiment is conducted using the dipeptide substrate Alanyl-Leucine (Ala-Leu). The enzymatic hydrolysis is performed in a buffer prepared with water that has been isotopically enriched with heavy oxygen, $H_2^{18}O$. The overall reaction breaks the peptide bond to yield the constituent amino acids, Alanine and Leucine.\n\nGiven the general mechanism for this class of enzymes, where a zinc-activated water molecule acts as the primary nucleophile, identify the location of the $^{18}O$ label in the final products of the reaction.\n\nA.

In zinc-dependent metalloproteases, the catalytic $Zn^{2+}$ coordinates the peptide carbonyl oxygen to increase electrophilicity at the carbonyl carbon, and also activates a bound water molecule (often as $Zn-OH$) to act as the primary nucleophile. The key mechanistic step is nucleophilic acyl substitution at the peptide carbonyl carbon by the zinc-activated water.\n\nLet the nucleophile be $H_2^{18}O$. The zinc-activated water donates its oxygen lone pair to the peptide carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. In this tetrahedral adduct, the oxygen originating from $H_2^{18}O$ is now bonded to the former carbonyl carbon. Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate then occurs with cleavage of the $C-N$ bond, releasing the amine fragment derived from the Leu residue. Proton transfer from solvent furnishes the free amine $H_2N-R^{\\text{Leu}}$.\n\nIn nucleophilic acyl substitution, the atom from the incoming nucleophile that binds to the acyl carbon remains in the acyl product as the substituent that becomes the hydroxyl of the carboxylic acid (or carboxylate). Therefore, the $^{18}O$ from $H_2^{18}O$ becomes the hydroxyl oxygen of the carboxyl group on the acyl fragment. Here, the acyl fragment is the Ala side ($R^{\\text{Ala}}$), since the scissile carbonyl belongs to the Ala residue in Ala-Leu. The Leu fragment departs as the amine and does not receive the oxygen from water; it instead is protonated.\n\nThus, the labeled oxygen is incorporated specifically into the carboxylate group of the Alanine product, i.e.,\n$$R^{\\text{Ala}}-C(=O)-^{18}OH \\quad \\text{and} \\quad H_2N-R^{\\text{Leu}}.$$\n\nThis excludes incorporation into the Leu carboxylate, excludes incorporation into an enzyme tyrosine hydroxyl (the nucleophile is water, not a protein side chain), excludes equal distribution (a single nucleophilic event places one $^{18}O$ at a defined position), and excludes formation of hydrogen peroxide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2235233"}]}
