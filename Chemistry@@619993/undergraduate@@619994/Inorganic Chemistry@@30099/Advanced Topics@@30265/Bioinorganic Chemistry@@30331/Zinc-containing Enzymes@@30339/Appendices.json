In carbonic anhydrase, the active site metal is $Zn^{2+}$, which in proteins typically adopts a four-coordinate, approximately tetrahedral geometry. In the well-characterized alpha-class carbonic anhydrases (e.g., human carbonic anhydrase II), the primary coordination sphere consists of three imidazole nitrogens from histidine residues (classically His94, His96, His119) and a solvent ligand. In the resting, hydrated state prior to catalysis, this solvent ligand is a bound water molecule, which is polarized by $Zn^{2+}$; deprotonation of this bound water to form a zinc-bound hydroxide occurs during activation and is essential for nucleophilic attack on $\\mathrm{CO}_2$. Thus, the resting hydrated state is best described as three histidines plus one water in a tetrahedral environment.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A describes three histidines and a hydroxide, tetrahedral. This corresponds to the deprotonated, nucleophilic zinc-bound hydroxide form after proton transfer, not the hydrated resting state before catalysis begins.\n- B describes four cysteines, tetrahedral, which is characteristic of zinc finger proteins, not carbonic anhydrase.\n- C proposes square planar geometry for $Zn^{2+}$ with two histidines, one glutamate, and one water; square planar is atypical for $Zn^{2+}$ and the ligand set does not match carbonic anhydrase.\n- D describes three histidines and one water in a tetrahedral geometry, which matches the established resting, hydrated state of carbonic anhydrase.\n- E proposes an octahedral environment with only four specified ligands; this is inconsistent with both the known tetrahedral coordination in carbonic anhydrase and with octahedral six-coordinate requirements.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is three histidine residues and one water molecule in a tetrahedral geometry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2300018"}, {"introduction": "With the static structure of the active site established, we can now explore the dynamic process of catalysis. The incredible speed of carbonic anhydrase depends not only on the zinc ion itself but also on the regeneration of its active form, a step which can be rate-limiting.

[@problem_id:2299980]", "problem": "Human Carbonic Anhydrase II (CAII) is a metalloenzyme containing a zinc(II) ion at its active site. It catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate, a critical reaction for pH regulation and CO2 transport in the body. The catalytic mechanism proceeds in two main stages. The first is the rapid nucleophilic attack on a CO2 molecule by a Zn(II)-coordinated hydroxide ion. The second stage, which is the rate-limiting step for the overall reaction under physiological conditions (pH near 7.4), is the regeneration of the active Zn(II)-OH species. This involves the deprotonation of a Zn(II)-coordinated water molecule. In the native enzyme, the amino acid residue Histidine-64 (His64) is strategically positioned to act as an intramolecular proton shuttle, accepting a proton from the bound water and transferring it to buffer molecules in the bulk solution.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered variant of CAII in which His64 is replaced by Alanine (Ala) through site-directed mutagenesis. Alanine is an amino acid with a nonpolar, non-ionizable methyl side group.

Consequently, the proton transfer must proceed via a slower, intermolecular pathway with bulk buffer, which substantially decreases $k_{3}$ and therefore\n$$\nk_{cat} \\downarrow \\ \\text{significantly}.\n$$\n\nFor $K_{M}$, two complementary arguments show little expected change:\n- Structural/functional argument: His64 is not a substrate-binding determinant and does not participate in the Zn(II) coordination that engages $\\mathrm{CO}_2$. With the overall fold and active-site geometry assumed unchanged, $k_{1}$ (association) and $k_{-1}$ (dissociation) for $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ binding are expected to remain largely the same.
