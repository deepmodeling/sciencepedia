The stretching frequency of the carbon-oxygen bond, denoted as $ν_{CO}$, is particularly informative. Consider the following three tetrahedral metal carbonyl complexes, which are isoelectronic (i.e., they possess the same total number of electrons): $[Fe(CO)_4]^{2-}$, $[Co(CO)_4]^-$, and $Ni(CO)_4$.\n\nBased on the principles of molecular orbital theory and metal-ligand bonding, arrange these three complexes in order of decreasing average $ν_{CO}$ stretching frequency.\n\nA. $Ni(CO)_4 > [Co(CO)_4]^- > [Fe(CO)_4]^{2-}$\n\nB. $[Fe(CO)_4]^{2-} > [Co(CO)_4]^- > Ni(CO)_4$\n\nC. $[Co(CO)_4]^- > Ni(CO)_4 > [Fe(CO)_4]^{2-}$\n\nD. All three complexes will have approximately the same $ν_{CO}$ because they are isoelectronic.\n\nE. $Ni(CO)_4 > [Fe(CO)_4]^{2-} > [Co(CO)_4]^-$", "solution": "We compare the average carbon–oxygen stretching frequency $ν_{CO}$ in the isoelectronic tetrahedral carbonyls $[Fe(CO)_{4}]^{2-}$, $[Co(CO)_{4}]^{-}$, and $Ni(CO)_{4}$ by relating it to the C–O bond force constant via the harmonic oscillator model. For a diatomic vibration,\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}},\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the C–O bond and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of CO. Since $\\mu$ is the same for all three complexes, differences in $ν_{CO}$ directly reflect differences in $k$.\n\nIn metal carbonyls, $k$ decreases as metal-to-ligand $\\pi$ back-donation increases. Back-donation involves donation of metal $d$ electrons into the ligand $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals of CO, which weakens the C–O bond by populating antibonding orbitals and thus lowers $k$ and hence $ν_{CO}$. Therefore, stronger $\\pi$ back-donation implies a lower $ν_{CO}$.\n\nThe strength of $\\pi$ back-donation increases with the electron richness and reducing power of the metal center. Considering formal oxidation states and $d$-electron counts in these isoelectronic 18-electron, tetrahedral complexes:\n- $Ni(CO)_{4}$ has Ni in oxidation state $0$ (formally $d^{10}$).\n- $[Co(CO)_{4}]^{-}$ has Co in oxidation state $-1$ (formally $d^{10}$) and is more electron rich than Ni.\n- $[Fe(CO)_{4}]^{2-}$ has Fe in oxidation state $-2$ (formally $d^{10}$) and is the most electron rich.\n\nGreater negative charge on the metal center increases the electron density available for $\\pi$ back-donation into CO $\\pi^{*}$. Consequently, the $\\pi$ back-donation increases in the order\n$$\nNi(CO)_{4} < [Co(CO)_{4}]^{-} < [Fe(CO)_{4}]^{2-}.\n$$\nTherefore, the C–O force constant $k$ and thus $ν_{CO}$ decrease in the same order.

While we know carbon monoxide almost always coordinates to a single metal in a linear, \"end-on\" fashion ($\\eta^1$-CO), it is instructive to ask *why* this is the case. This exercise [@problem_id:2236254] pushes beyond simple electron counting and asks you to analyze the bonding from a molecular orbital perspective, evaluating the efficiency of orbital overlap for both the standard $\\eta^1$-mode and a hypothetical \"side-on\" $\\eta^2$-mode to explain the observed structural preference.", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, the synergic bonding model describes the interaction between a metal center and ligands like carbon monoxide (CO). The most common coordination mode for a CO ligand to a single metal center is terminal or end-on, denoted as $\\eta^1$-CO, where the metal is bonded to the carbon atom and the M-C-O atoms are nearly linear. An alternative, hypothetical coordination mode is side-on, denoted as $\\eta^2$-CO, where the metal interacts simultaneously with both the carbon and oxygen atoms, sitting adjacent to the C-O bond.\n\nFrom a molecular orbital perspective, the stability of the metal-CO bond relies on two main interactions: a sigma ($\\sigma$) donation from a filled ligand orbital to an empty metal orbital, and a pi ($\\pi$) back-donation from a filled metal orbital to an empty ligand orbital. The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of free CO is the $5\\sigma$ orbital, which is primarily a lone pair on the carbon atom. The Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMOs) are a pair of degenerate $\\pi^*$ antibonding orbitals.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements best explains why the side-on ($\\eta^2$) coordination of a single CO ligand to a single low-valent transition metal center is electronically unfavorable and therefore rarely observed?\n\nA. The side-on geometry leads to significant steric repulsion between the oxygen atom and other ligands bound to the metal, making the complex sterically unstable regardless of electronic effects.\n\nB. The $\\sigma$-donation from the CO ligand to the metal is much stronger in the $\\eta^2$ mode because it involves a filled $\\pi$ bonding orbital, but this is counteracted by a complete absence of $\\pi$-backbonding.\n\nC. Both the $\\sigma$-donation and $\\pi$-backbonding components of the synergic bond are electronically inefficient in the $\\eta^2$ geometry. The donor orbital on CO is a poor $\\sigma$-donor, and the orbital symmetry for $\\pi$-backbonding results in near-zero net overlap.\n\nD. While the $\\sigma$-donation from the CO ligand is comparable in strength to the $\\eta^1$ case, the $\\pi$-backbonding is completely forbidden by symmetry, as the metal d-orbitals and the CO $\\pi^*$ orbitals are orthogonal.\n\nE. The primary donor orbital in the $\\eta^2$ mode, the filled C-O $\\pi$ bonding orbital, is too low in energy, preventing any significant $\\sigma$-donation to the metal and thus destabilizing the entire interaction.", "solution": "We analyze the two key components of synergic bonding between a metal and CO: ligand-to-metal $\\sigma$ donation and metal-to-ligand $\\pi$ back-donation. The relevant ligand orbitals are the occupied $5\\sigma$ (lone pair localized primarily on carbon, oriented along the C–O bond axis) and the degenerate empty $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals perpendicular to that axis.\n\nFor terminal end-on $\\eta^{1}$-CO, the metal approaches along the C–O axis toward carbon. The $\\sigma$ donation arises from overlap of the CO $5\\sigma$ with an empty metal orbital of appropriate symmetry along the M–C axis (e.g., $d_{z^{2}}$, $s$, or $p_{z}$), giving a large overlap integral\n$$\nS_{\\sigma}^{\\eta^{1}}=\\int \\phi_{5\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\phi_{M}^{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau \\quad \\text{large},\n$$\nand $\\pi$ backbonding arises from overlap of filled metal $\\pi$-type orbitals (e.g., $d_{\\pi}$) with one of the CO $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals oriented to accept density from the metal, giving\n$$\nS_{\\pi}^{\\eta^{1}}=\\int \\phi_{\\pi^{*}}(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\phi_{M}^{\\pi}(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau \\quad \\text{large}.\n$$\nThe stabilization from each donor–acceptor interaction scales approximately as\n$$\n\\Delta E \\propto -\\frac{\\beta^{2}}{\\Delta \\varepsilon}, \\quad \\text{with } \\beta \\propto S,\n$$\nso large $S$ for both components yields strong synergic stabilization in the $\\eta^{1}$ mode.\n\nFor side-on $\\eta^{2}$-CO to a single metal, the metal approaches perpendicular to the C–O bond and attempts to interact with both C and O simultaneously. This geometry disrupts both components of the synergic bond:\n\n1) $\\sigma$ donation is electronically inefficient. The strong donor orbital of CO is $5\\sigma$, directed along the C–O axis toward carbon. In the $\\eta^{2}$ geometry, the metal lies adjacent to the side of the C–O bond, so the direction from CO toward the metal is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the $5\\sigma$ lone pair. Consequently, the overlap integral\n$$\nS_{\\sigma}^{\\eta^{2}}=\\int \\phi_{5\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\phi_{M}^{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau \\approx 0,\n$$\nis small by orientation, making $5\\sigma \\to$ metal donation weak. Donation from the CO $\\pi$ bonding orbital is not a good substitute: it is lower in energy and its nodal structure gives poor head-on overlap for $\\sigma$ donation in this geometry. Thus the primary $\\sigma$-donor channel is intrinsically poor in $\\eta^{2}$ with a single metal.\n\n2) $\\pi$ backbonding is electronically inefficient by symmetry. The two degenerate $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals of CO have opposite phases on C and O. In the $\\eta^{2}$ side-on arrangement, a single metal $d$ orbital attempting to donate into both atoms simultaneously will necessarily engage one lobe of a $\\pi^{*}$ orbital in bonding overlap while engaging the corresponding lobe on the other atom in antibonding overlap, because a single $d$ orbital cannot present the same phase toward both C and O along directions that straddle its nodal planes. When the metal tries to overlap with the pair of $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations lead to substantial cancellation of the net first-order overlap:\n$$\nS_{\\pi,\\text{net}}^{\\eta^{2}} \\approx S_{\\pi^{*}_{1}}+S_{\\pi^{*}_{2}} \\approx 0,\n$$\nso the effective backbonding stabilization,\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\pi}^{\\eta^{2}} \\propto -\\frac{(S_{\\pi,\\text{net}}^{\\eta^{2}})^{2}}{\\Delta \\varepsilon},\n$$\nis very small. In contrast, end-on binding localizes backbonding into a single $\\pi^{*}$ lobe on carbon with favorable phase, avoiding cancellation.\n\nBecause both $\\sigma$ donation and $\\pi$ backbonding are weakened simultaneously in the $\\eta^{2}$ geometry for a single metal, the overall synergic stabilization collapses, rendering $\\eta^{2}$-CO binding electronically unfavorable and rarely observed for single, low-valent metal centers. This analysis directly supports option C.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nA is incorrect because sterics are not the fundamental reason; even in electronically idealized cases, $\\eta^{2}$ is disfavored by poor orbital interactions.\nB is incorrect because $\\sigma$ donation is not stronger in $\\eta^{2}$; it is weaker due to poor overlap of $5\\sigma$ with the side-on approach, and $\\pi$ backbonding is not entirely absent but rather inefficient with near-cancellation.\nD is incorrect because $\\pi$ backbonding is not strictly symmetry-forbidden; it is permitted but suffers destructive interference leading to small net overlap, not zero by absolute symmetry in all cases.\nE is incorrect because the primary donor in CO remains $5\\sigma$; invoking the $\\pi$ bonding orbital as the primary donor misidentifies the donor channel and misattributes the weakness to energy alone rather than to poor overlap geometry and symmetry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2236254"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative principles to quantitative predictions is a key step in mastering a chemical concept.
