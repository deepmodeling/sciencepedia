It is a stable compound that is known to satisfy the 18-electron rule, which is a common guiding principle for the stability of organometallic compounds. To reconcile the electron count with this rule, a specific electron-donating model for the nitrosyl (NO) ligand must be chosen. Considering that cobalt is in Group 9 of the periodic table, which of the following statements accurately describes the electronic structure of this complex?\n\nA. The cobalt center has a formal oxidation state of +1 and a d-electron count of 8.\n\nB. The nitrosyl ligand acts as a one-electron donor, and the Co-N-O bond is expected to be bent.\n\nC. The cobalt center has a formal oxidation state of -1 and a d-electron count of 10.\n\nD. The complex has a total of 16 valence electrons, making it an exception to the 18-electron rule.\n\nE. The nitrosyl ligand is best described as NO⁻, and it contributes 3 electrons.", "solution": "Using the neutral ligand model, a neutral Cobalt atom (Group 9) contributes 9 valence electrons. Carbonyl ligands are neutral 2-electron donors, so three CO ligands contribute $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons. For the nitrosyl ligand, there are two common conventions to reach the 18-electron total stated in the problem:\n-   A **linear** NO is counted as a **3-electron donor**. The total electron count is $9 + 6 + 3 = 18$. This satisfies the 18-electron rule.\n-   A **bent** NO is counted as a **1-electron donor**. The total electron count is $9 + 6 + 1 = 16$. This contradicts the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the complex must adopt a linear nitrosyl model. To find the formal oxidation state, we use the ionic model, in which a linear NO is treated as the nitrosonium cation, $NO^+$ (a 2-electron donor). For the overall complex to be neutral, the metal's oxidation state ($x$) must be -1:\n$$x + 3(0) + (+1) = 0 \\implies x = -1.$$\nA cobalt atom is in Group 9. An oxidation state of -1 gives it a $d$-electron count of $9 - (-1) = 10$.\nChecking the 18-electron count in the ionic model confirms this:\n$$\\text{Total} = d\\text{-electrons} + \\text{ligand donation} = 10 + (3 \\times 2) + 2 = 18.$$\nThus, the correct description is that cobalt is in oxidation state $-1$ with a $d^{10}$ configuration. This matches option C. Options A and B correspond to the 16-electron count. D is explicitly false. E is incorrect as $NO^-$ is a 2-electron donor, not a 3-electron donor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2270279"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models of bonding are powerful, but they are most useful when connected to experimental data. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a key technique for probing the nature of the metal-nitrosyl bond, where the $N-O$ stretching frequency, $\\nu_{NO}$, is highly sensitive to the ligand's electronic environment. This practice [@problem_id:2270231] challenges you to predict how a change in the overall charge of a complex affects metal-to-ligand $\\pi$-backbonding and, consequently, how this electronic change is reflected in the observable $\\nu_{NO}$ frequency.", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, the vibrational frequency of a ligand can provide significant insight into the nature of the metal-ligand bond. The nitrosyl ligand (NO) is particularly sensitive to its electronic environment. Consider the two following pentacyanonitrosylferrate complexes: the nitroprusside anion, $[Fe(CN)_5(NO)]^{2-}$, and its one-electron reduced form, $[Fe(CN)_5(NO)]^{3-}$. The stretching frequency of the nitrogen-oxygen bond ($\\nu_{NO}$) can be measured using Infrared (IR) spectroscopy.\n\nBased on the principles of metal-ligand bonding, which of the following statements correctly predicts the relative $\\nu_{NO}$ stretching frequencies of these two complexes?\n\nA. $[Fe(CN)_5(NO)]^{2-}$ has a higher $\\nu_{NO}$ stretching frequency than $[Fe(CN)_5(NO)]^{3-}$.\n\nB. $[Fe(CN)_5(NO)]^{3-}$ has a higher $\\nu_{NO}$ stretching frequency than $[Fe(CN)_5(NO)]^{2-}$.\n\nC. Both complexes have identical $\\nu_{NO}$ stretching frequencies because the NO ligand is the same.\n\nD. It is impossible to predict the relative order of the $\\nu_{NO}$ stretching frequencies without experimental data.", "solution": "We analyze the N–O stretching frequency using the diatomic oscillator model from IR spectroscopy. The frequency is given by\n$$\n\\nu_{NO} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{NO}}{\\mu_{NO}}},\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light, $k_{NO}$ is the force constant of the N–O bond, and $\\mu_{NO}$ is the reduced mass of the N–O pair.

Therefore, any difference in $\\nu_{NO}$ must arise from a difference in $k_{NO}$.\n\nThe force constant $k_{NO}$ correlates with the N–O bond order: higher bond order implies a larger $k_{NO}$ and thus a higher $\\nu_{NO}$. In metal–nitrosyl complexes, $\\pi$ backbonding from filled metal $d\\pi$ orbitals into the $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals of NO weakens the N–O bond by populating antibonding character, thereby decreasing the bond order and $k_{NO}$, which lowers $\\nu_{NO}$.\n\nComparing the two complexes, the one-electron reduction from $[Fe(CN)_{5}(NO)]^{2-}$ to $[Fe(CN)_{5}(NO)]^{3-}$ increases electron density in the Fe–NO unit.

The significant drop in the nitrosyl stretching frequency upon crystallization indicates a change from a linear Ru-N-O geometry in solution to a bent geometry in the solid state.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most chemically sound explanation for this observed structural and spectroscopic change?\n\nA. The crystal packing forces in the solid state impose severe steric strain on the linear Ru-N-O unit, forcing it to adopt a less sterically demanding bent conformation.\n\nB. The $BF_4^-$ counter-ion in the crystal lattice acts as a one-electron reducing agent, converting the complex from a $\\{RuNO\\}^6$ system in solution to a $\\{RuNO\\}^7$ system in the solid state, which is known to favor a bent geometry.\n\nC. The non-coordinating $CH_2Cl_2$ solvent strongly stabilizes the $Ru(II)-NO^+$ resonance contributor through favorable dipole-ion interactions, enforcing a linear geometry. In the absence of this stabilization in the solid state, the complex relaxes to its intrinsically preferred bent geometry.\n\nD. In the solid state, one of the carbonyl ligands fully dissociates from the ruthenium center, creating a five-coordinate species. This change in coordination number induces the isomerization of the nitrosyl ligand from a linear to a bent form.\n\nE. In the crystal lattice, the oxygen atom of the nitrosyl ligand forms a weak intermolecular dative bond to the ruthenium center of an adjacent complex. This bridging interaction stabilizes the bent $NO^-$ form, leading to a lower N-O bond order.", "solution": "The key spectroscopic observation is that upon going from solution to solid state the nitrosyl stretching frequency drops from $\\nu_{\\text{NO}}=1895\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ to $\\nu_{\\text{NO}}=1680\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, while the carbonyl stretches increase from $\\nu_{\\text{CO}}=2052, 1985\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ to $\\nu_{\\text{CO}}=2068, 2001\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$.

Since $\\mu$ for N–O does not change, a decrease in $\\nu_{\\text{NO}}$ indicates a decrease in the N–O force constant $k$, i.e., a lower N–O bond order. For metal nitrosyls, a lower N–O bond order correlates with increased metal-to-NO $\\pi$ backbonding and a bent M–N–O geometry, whereas a higher N–O bond order correlates with a linear geometry dominated by the $\\text{NO}^{+}$ resonance contributor. This is consistent with the established correlation in the Enemark–Feltham notation: linear $\\{\\text{MNO}\\}^{6}$ species tend to have higher $\\nu_{\\text{NO}}$, while bent, more anionic nitrosyl character is typical of $\\{\\text{MNO}\\}^{7}$-like electronic structures. Even without a formal change in electron count, lattice interactions can stabilize the more anionic nitrosyl resonance contributor and induce bending.\n\nConcomitantly, the increase in $\\nu_{\\text{CO}}$ in the solid state signifies an increase in the C–O force constant $k$, i.e., less M$\\rightarrow$CO backbonding. Because M$\\rightarrow$CO and M$\\rightarrow$NO backbonding often compete for the same metal $\\pi$-electron density, a shift toward stronger M$\\rightarrow$NO backbonding (which lowers $\\nu_{\\text{NO}}$) will typically weaken M$\\rightarrow$CO backbonding (which raises $\\nu_{\\text{CO}}$). The observed pair of changes (NO downshift, CO upshift) therefore self-consistently indicates that in the solid state the nitrosyl accepts more backbonding and adopts a bent geometry with lower N–O bond order.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- D is ruled out directly by the IR data: two distinct $\\nu_{\\text{CO}}$ bands remain in the solid, so a CO ligand has not dissociated.\n- B is chemically unsound: $\\text{BF}_{4}^{-}$ is a nonreducing, weakly coordinating anion and does not act as a one-electron reductant to convert $\\{\\text{RuNO}\\}^{6}$ to $\\{\\text{RuNO}\\}^{7}$ in the crystal.\n- A appeals only to steric packing; however, such steric effects alone are unlikely to drive the large electronic reorganization required to lower $\\nu_{\\text{NO}}$ by over $200\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and simultaneously raise $\\nu_{\\text{CO}}$, which specifically signal changes in backbonding and bond orders.\n- C invokes strong stabilization of a linear $\\text{NO}^{+}$ form by a noncoordinating, modestly polar solvent (CH$_{2}$Cl$_{2}$), which is not a compelling driver for such a pronounced shift; moreover, the solid-state data point to specific interactions that favor the more anionic nitrosyl resonance form.\n- E proposes a weak intermolecular O(NO)$\\rightarrow$Ru dative interaction in the crystal lattice. Such secondary O-bound interactions to a metal center (or analogous strong hydrogen bonding or Lewis acidic contacts at O) are well known to stabilize the more anionic nitrosyl resonance form, increase M$\\rightarrow$NO backbonding, bend the M–N–O unit, and thereby lower $\\nu_{\\text{NO}}$, while diverting electron density away from CO and raising $\\nu_{\\text{CO}}$. This mechanism matches both the geometry change and the coordinated shifts in $\\nu_{\\text{NO}}$ and $\\nu_{\\text{CO}}$.\n\nTherefore, the most chemically sound explanation is that a lattice-stabilized, O-involving intermolecular interaction favors the bent, more anionic nitrosyl form, as described in option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2270277"}]}
