While the metal's properties are crucial, the electronic nature of the alkene itself plays a decisive role in the strength of the ${\\pi}$-back-donation component of the bond. This exercise [@problem_id:2268111] challenges you to think from the ligand's perspective, using your understanding of substituent effects to rank different alkenes by their ability to act as ${\\pi}$-acceptors, a key factor in tuning the properties of these complexes.", "problem": "In inorganic chemistry, the bonding between a transition metal and an alkene is described by the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model. This model involves two main components: first, a σ-donation of electron density from the alkene's filled π-bonding orbital (the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, or HOMO) to an empty d-orbital on the metal; and second, a π-backbonding interaction where electron density is donated from a filled metal d-orbital to the alkene's empty π* antibonding orbital (the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital, or LUMO). The strength of an alkene as a π-acceptor is determined by the ability of its π* orbital to accept this back-donated electron density. A lower energy for the π* orbital generally leads to stronger backbonding and thus greater π-acceptor character.\n\nConsider the following three alkenes:\n1. Ethene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4$)\n2. cis-2-Butene ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}=\\text{CHCH}_3$)\n3.

The π-acceptor strength is directly related to the energy of the alkene's Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), which is the π* antibonding orbital. A lower LUMO energy allows for a better energetic overlap with the filled d-orbitals of the metal, facilitating stronger π-backbonding. We must therefore analyze how the substituents on each alkene affect the energy of its π* orbital.\n\nStep 1: Analyze tetrafluoroethene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{F}_4$).\nFluorine is the most electronegative element. The C-F bonds are highly polar, with fluorine atoms withdrawing electron density from the carbon atoms. This is a strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I effect). This withdrawal of electron density from the carbon-carbon double bond has a profound stabilizing effect on all the molecular orbitals of the π system, including both the filled π (HOMO) and the empty π* (LUMO). By significantly lowering the energy of the π* LUMO, tetrafluoroethene becomes a very effective acceptor of electron density from the metal. Therefore, $\\text{C}_2\\text{F}_4$ is expected to be a strong π-acceptor.\n\nStep 2: Analyze ethene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4$).\nEthene is the simplest alkene, with only hydrogen atoms as substituents. The C-H bond has very low polarity, and hydrogen is generally considered to have a negligible inductive effect compared to alkyl or halogen substituents. Thus, ethene serves as a neutral benchmark against which the other two substituted alkenes can be compared.\n\nStep 3: Analyze cis-2-butene ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}=\\text{CHCH}_3$).\nThis alkene has two methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$) groups attached to the C=C double bond. Alkyl groups, such as methyl, are known to be electron-donating groups. They exhibit a positive inductive effect (+I effect), pushing electron density towards the double bond. This donation of electron density has a destabilizing effect on the π* orbital, raising its energy. A higher-energy LUMO results in a poorer energetic match with the metal's d-orbitals, making it more difficult for the alkene to accept back-donated electrons. Consequently, cis-2-butene is expected to be a weak π-acceptor.\n\nStep 4: Synthesize the final ranking.\nWe compare the LUMO energies of the three alkenes based on the electronic effects of their substituents:\n- Tetrafluoroethene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{F}_4$): Strong electron-withdrawing F groups → Lowest energy LUMO.\n- Ethene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4$): No significant electronic effects from H atoms → Intermediate energy LUMO.\n- cis-2-Butene: Electron-donating $\\text{CH}_3$ groups → Highest energy LUMO.\n\nSince π-acceptor strength is inversely related to the LUMO energy, the order from strongest π-acceptor to weakest π-acceptor is:\ntetrafluoroethene > ethene > cis-2-butene.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2268111"}, {"introduction": "The beauty of the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model lies in its ability to explain a continuum of bonding, from weak association to profound structural transformation. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2268157] invites you to consider the extreme case of exceptionally strong ${\\pi}$-back-donation, a scenario with dramatic and observable consequences. By connecting spectroscopic data to molecular geometry, you will see how the familiar planar alkene can distort into a fundamentally different structure—best described as a metallocyclopropane—pushing the simple model to its insightful limit.", "problem": "A research group synthesizes a new zero-valent transition metal complex that incorporates a single ethylene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4$) ligand. To probe the nature of the metal-ethylene bond, they perform Infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The analysis reveals that the stretching frequency corresponding to the C-C bond in the coordinated ethylene is found at a significantly lower wavenumber than in free ethylene, a value which is more characteristic of a C-C single bond than a C-C double bond. Further computational and spectroscopic studies confirm that this observation is due to exceptionally strong electron back-donation from a filled d-orbital on the metal into the ethylene's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), while the sigma-donation from ethylene's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the metal is comparatively weak.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the geometry of the coordinated ethylene fragment within the complex?\n\nA. The ethylene fragment remains planar, with C-C and C-H bond lengths nearly identical to those in free, uncoordinated ethylene. The H-C-H angles are approximately 120°.\nB. The ethylene fragment remains planar, but the C-C bond is significantly elongated. The four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms all lie in the same plane.\nC. The C-C bond is elongated, and the fragment becomes non-planar, with the four hydrogen atoms bending away from the metal center. The overall geometry resembles a fragment of a boat-conformation cyclohexane.\nD. The geometry is best described as a metallocyclopropane. The C-C bond order approaches one, the hybridization of the carbon atoms shifts towards sp³, and the hydrogen atoms bend significantly out of the original ethylene plane, away from the metal.\nE. The C-C bond is significantly shortened due to the geometric constraints of coordination, and the four hydrogen atoms are bent towards the metal center to maximize orbital overlap.", "solution": "We identify the bonding using the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model, which comprises two interactions between an alkene and a metal: (i) donation from the alkene HOMO (the C=C $\\pi$ bond) into a metal acceptor orbital, and (ii) back-donation from a filled metal $d$ orbital into the alkene LUMO (the C=C $\\pi^{*}$). The problem states that back-donation is exceptionally strong while $\\pi$-donation from ethylene to the metal is comparatively weak.\n\nInfrared evidence: The observed C–C stretching frequency in the coordinated ethylene is shifted to significantly lower wavenumber than in free ethylene. By Hooke’s law for a diatomic-like vibration,\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}},\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is the wavenumber, $k$ is the force constant for the C–C bond, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two carbons. A lower $\\tilde{\\nu}$ implies a smaller $k$, i.e., a weaker C–C bond. Population of the $\\pi^{*}$ orbital by strong back-donation reduces the C–C bond order; symbolically, if $x$ electrons occupy the $\\pi^{*}$ orbital due to back-donation, the nominal C–C bond order decreases from $2$ toward $2-\\frac{x}{2}$, approaching $1$ as $x$ approaches $2$. This explains both the weakened (lower $k$) and elongated C–C bond and the IR shift toward a value characteristic of a C–C single bond.\n\nGeometric consequence of dominant back-donation with weak $\\pi$-donation: Occupancy of the alkene $\\pi^{*}$ orbital induces pyramidalization at the carbon atoms, shifting their hybridization from $sp^{2}$ toward $sp^{3}$ and bending the hydrogen substituents out of the original ethylene plane. This creates substantial M–C $\\sigma$ character formed from the carbon $sp^{3}$-like lone-pair directionality, and the best structural description becomes a metallocyclopropane: a three-membered M–C–C ring with a C–C bond order near one, non-planar carbons, and hydrogens bent away from the metal center. This is the established limit of the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson continuum when back-donation dominates.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incompatible with the strong back-donation: the C–C bond is not retained at the typical double-bond length or force constant; planarity and $120^{\\circ}$ H–C–H angles are not preserved.\n- B keeps the fragment planar despite a significantly elongated C–C bond; strong back-donation induces pyramidalization at carbon, so strict planarity is not maintained.\n- C captures non-planarity and hydrogens bending away from the metal but describes the shape as resembling a boat-conformation fragment, which is not the standard or most accurate description for this bonding regime.\n- D correctly states the metallocyclopropane description, the approach of the C–C bond order to one, the shift toward $sp^{3}$ hybridization at carbon, and significant out-of-plane bending of hydrogens away from the metal.\n- E contradicts the IR and bonding analysis by asserting C–C shortening and hydrogens bending toward the metal; strong back-donation lengthens and weakens the C–C bond and causes pyramidalization away from the metal.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the geometry is best described as a metallocyclopropane with $sp^{3}$-like carbons, elongated C–C bond, and hydrogens bent away from the metal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2268157"}]}
