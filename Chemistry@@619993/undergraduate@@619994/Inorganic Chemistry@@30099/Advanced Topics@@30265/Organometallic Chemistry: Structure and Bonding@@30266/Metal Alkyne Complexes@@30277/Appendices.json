In $W(\\text{CO})_x(\\text{HC}\\equiv\\text{CH})$, both $CO$ and $\\eta^{2}$-coordinated acetylene are neutral $L$-type ligands. Since the overall complex is neutral and all ligands are neutral, the tungsten oxidation state is\n$$\\text{OS}(W)=0.$$\n\nThe group number of tungsten is $6$, so its $d$-electron count in oxidation state zero is\n$$d\\text{-electron count} = 6 - 0 = 6.$$\n\nNext, count ligand electron donation:\n- Each $CO$ donates $2$ electrons, contributing $2x$ electrons in total.\n- A terminal $\\eta^{2}$-acetylene donates $2$ electrons.\n\nHence, the total electron count at tungsten is\n$$N_{e} = 6 + 2x + 2.$$\n\nFor 18-electron stability, set\n$$6 + 2x + 2 = 18.$$\nRearranging gives\n$$2x + 8 = 18 \\implies 2x = 10 \\implies x = 5.$$\n\nTherefore, the integer $x$ required for an 18-electron, and thus typically stable, complex is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "2268704"}, {"introduction": "While the 18-electron rule provides a target, the way a complex achieves it reveals deeper insights into its bonding.

This rule suggests that diamagnetic, stable complexes are often formed when the sum of the metal's d-electrons and the electrons supplied by the ligands equals 18.\n\nConsider the titanocene-alkyne complex with the chemical formula $(Cp)_2Ti(\\text{CH}_3\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{C}\\text{CH}_3)$. In this formula, Cp represents the cyclopentadienyl ligand ($\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_5$). Alkynes, such as the but-2-yne ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{C}\\text{CH}_3$) ligand in this complex, are known to be versatile and can bond to a metal center as either a 2-electron donor or a 4-electron donor.\n\nTo achieve a stable 18-electron configuration for the complex $(Cp)_2Ti(\\text{CH}_3\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{C}\\text{CH}_3)$, how must the but-2-yne ligand function?\n\nA.

Each cyclopentadienyl ligand is $Cp^{-}$ (charge $-1$), and the alkyne is neutral. Let the oxidation state of Ti be $x$. For a neutral complex,\n$$x+(-1)+(-1)+0=0 \\implies x=+2.$$\n\n2) Compute the metal d-electron count. Titanium is in group $4$, so for $Ti^{+2}$ the d-electron count is\n$$d^{n}, \\quad n=\\text{group number}-\\text{oxidation state}=4-2=2.$$\n\n3) Count ligand electron donations.

A target compound is a neutral, square planar platinum(II) complex with the molecular formula $[\\text{PtBrCl}(\\text{PhC}\\equiv\\text{CPh})(\\text{NH}_3)]$.

The alkyne ligand is symmetric (both ends are phenyl-substituted) and behaves as a neutral two-electron donor occupying one site, so it can be treated as a single, distinct monodentate ligand for stereochemical counting. There is no linkage isomerism for these ligands, and with a planar coordination environment, mirror images are superimposable; thus no optical isomerism arises.\n\nFor a square planar complex with four different ligands $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, geometric isomers are uniquely specified by which ligands are trans to each other, because rotations and reflections in the plane can permute cis adjacencies but do not change trans relationships.
