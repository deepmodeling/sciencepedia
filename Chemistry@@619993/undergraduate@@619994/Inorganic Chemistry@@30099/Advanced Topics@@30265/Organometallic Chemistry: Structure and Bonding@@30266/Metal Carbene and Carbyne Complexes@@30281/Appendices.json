The goal is to prepare a neutral complex that contains a single iron (Fe) atom, multiple carbonyl (CO) ligands, and exactly one Schrock-type carbene ligand, specifically the methylene ligand ($=CH_2$). For the complex to be considered stable, it must adhere to the 18-electron rule.

We will use the ionic model for electron counting, which is particularly effective for distinguishing between different ligand types, such as Schrock and Fischer carbenes.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the formal oxidation state of the iron center.**\nThe overall complex is neutral. We must assign formal charges to the ligands to deduce the oxidation state of the central metal atom.\n- The carbonyl ligand, CO, is a neutral molecule and is treated as a neutral ligand with a formal charge of 0.\n- The Schrock-type carbene, methylene ($=CH_2$), is formally treated as a dianion, $[CH_2]^{2-}$. This is because it forms a double bond with the metal, and in the ionic model, we assign the electrons of this bond to the more electronegative atom (carbon).\n\nThe sum of the formal charges must equal the overall charge of the complex, which is zero.\n$$(\\text{Oxidation State of Fe}) + n \\times (\\text{Charge of CO}) + (\\text{Charge of } =CH_2) = 0$$\n$$(\\text{Oxidation State of Fe}) + n \\times (0) + (-2) = 0$$\n$$(\\text{Oxidation State of Fe}) = +2$$\nThus, the iron atom is in the +2 oxidation state, denoted as Fe(II).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the valence electron contribution from the metal center.**\nA neutral iron (Fe) atom is in Group 8 of the periodic table, so it has 8 valence electrons. To find the electron count for the Fe(II) ion, we subtract the oxidation state from the group number:\n$$(\\text{Electrons from Fe(II)}) = (\\text{Group number}) - (\\text{Oxidation State})$$\n$$(\\text{Electrons from Fe(II)}) = 8 - 2 = 6$$\nSo, the Fe(II) center contributes 6 electrons to the complex's total valence electron count.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the electron contribution from the ligands.**\n- Each neutral carbonyl (CO) ligand is a 2-electron donor. Therefore, $n$ CO ligands contribute a total of $2n$ electrons.\n- The dianionic Schrock carbene ligand, $[CH_2]^{2-}$, is considered a 4-electron donor in the ionic model.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the 18-electron rule to solve for n.**\nThe total number of valence electrons in a stable complex is 18.

It donates 5 electrons.\nCp contribution = 5 e⁻.\n- Each carbonyl (CO) ligand is a neutral molecule and acts as a 2-electron donor. Since there are two CO ligands on each metal, their total contribution is $2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons.\n2 CO contribution = 4 e⁻.\n\nStep 3: Electron contribution from the metal-metal bond.\nThe problem states there is a direct Mo-Mo single bond.

The problem specifies that this bridging ligand acts as a 4-electron donor to the entire dimetal core. Since the bridge is symmetric, these 4 electrons are shared equally between the two Mo centers. Therefore, the contribution to a single Mo center is half of the total.\n$\\mu-CPh$ contribution per Mo = $\\frac{4}{2}$ e⁻ = 2 e⁻.\n\nStep 5: Summing the contributions.\nNow, we sum all the electron contributions for one molybdenum center to find its total valence electron count.\nTotal e⁻ count per Mo = (e⁻ from Mo) + (e⁻ from Cp) + (e⁻ from 2 CO) + (e⁻ from Mo-Mo bond) + (e⁻ from $\\mu-CPh$ bridge)\nTotal e⁻ count per Mo = $6 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 2$\nTotal e⁻ count per Mo = $18$\n\nThus, the total valence electron count for a single molybdenum center in the complex is 18.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18}$$", "id": "2268967"}]}
