Two fragments are considered isolobal if they require the same number of electrons to achieve their respective stable electron configurations. For a main group element fragment, the stable configuration is an octet (8 electrons), while for a transition metal fragment, it is typically governed by the 18-electron rule.\n\nConsider a neutral boron monohydride fragment, $BH$, and a dicarbonylcobalt fragment represented as $[Co(CO)_2]^q$. Your task is to determine the integer charge, $q$, that must be present on the cobalt fragment for it to be isolobal with the neutral $BH$ fragment.\n\nFor your calculations, use the following information:\n- Boron (B) is a Group 13 element.\n- Cobalt (Co) is a Group 9 element.\n- A hydrogen atom (H) ligand contributes 1 electron.\n- A carbonyl (CO) ligand is a neutral ligand that contributes 2 electrons.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of electrons the neutral boron monohydride ($BH$) fragment needs to achieve a stable electron count. Then, we will set up an expression for the number of electrons needed by the dicarbonylcobalt ($[Co(CO)_2]^q$) fragment and equate the two to find the required charge, $q$.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the main group fragment, $BH$.\nThe stable electron count for a main group fragment is 8 (the octet rule). We first calculate the total number of valence electrons (VE) in the neutral $BH$ fragment.\n- Boron (B) is in Group 13, so it contributes 3 valence electrons.\n- The hydrogen (H) ligand contributes 1 valence electron.\nThe total number of valence electrons for the $BH$ fragment is:\n$$VE_{\\text{BH}} = (\\text{electrons from B}) + (\\text{electrons from H}) = 3 + 1 = 4$$\nThe number of electrons needed for the $BH$ fragment to reach a stable octet is:\n$$Electrons\\_Needed_{\\text{BH}} = 8 - VE_{\\text{BH}} = 8 - 4 = 4$$\n\nStep 2: Analyze the transition metal fragment, $[Co(CO)_2]^q$.\nThe stable electron count for a transition metal fragment is 18 (the 18-electron rule). We need to write an expression for the total number of valence electrons in the $[Co(CO)_2]^q$ fragment in terms of the unknown charge, $q$.\n- Cobalt (Co) is in Group 9, so it contributes 9 valence electrons.\n- There are two carbonyl (CO) ligands, and each is a neutral 2-electron donor. So, the ligands contribute $2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons.\n- The overall charge of the fragment is $q$. A positive charge corresponds to a loss of electrons, so we subtract $q$ from the total count.\nThe total number of valence electrons for the $[Co(CO)_2]^q$ fragment is:\n$$VE_{\\text{Co}} = (\\text{electrons from Co}) + (\\text{electrons from 2 CO}) - q = 9 + 4 - q = 13 - q$$\nThe number of electrons needed for this fragment to reach a stable 18-electron configuration is:\n$$Electrons\\_Needed_{\\text{Co}} = 18 - VE_{\\text{Co}} = 18 - (13 - q)$$\n\nStep 3: Apply the isolobal condition and solve for $q$.\nThe isolobal analogy requires that the two fragments need the same number of electrons to achieve their respective stable configurations.

This problem challenges you to bridge the gap between organometallic and main group chemistry by identifying a simple main group hydride that is isolobal to a given organometallic cation.

It allows chemists to predict structural similarities and reactivity patterns by identifying fragments with analogous frontier molecular orbitals. A practical and widely used rule for establishing this analogy is based on electron counting: a transition metal (TM) fragment with $N_{TM}$ total valence electrons is considered isolobal with a main group (MG) fragment having $N_{MG}$ total valence electrons if they both lack the same number of electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration (18 for the TM fragment, 8 for the MG fragment).\n\nUsing this principle, determine a simple, neutral main group hydride fragment, represented by the general formula $EH_n$ where $E$ is a main group element, that is isolobal with the cationic organometallic fragment $[Re(CO)_5]^+$.

In this final practice, you will apply the analogy to forecast the outcome of a chemical reaction and determine the geometry of the resulting product.

Two fragments are considered isolobal if their frontier molecular orbitals—the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals—are similar in symmetry, approximate energy, and electron occupation. A practical consequence is that isolobal fragments often exhibit similar chemical reactivity.\n\nConsider the cationic organometallic fragment, pentacarbonylmanganese(I), which has the formula $[Mn(CO)_5]^+$. This fragment is known to be isolobal to the simple main-group molecule borane, $BH_3$. Both species act as potent Lewis acids.

The reaction adds an $X$-type hydride ligand to the 16-electron, five-coordinate fragment to yield the neutral hydride complex:\n$$[Mn(CO)_5]^{+} + H^{-} \\to HMn(CO)_5.$$\n\nFirst, determine the metal oxidation state in the product by charge balance. Let $x$ be the oxidation state of Mn in $HMn(CO)_5$. Using that $CO$ is an $L$-type neutral donor with charge $0$ and $H$ is $H^{-}$ with charge $-1$, and the overall complex is neutral,\n$$x + \\left(5 \\times 0\\right) + (-1) = 0 \\implies x = +1.$$\nThus Mn is in the $+1$ oxidation state, so it is a $d^{6}$ center because Mn is in group $7$, and $d = 7 - 1 = 6$.\n\nNext, compute the valence electron count using the ionic method. Each $CO$ donates $2$ electrons as an $L$-type ligand, and $H^{-}$ donates $2$ electrons as an $X$-type ligand. Therefore,\n$$n_{e^{-}} = d + \\sum L + \\sum X = (7 - 1) + 5 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 2 = 6 + 10 + 2 = 18.$$\nThe product is an $18$-electron complex, consistent with the $18$-electron rule for stability.\n\nThe coordination number is the total number of donor atoms bound to Mn:\n$$N_{\\text{coord}} = 5 \\;(\\text{from }CO) + 1 \\;(\\text{from }H) = 6.$$\nFor six-coordinate transition-metal complexes, the overwhelmingly favored geometry—especially for low-spin $d^{6}$ carbonyl and hydride complexes—is octahedral, due to maximal ligand field stabilization and efficient packing of six ligands. Alternative six-coordinate geometries such as trigonal prismatic are rare for such ligands and electronic configurations. By contrast, the other listed geometries correspond to different coordination numbers or electronic preferences: tetrahedral is typically four-coordinate, square planar is characteristic of $d^{8}$, and trigonal bipyramidal is five-coordinate.\n\nTherefore, the coordination geometry around Mn in $HMn(CO)_5$ is octahedral. This conclusion is also consistent with the isolobal analogy: just as $BH_{3} + H^{-} \\to BH_{4}^{-}$ increases coordination number by one to reach a favored geometry (tetrahedral for four-coordinate), adding $H^{-}$ to $[Mn(CO)_5]^{+}$ increases the coordination number to six, yielding the favored octahedral geometry for an $18$-electron $d^{6}$ Mn(I) carbonyl hydride.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2263012"}]}
