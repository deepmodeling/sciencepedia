This requires us to first determine all reactants and products, then write and balance the chemical equation.\n\nStep 1: Identify the reactants and products.\nThe reactants are given as zinc chloride, $ZnCl_2$, and an \"appropriate alkyllithium reagent\".\nThe target product is diethylzinc, $Zn(C_2H_5)_2$. The name \"diethyl\" and the formula indicate that the alkyl group involved is the ethyl group, $C_2H_5$.\nTherefore, the appropriate alkyllithium reagent must be ethyllithium, which has the formula $LiC_2H_5$.\n\nThe reaction is a salt metathesis, which is a double displacement reaction.

To determine the products, we must analyze the nature of the chemical bonds in the reactants.\n\nIn triethylaluminium, there are three aluminium-carbon (Al-C) bonds. Aluminium is an electropositive metal with a Pauling electronegativity of approximately 1.61, while carbon has an electronegativity of about 2.55. This significant difference in electronegativity leads to a highly polar covalent Al-C bond. The electron density is polarized towards the carbon atom, giving it a substantial partial negative charge ($C^{\\delta-}$) and making it a powerful nucleophile and, more relevantly here, a strong base. The ethyl group in this context can be considered to have carbanionic character ($C_2H_5^-$).\n\nWater ($H_2O$) is a protic molecule that can act as a proton ($H^+$) donor.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as an acid-base reaction, where the strongly basic ethyl group of triethylaluminium abstracts a proton from a water molecule. This type of reaction involving the cleavage of a bond by a proton is known as protonolysis.\n\nFor each Al-C bond that is cleaved, one molecule of water is consumed. The ethyl group is protonated to form the organic product, ethane ($C_2H_6$).\n$$C_2H_5^- \\text{ (from } Al(C_2H_5)_3) + H_2O \\rightarrow C_2H_6 + OH^-$$\n\nThe hydroxide ion ($OH^-$) generated from water then bonds to the electron-deficient aluminium center.

The organic product is ethane ($C_2H_6$), and the inorganic product is aluminium(III) hydroxide ($Al(OH)_3$).\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\n- A. Ethylene and Aluminium(III) oxide are incorrect. Ethylene would result from an elimination reaction, and aluminium oxide would require subsequent dehydration of the hydroxide.\n- B. Ethane and Aluminium(III) hydroxide are the correct products as derived.\n- C. Ethanol and elemental Aluminium are incorrect. This would imply an incorrect reaction pathway where hydroxide acts as a nucleophile on carbon and aluminium is reduced.\n- D. Diethyl ether and Aluminium(III) hydride are incorrect. There is no plausible mechanism for their formation in this reaction.\n- E. Butane and Aluminium(III) hydroxide are incorrect. Butane might form via coupling reactions, which are not characteristic of hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct products of the complete hydrolysis of triethylaluminium are ethane and aluminium(III) hydroxide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2268426"}, {"introduction": "The three-dimensional arrangement of ligands around a metal center can give rise to isomers, which are distinct molecules with the same formula but different structures and properties.

Therefore, the two phosphorus nuclei are chemically and magnetically equivalent. Consequently, only one $^{31}P$ resonance is observed for the trans isomer.\n\nFor the cis isomer, the two $PEt_{3}$ ligands are adjacent.
