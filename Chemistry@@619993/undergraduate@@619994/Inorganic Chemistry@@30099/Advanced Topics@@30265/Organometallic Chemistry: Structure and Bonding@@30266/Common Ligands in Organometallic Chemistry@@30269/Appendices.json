Successfully determining the correct number of ligands requires you to consider how the electrons in the $Mn-Mn$ bond are partitioned, providing a crucial step towards analyzing more intricate organometallic frameworks.", "problem": "In transition metal chemistry, a common heuristic for predicting the stability of organometallic compounds is the 18-electron rule, which states that stable complexes often have a total of 18 valence electrons associated with the metal center. Consider a binuclear metal carbonyl complex with the chemical formula $Mn_2(CO)_n$. The structure of this complex is known to be symmetric, featuring a single covalent bond between the two manganese (Mn) atoms. All carbonyl (CO) ligands are terminal, meaning each CO is bonded to only one Mn atom, and they are distributed equally between the two metal centers.\n\nTo apply the 18-electron rule to this dimeric complex, we consider each metal center individually. Determine the integer value of $n$, the total number of carbonyl ligands in the entire complex, that allows each manganese center to satisfy the 18-electron rule.", "solution": "To satisfy the 18-electron rule for the dimeric complex, we consider each manganese center individually. The total number of electrons around one Mn atom must be 18.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of CO ligands attached to each Mn atom. Since the ligands are distributed equally, the total number of CO ligands in the complex is $n = 2x$.\n\nThe electron count for one Mn center is determined as follows:\n- From the manganese atom (Group 7): 7 valence electrons.\n- From the single Mn-Mn covalent bond: 1 electron.\n- From the $x$ terminal CO ligands (each a 2-electron donor): $2x$ electrons.\n\nSumming these contributions and setting the total to 18 gives the equation:\n$$\n7 (\\text{from Mn}) + 1 (\\text{from Mn-Mn bond}) + 2x (\\text{from COs}) = 18\n$$\nSolving for $x$:\n$$\n8 + 2x = 18 \\\\\n2x = 10 \\\\\nx = 5\n$$\nSo, there are 5 CO ligands on each Mn atom.
