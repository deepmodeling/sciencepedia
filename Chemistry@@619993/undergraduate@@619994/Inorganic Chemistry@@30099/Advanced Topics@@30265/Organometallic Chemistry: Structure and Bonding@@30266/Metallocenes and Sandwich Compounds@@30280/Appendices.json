The electronic structure and, consequently, the physical properties of these compounds are highly dependent on the identity of the central metal atom.

Based on the principles of electron counting and molecular orbital theory for organometallic complexes, determine the expected magnetic behavior (paramagnetic or diamagnetic) for each of these compounds at room temperature.\n\nFor the purpose of electron counting, treat the cyclopentadienyl ligand (Cp) as the cyclopentadienyl anion (Cp⁻).

Ferrocene is diamagnetic, and vanadocene is diamagnetic.", "solution": "The magnetic property of a compound is determined by the presence of unpaired electrons. A compound with one or more unpaired electrons is paramagnetic, while a compound with all electrons paired is diamagnetic. For organometallic complexes like metallocenes, we can predict the number of unpaired electrons by determining the total valence electron count and considering how these electrons fill the molecular orbitals (MOs) of the complex.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Ferrocene, $Fe(Cp)_2$**\n\nFirst, we determine the oxidation state of the iron (Fe) center. The cyclopentadienyl ligand is treated as the anion, $Cp^-$, which has a charge of -1. Since the overall complex $Fe(Cp)_2$ is neutral, the iron atom must have an oxidation state of +2 to balance the charge of the two $Cp^-$ ligands. So, we have Fe(II) or $Fe^{2+}$.\n\nNext, we find the d-electron count of the $Fe^{2+}$ ion. A neutral iron atom (Group 8) has the electron configuration $\\text{[Ar] } 3d^6 4s^2$. To form the $Fe^{2+}$ ion, it loses the two 4s electrons, leaving an electron configuration of $\\text{[Ar] } 3d^6$. Thus, $Fe^{2+}$ is a $d^6$ metal center.\n\nNow, we calculate the total valence electron count for the ferrocene complex. The $Fe^{2+}$ ion contributes 6 valence electrons. Each $Cp^-$ ligand is a 6-electron donor.\nTotal valence electrons = (electrons from $Fe^{2+}$) + 2 × (electrons from $Cp^-$)\nTotal valence electrons = 6 + 2 × 6 = 18 electrons.\n\nA total count of 18 valence electrons corresponds to a filled valence shell for an organometallic complex, analogous to the octet rule for main group elements. In the molecular orbital diagram for ferrocene, the 18 electrons completely fill the bonding and non-bonding orbitals. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) are a degenerate pair ($e_{2g}$) which are fully occupied. There are no unpaired electrons in the ground state. Therefore, ferrocene is diamagnetic.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Vanadocene, $V(Cp)_2$**\n\nFollowing the same procedure, we determine the oxidation state of the vanadium (V) center. With two $Cp^-$ ligands, the vanadium atom must have an oxidation state of +2 to ensure the complex is neutral. So, we have V(II) or $V^{2+}$.\n\nNext, we find the d-electron count of the $V^{2+}$ ion. A neutral vanadium atom (Group 5) has the electron configuration $\\text{[Ar] } 3d^3 4s^2$. To form the $V^{2+}$ ion, it loses the two 4s electrons, leaving an electron configuration of $\\text{[Ar] } 3d^3$. Thus, $V^{2+}$ is a $d^3$ metal center.\n\nNow, we calculate the total valence electron count for the vanadocene complex. The $V^{2+}$ ion contributes 3 valence electrons. Each $Cp^-$ ligand is a 6-electron donor.\nTotal valence electrons = (electrons from $V^{2+}$) + 2 × (electrons from $Cp^-$)\nTotal valence electrons = 3 + 2 × 6 = 15 electrons.\n\nA total of 15 electrons means the complex has an open-shell configuration. These 15 electrons will fill the molecular orbitals. The three valence d-electrons from the metal occupy the frontier molecular orbitals, which for a standard metallocene are the $a'_{1g}$ and the degenerate $e_{2g}$ orbitals. According to Hund's rule, electrons will singly occupy degenerate orbitals before pairing up. The three electrons will therefore occupy these orbitals, resulting in an electronic configuration of $(a'_{1g})^1(e_{2g})^2$. This leaves three unpaired electrons. The presence of unpaired electrons makes the compound paramagnetic. Therefore, vanadocene is paramagnetic.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n- Ferrocene has 18 valence electrons, all of which are paired. It is diamagnetic.\n- Vanadocene has 15 valence electrons, resulting in 3 unpaired electrons. It is paramagnetic.\n\nThis corresponds to the statement: \"Ferrocene is diamagnetic, and vanadocene is paramagnetic.\"\n\nComparing this with the given options, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2271085"}]}
