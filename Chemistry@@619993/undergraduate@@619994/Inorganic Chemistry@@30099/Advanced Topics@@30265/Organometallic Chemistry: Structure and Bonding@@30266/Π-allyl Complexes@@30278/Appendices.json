The overall complex is electrically neutral.\n\nDetermine the formal oxidation state of the molybdenum center and its corresponding d-electron count. Provide the two integer values in the order: (formal oxidation state, d-electron count).", "solution": "Let the formal oxidation state of Mo be $x$. Assign formal charges to the ligands using standard oxidation-state conventions:\n- $Cp$ is $C_{5}H_{5}^{-}$, so it contributes $-1$.\n- Each $CO$ is neutral, so each contributes $0$.\n- The $\\eta^{3}$-allyl ligand is the $\\pi$-allyl anion $C_{3}H_{5}^{-}$, so it contributes $-1$.\n\nThe complex is neutral, so the sum of the metal oxidation state and ligand charges is zero:\n$$x+(-1)+2\\cdot 0+(-1)=0 \\implies x-2=0 \\implies x=+2.$$\n\nThe $d$-electron count for the metal center is given by the group number minus the oxidation state.

Across both ligands, there are $10$ protons: $2$ central $CH$ protons and $8$ terminal $CH_{2}$ protons.\n\nAt sufficiently high temperature, rapid fluxional motion interconverts the syn and anti protons on each terminal $CH_{2}$, so on the NMR timescale the two protons on a given terminal carbon become equivalent and give a single averaged environment. By symmetry of the $\\eta^{3}$-allyl ligand in this complex and the stated equivalence of the two ligands, the two terminal $CH_{2}$ groups within a ligand are equivalent, and the terminal groups across both ligands are mutually equivalent. Therefore, all terminal protons together form one set of equivalent protons. The two central $CH$ protons (one on each ligand) are also equivalent to each other and distinct from the terminal protons, forming a second set.\n\nThus, there are $2$ distinct proton signals: one for the two equivalent central $CH$ protons and one for the eight equivalent terminal protons.

Engaging in this thought experiment will sharpen your ability to connect molecular motion to experimental design and interpret its results, a skill at the heart of modern chemical discovery.", "problem": "An organometallic chemist synthesizes a complex, denoted as **Z**, which contains a single $\\eta^3$-allyl ligand, $(\\eta^3-C_3H_5)$. The allyl ligand's carbons are labeled C1, C2, and C3. The protons attached to the terminal carbons, C1 and C3, are categorized as either *syn* (on the same side of the C1-C3 vector as the central C2 proton) or *anti* (on the opposite side).\n\nA specific isotopologue of complex **Z** is prepared where a single deuterium (D) atom replaces the proton at the C1-*syn* position. At a sufficiently high temperature, variable-temperature Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy reveals that a dynamic process is occurring, leading to the exchange of the deuterium label with the other terminal proton sites.\n\nTwo primary mechanisms are proposed for this exchange:\n\n- **Mechanism I**: A reversible transformation between the $\\eta^3$-allyl and an $\\eta^1$-allyl intermediate. In this pathway, the metal detaches from two of the carbons to form a $\\sigma$-bond with a terminal carbon (e.g., C1 or C3). This intermediate allows for C-C single bond rotation and subsequent re-formation of the $\\eta^3$ complex, potentially scrambling all terminal positions.\n- **Mechanism II**: A rigid rotation of the entire $\\eta^3$-allyl ligand as a single unit around an axis that passes through the metal atom and the midpoint of the allyl ligand.\n\nAssuming the dynamic process observed for complex **Z** proceeds exclusively via **Mechanism II** (rigid allyl rotation), which of the following statements correctly describes the final distribution of the deuterium label after the system has reached equilibrium?\n\nA.

The deuterium label will be found statistically distributed between the C1-*anti* and C3-*anti* positions only.", "solution": "We label the four terminal positions as states based on carbon (C1 or C3) and orientation (syn or anti) relative to the C2–H: \nS1 = C1–syn, S2 = C1–anti, S3 = C3–syn, S4 = C3–anti. The initial isotopologue has D at S1.\n\nMechanism II is defined as rigid rotation of the entire $\\eta^{3}$-allyl ligand as a single unit about the axis passing through the metal and the allyl midpoint. This motion preserves all internal geometrical relationships within the allyl fragment (no C–C bond rotation, no inversion of the allyl plane), and only reorients the entire allyl relative to the metal.\n\nUnder this rigid body rotation, the two terminal carbons are exchanged, while the syn/anti designation, being defined purely by the internal geometry of the allyl (relative to the C2–H and the C1–C3 vector), is preserved. Therefore, the symmetry operation induced by a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about the M–centroid axis is the permutation\n$$\nR_{\\pi}:\\quad S1 \\leftrightarrow S3,\\quad S2 \\leftrightarrow S4.\n$$\nCrucially, there is no operation in Mechanism II that maps syn to anti or vice versa: transitions $S1 \\leftrightarrow S2$ or $S3 \\leftrightarrow S4$ require internal bond rotation or allyl-face inversion, which do not occur in a rigid rotation.\n\nStarting from $S1$, the closure of accessible states under repeated applications of $R_{\\pi}$ is $\\{S1, S3\\}$. By the symmetry of the $\\eta^{3}$-allyl coordination, C1 and C3 are equivalent, so the free energies of $S1$ and $S3$ are equal. At equilibrium, the deuterium label is therefore statistically distributed only between the two accessible, degenerate states:\n$$\nS1 \\text{ (C1–syn)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S3 \\text{ (C3–syn)}.\n$$\nThe anti positions $S2$ and $S4$ are not populated via this mechanism.\n\nHence, the correct statement is that the label is distributed between the C1–syn and C3–syn positions only.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2300655"}]}
