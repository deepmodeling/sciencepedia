This exercise utilizes the Covalent Bond Classification (CBC) method, a powerful framework for electron counting, to classify a cyclopentadienyl ligand in its simplest $\\eta^1$ binding mode. By working through this problem, you will learn to distinguish between X-type (one-electron radical) and L-type (two-electron neutral) ligands, a fundamental skill for predicting reactivity and stability in organometallic complexes [@problem_id:2256635].", "problem": "In the Covalent Bond Classification (CBC) method for electron counting in organometallic chemistry, ligands are categorized based on how their bonds to the metal center are conceptually cleaved. L-type ligands are considered neutral, 2-electron donors, akin to Lewis bases, which can be dissociated from the metal as stable, neutral molecules. X-type ligands are 1-electron donors (as radicals), and are conceptually generated by the homolytic cleavage of the metal-ligand bond to form a ligand radical. Z-type ligands are neutral, 2-electron acceptors, acting as Lewis acids.\n\nConsider a cyclopentadienyl ligand ($C_5H_5$) that is bound to a metal center through only one of its carbon atoms, a binding mode denoted as monohapto or $\\eta^1$.\n\nBased on the Covalent Bond Classification method, how should the $\\eta^1$-cyclopentadienyl ligand be classified?\n\nA. X-type ligand\n\nB. L-type ligand\n\nC. Both an L-type and an X-type ligand\n\nD. Z-type ligand", "solution": "In the Covalent Bond Classification method, an X-type ligand is defined as a fragment that, upon homolytic cleavage of the metal–ligand bond, departs as a neutral radical, contributing one electron to the M–L bond in the covalent picture. An L-type ligand is a neutral, 2-electron donor that would dissociate as a neutral, closed-shell molecule, while a Z-type ligand is a neutral, 2-electron acceptor.\n\nFor an $\\eta^1$-cyclopentadienyl ligand, the metal is bound through a single carbon atom, giving a sigma-type M–C bond analogous to an alkyl or aryl ligand. Considering homolytic cleavage of this single M–C bond gives\n$$\n\\mathrm{M{-}\\eta^{1}\\!-\\!C_{5}H_{5}} \\xrightarrow{\\text{homolysis}} \\mathrm{M\\cdot} + \\mathrm{\\cdot C_{5}H_{5}}.\n$$\nThe fragment $C_5H_5$ leaves as a neutral radical, which matches the defining criterion for an X-type ligand in the CBC method. This is consistent with the general rule that sigma-bound hydrocarbyl-type ligands are X-type. It is not an L-type ligand, because it does not dissociate as a neutral, closed-shell 2-electron donor, and it is not a Z-type ligand, because it is not an electron acceptor. For context, the $\\eta^5$-cyclopentadienyl ligand is classified as $\\mathrm{L_{2}X}$ (donating six electrons), but in the $\\eta^1$ mode only the sigma-bound X character remains.\n\nTherefore, the $\\eta^1$-cyclopentadienyl ligand is classified as an X-type ligand.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2256635"}, {"introduction": "Organometallic chemists often act as molecular detectives, piecing together clues from various sources to determine a compound's structure. This practice challenges you to do just that, using the 18-electron rule as a guide for stability and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data as evidence of dynamic behavior. By integrating these concepts, you can deduce the ground-state hapticity of a cyclooctatetraene ligand in a rhodium complex, gaining insight into the fascinating phenomenon of fluxionality where ligands rapidly change their coordination mode [@problem_id:2256651].", "problem": "An organometallic chemist synthesizes a complex with the formula $[Rh(C_5H_5)(C_8H_8)]$. Experimental analysis reveals that it is a stable, diamagnetic species, a strong indication that it conforms to the 18-electron rule for valence electrons. The cyclopentadienyl ligand, $C_5H_5$, is known to bind in its common pentahapto fashion $(\\eta^5)$.\n\nA key piece of data comes from Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^1$H NMR) spectroscopy. At room temperature, the spectrum of the complex displays only two sharp singlets: one for the five protons of the $C_5H_5$ ring and one for the eight protons of the cyclooctatetraene ($C_8H_8$) ring. The single resonance for the $C_8H_8$ protons indicates that a rapid intramolecular dynamic process makes all eight of these protons chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale.\n\nTo determine the ground-state structure of this molecule, you must first deduce the hapticity of the cyclooctatetraene ligand. For the purpose of electron counting, use the ionic model and adhere to the following conventions:\n- Rhodium (Rh) is a group 9 element.\n- The cyclopentadienyl ligand ($C_5H_5$) should be treated as the cyclopentadienyl anion ($Cp^−$), which is a 6-electron donor.\n- The cyclooctatetraene ligand ($C_8H_8$) should be treated as a neutral molecule. The number of electrons it donates is equal to its hapticity.\n- The overall charge of the complex is neutral.\n\nBased on this information, what is the hapticity of the cyclooctatetraene ligand in the static, ground-state structure of the $[Rh(C_5H_5)(C_8H_8)]$ complex?\n\nA. $\\eta^2$\n\nB. $\\eta^3$\n\nC. $\\eta^4$\n\nD. $\\eta^6$\n\nE. $\\eta^8$", "solution": "Use the ionic model with the given conventions. Let the oxidation state of Rh be $x$. Charge balance for the neutral complex gives\n$$x+(-1)+0=0 \\Rightarrow x=+1.$$\nRhodium is group 9, so the $d$-electron count is\n$$d=\\text{group number}-\\text{oxidation state}=9-1=8,$$\nthat is, Rh(I) is $d^{8}$. For ligand electron donation: $Cp^{-}$ donates $6$ electrons, and neutral $C_{8}H_{8}$ donates $h$ electrons, where $h$ is its hapticity as specified. The total valence electron count is therefore\n$$VE=8+6+h=14+h.$$\nStability and diamagnetism indicate an $18$-electron configuration, so enforce\n$$14+h=18 \\Rightarrow h=4.$$\nThus, in the ground-state structure the cyclooctatetraene binds as $\\eta^{4}$. This choice uniquely satisfies the $18$-electron rule; alternatives give $VE=16$ for $\\eta^{2}$, $17$ for $\\eta^{3}$, $20$ for $\\eta^{6}$, and $22$ for $\\eta^{8}$, which are inconsistent with the stated 18-electron, diamagnetic nature. The single $^1$H NMR resonance for the eight $C_{8}H_{8}$ protons is consistent with rapid haptotropic shifts that average an $\\eta^{4}$-bound COT on the NMR timescale.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2256651"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical models and spectroscopic data provide powerful inferences, direct structural measurement offers unambiguous proof of molecular connectivity.
