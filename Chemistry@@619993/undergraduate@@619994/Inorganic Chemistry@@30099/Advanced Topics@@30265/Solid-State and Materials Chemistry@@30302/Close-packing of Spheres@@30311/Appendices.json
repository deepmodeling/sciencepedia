In this state, the argon atoms can be modeled as hard spheres packed together in a highly regular arrangement. Experimental evidence shows that argon crystallizes in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice structure. In this arrangement, atoms are positioned at the eight corners and at the center of each of the six faces of a cubic unit cell. The atoms are packed as closely as possible, which means that the atoms along the diagonal of each face of the cube are in direct contact with each other.\n\nLet the atomic radius of an argon atom be denoted by the parameter $r$.

This exercise guides you through calculating the atomic packing efficiency, a dimensionless measure of packing density that applies to any close-packed structure. This calculation not only reveals the theoretical limit for packing identical spheres but also provides the quantitative reason why these arrangements are considered \"close-packed\" [@problem_id:2239354].", "problem": "In the field of materials science, the creation of photonic crystals often involves the self-assembly of uniform, spherical nanoparticles into a highly ordered lattice.

For a close-packed array of identical hard spheres, the crystal structure can be taken as face-centered cubic (FCC), which has the same packing efficiency as hexagonal close-packed (HCP). In an FCC unit cell, the number of whole spheres per cell is obtained by counting contributions: there are eight corner spheres each contributing a fraction $\\frac{1}{8}$ and six face-centered spheres each contributing a fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$, giving a total of $4$ spheres per unit cell.\n\nLet $r$ be the sphere radius and $a$ the cubic lattice parameter. In the closest-packed FCC arrangement, spheres touch along the face diagonal. The length of a face diagonal is $a\\sqrt{2}$, and along this diagonal there are two contacts between three collinear sphere centers, so the total center-to-center distance equals $4r$.

To fully characterize the HCP lattice, we must understand its ideal geometry, which is defined by the ratio of its lattice parameters, $c/a$. This practice explores the three-dimensional arrangement unique to HCP by examining the perfect tetrahedron formed by four mutually touching atoms, allowing you to derive the fundamental geometric constant that defines an ideal HCP crystal [@problem_id:2239363].", "problem": "In materials science, the arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice dictates the material's physical properties. An engineer is studying a novel metallic element, which is predicted to crystallize in a Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) structure under standard conditions. This structure is built by stacking layers of perfectly spherical, identical atoms in an alternating ABAB... sequence. Within any single layer, the atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern where each atom is in contact with six neighbors. The atoms of a B-layer are positioned in the depressions, or \"hollows,\" of the A-layer below it.\n\nConsider a fundamental unit within this structure: a group of four mutually touching atoms. Three of these atoms form an equilateral triangle in one layer (e.g., layer A), and the fourth atom from the adjacent layer (layer B) rests in the hollow at the center of this triangle.

The vertices of this tetrahedron are the centers of four mutually-touching spheres in an HCP lattice.\n\nLet the edge length of the regular tetrahedron be $a$. All six edges have this length because all four spheres are mutually in contact. The base of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle with side length $a$. Let the vertices of this base be denoted by points A, B, and C, and let the apex of the tetrahedron be D. The height of the tetrahedron, which we will call $h$, is the perpendicular distance from the apex D to the plane containing the triangle ABC.\n\nThe foot of the perpendicular from the apex D to the base plane will land on the centroid of the equilateral triangle ABC. Let's call this point O. The height of the tetrahedron is the length of the segment DO, so $h = |DO|$.\n\nTo find the height $h$, we can form a right-angled triangle using the apex D, the centroid of the base O, and any vertex of the base, say A. The triangle is $\\triangle$DOA. The hypotenuse is the edge DA, which has length $a$. The legs are the height $h = |DO|$ and the distance from a vertex of the base to the centroid, $|AO|$. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n$|DO|^2 + |AO|^2 = |DA|^2$\n$h^2 + |AO|^2 = a^2$\n\nTo solve for $h$, we first need to find the length $|AO|$. In an equilateral triangle, the centroid divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio. Let's first find the length of a median of the base triangle ABC. Let M be the midpoint of the edge BC. The median is the segment AM. The triangle $\\triangle$AMB is a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse AB of length $a$ and one leg BM of length $a/2$.
