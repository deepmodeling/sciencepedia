A common industrial route to produce fine $BaTiO_3$ powder is the high-temperature solid-state reaction, often called calcination. In this process, a stoichiometric mixture of solid barium carbonate ($BaCO_3$) and solid titanium dioxide ($TiO_2$) is heated to temperatures exceeding 1000 °C. During the reaction, the two solid precursors combine to form the desired solid product, $BaTiO_3$, while also releasing a gaseous byproduct.

By conservation of mass and element balance, all barium and titanium in the reactants must appear in the solid perovskite product, so we propose the reaction:\n$$\nBaCO_{3}(\\text{s}) + TiO_{2}(\\text{s}) \\rightarrow BaTiO_{3}(\\text{s}) + G(\\text{g}).\n$$\nBalancing elements:\n- Barium: $1$ on both sides (in $BaTiO_{3}$).\n- Titanium: $1$ on both sides (in $BaTiO_{3}$).\n- Carbon: $1$ on the left (in $BaCO_{3}$), so $G$ must contain $1$ carbon atom.\n- Oxygen: total on the left is $3$ (from $BaCO_{3}$) $+$ $2$ (from $TiO_{2}$) $=$ $5$. In $BaTiO_{3}$ there are $3$ oxygen atoms, so the gaseous product must contain the remaining $2$ oxygen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the gaseous product with $1$ carbon and $2$ oxygen atoms is:\n$$\nG = CO_{2}.\n$$\nTo verify, write the balanced reaction:\n$$\nBaCO_{3} + TiO_{2} \\rightarrow BaTiO_{3} + CO_{2},\n$$\nwhich conserves $Ba$, $Ti$, $C$, and $O$ ($5$ oxygen atoms on each side).

You will learn to interpret a PXRD pattern from a synthesis attempt, a vital skill for diagnosing reaction outcomes and guiding the optimization of synthesis conditions.", "problem": "A materials chemist is synthesizing the perovskite ceramic strontium titanate ($SrTiO_3$) using a solid-state reaction method. The procedure involves mixing stoichiometric quantities of dry, powdered strontium oxide ($SrO$) and titanium dioxide ($TiO_2$). The intended reaction is:\n$$ SrO(s) + TiO_2(s) \\xrightarrow{\\Delta} SrTiO_3(s) $$\nThe powdered mixture is pressed into a pellet and heated in a furnace at 1100 °C for 12 hours. After the reaction, the sample is cooled to room temperature and ground into a fine powder to assess the outcome. The primary characterization technique used is Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD), which identifies crystalline materials based on their unique diffraction patterns.\n\nThe resulting PXRD pattern shows a series of strong diffraction peaks that perfectly match the standard reference pattern for crystalline $SrTiO_3$. However, the chemist also observes a set of less intense, but clearly defined, peaks. Upon comparing these with reference databases, these weaker peaks are found to correspond exactly to the diffraction patterns of the starting materials, $SrO$ and $TiO_2$.\n\nAssuming the PXRD instrument is functioning correctly and the reference patterns are accurate, what is the most valid conclusion to be drawn from these observations?\n\nA. The reaction produced a non-crystalline (amorphous) version of $SrTiO_3$, so the observed peaks must correspond only to unreacted starting materials.\n\nB. The reaction was successful and went to completion, but the $SrTiO_3$ product has a crystal structure that coincidentally produces diffraction peaks identical to $SrO$ and $TiO_2$.\n\nC. The solid-state reaction was incomplete, resulting in a final product that is a mixture of the desired $SrTiO_3$ phase and residual, unreacted starting materials.\n\nD. The reaction failed to occur at all, and the sample is simply a physical mixture of the starting powders that were heated together.\n\nE. An unknown impurity was present in one of the starting materials, which remained inert during the heating process and is responsible for the extra peaks.", "solution": "The interpretation of powder X-ray diffraction relies on Bragg’s law,\n$$n\\lambda=2d\\sin\\theta,$$\nwhich connects each crystalline phase’s unique set of interplanar spacings $d$ to diffraction angles $\\theta$ for a given wavelength $\\lambda$ and integer order $n$. Each crystalline phase yields a characteristic fingerprint: a specific set of peak positions and relative intensities. If multiple crystalline phases are present, the observed PXRD pattern is the superposition of the individual patterns from each phase.\n\nGiven:\n- Strong peaks that match the standard pattern for crystalline $SrTiO_{3}$ unambiguously demonstrate that a crystalline $SrTiO_{3}$ phase is present. An amorphous $SrTiO_{3}$ would not yield sharp Bragg peaks but rather broad diffuse scattering, so option A is invalid.\n- Additional weaker peaks that exactly match the reference patterns of $SrO$ and $TiO_{2}$ indicate that these crystalline phases are also present in the sample. The assumption that the instrument and references are correct rules out misassignment or instrumental artifacts.\n- The hypothesis that the $SrTiO_{3}$ structure coincidentally reproduces peaks identical to both $SrO$ and $TiO_{2}$ (option B) is not physically plausible, because exact coincidence across multiple peaks with correct relative positions and spacings for two distinct phases is extraordinarily unlikely and would contradict the uniqueness of phase fingerprints.\n- The presence of strong $SrTiO_{3}$ peaks rules out the claim that no reaction occurred and that the sample is only the heated starting mixture (option D).\n- Attributing the extra peaks to an unknown impurity (option E) is inconsistent with the explicit match to the starting materials’ reference patterns and the presence of both sets of their peaks.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent and valid conclusion is that the solid-state reaction did proceed to form crystalline $SrTiO_{3}$ but did not go to completion, leaving residual $SrO$ and $TiO_{2}$ in the product. This corresponds to a multiphase mixture where the PXRD pattern is the superposition of $SrTiO_{3}$, $SrO$, and $TiO_{2}$ patterns, i.e., option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2288529"}, {"introduction": "Beyond bulk powders, many modern technologies require materials in the form of highly ordered thin films.
