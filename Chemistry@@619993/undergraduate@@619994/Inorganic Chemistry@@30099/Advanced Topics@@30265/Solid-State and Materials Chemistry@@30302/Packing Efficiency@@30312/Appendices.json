By solving this problem [@problem_id:2277334], you will learn to define a two-dimensional unit cell and apply packing analysis in a different geometric context, strengthening your conceptual flexibility.", "problem": "In materials science, the arrangement of atoms on a surface can be modeled as a two-dimensional packing of identical circular disks. Consider a specific arrangement known as a \"running bond\" lattice, analogous to a common bricklaying pattern. This structure is defined by the following set of rules:\n\n1.  The structure consists of identical circular disks, each with a radius $r$.\n2.  The disks are arranged in parallel horizontal rows.\n3.  Within any single row, each disk is tangent to its two neighbors.\n4.  The line of centers for each row is shifted horizontally by a distance $r$ relative to the row immediately below it.\n5.  The vertical distance separating the lines of centers of any two adjacent rows is exactly $2r$.\n\nCalculate the two-dimensional packing efficiency for this running bond lattice. The packing efficiency is the fraction of the total area of the plane that is occupied by the disks. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "To determine the packing efficiency, we first need to identify the smallest repeating unit of the pattern, known as the unit cell. Then, we calculate the area of this unit cell and the area occupied by the disks within it. The packing efficiency is the ratio of these two areas.\n\nLet's establish a coordinate system. Let the center of a disk in a row (let's call it row $m=0$) be at the origin $(0,0)$.\nAccording to rule 3, disks within a row are tangent. Since the radius is $r$, the distance between centers of adjacent disks in the same row is $2r$. So, the centers of disks in row $m=0$ are located at positions $(2nr, 0)$ for any integer $n$.\n\nAccording to rules 4 and 5, the next row (row $m=1$) is shifted horizontally by $r$ and vertically by $2r$. Therefore, the centers of the disks in row $m=1$ are located at positions $(r + 2nr, 2r)$ for any integer $n$.\n\nThe general position of a disk center in row $m$ can be described as being shifted horizontally by $m \\times r$ and vertically by $m \\times 2r$ from a corresponding starting lattice, so the centers are at $((2n+m)r, 2mr)$.\n\nWe can define the unit cell using two basis vectors, $\\vec{v}_1$ and $\\vec{v}_2$, that connect the centers of adjacent disks and generate the entire lattice through translation.\n\nLet's choose $\\vec{v}_1$ as the vector connecting the centers of two adjacent disks in the same row. Taking the disk at the origin $(0,0)$ and its neighbor in the same row, the vector is:\n$\\vec{v}_1 = (2r, 0) - (0,0) = (2r, 0)$.\n\nLet's choose $\\vec{v}_2$ as the vector connecting the center of a disk to the center of a nearby disk in the adjacent row. Taking the disk at the origin $(0,0)$ and a disk in the row above ($m=1$), a convenient choice is the one whose center is at $(r, 2r)$. The vector is:\n$\\vec{v}_2 = (r, 2r) - (0,0) = (r, 2r)$.\n\nThese two vectors, $\\vec{v}_1$ and $\\vec{v}_2$, form the sides of a parallelogram-shaped unit cell. The area of this unit cell, $A_{cell}$, can be calculated as the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors in three dimensions (by appending a zero z-component), or more simply, as the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the two 2D vectors.\n$A_{cell} = |\\det(\\vec{v}_1, \\vec{v}_2)| = \\left| \\begin{vmatrix} 2r & r \\\\ 0 & 2r \\end{vmatrix} \\right| = |(2r)(2r) - (r)(0)| = |4r^2 - 0| = 4r^2$.\nAlternatively, the area of a parallelogram is given by base $\\times$ height. The base can be taken as the length of $\\vec{v}_1$, which is $2r$. The height is the perpendicular distance to the line containing $\\vec{v}_1$ from the end of $\\vec{v}_2$, which is simply the y-component of $\\vec{v}_2$, or $2r$. Thus, $A_{cell} = (2r)(2r) = 4r^2$.\n\nA unit cell defined by the basis vectors of a lattice contains exactly one lattice point. In our case, each lattice point corresponds to the center of one disk. Therefore, there is the equivalent of one full disk per unit cell.\n\nThe area occupied by the disk(s) within one unit cell, $A_{disks}$, is the area of a single disk:\n$A_{disks} = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe packing efficiency, $PE$, is the ratio of the area occupied by the disks to the total area of the unit cell:\n$$PE = \\frac{A_{disks}}{A_{cell}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we calculate the value of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and round it to four significant figures.\n$PE \\approx 0.78539816...$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.7854$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7854}$$", "id": "2277334"}, {"introduction": "A true test of scientific understanding is the ability to apply fundamental principles to novel situations.
