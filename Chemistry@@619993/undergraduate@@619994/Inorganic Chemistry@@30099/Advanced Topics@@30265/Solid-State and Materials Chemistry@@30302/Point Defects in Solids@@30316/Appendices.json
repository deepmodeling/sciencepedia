This first practice introduces the Kröger-Vink notation, the standard convention for describing defects, their location in a crystal lattice, and their effective electrical charge. Mastering this notation is a foundational skill, enabling you to unambiguously represent complex defect structures and the charge-compensation mechanisms that are critical to designing materials like solid-state batteries and fuel cells [@problem_id:2283019].", "problem": "In the development of materials for advanced applications like Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), the controlled introduction of point defects is a critical strategy for tuning material properties. Calcia-stabilized zirconia is one such material, created by doping a zirconium dioxide ($ZrO_2$) host lattice with calcium oxide ($CaO$). In this doped ceramic, $Ca^{2+}$ ions substitutionally replace $Zr^{4+}$ ions on the cation sublattice. To maintain overall charge neutrality within the crystal, this substitution is accompanied by the formation of oxide ion vacancies.\n\nThe Kröger-Vink notation is a standard convention used to describe point defects in a crystal. A defect is represented by the general form $M_S^C$, where $M$ is the species (an ion, atom, or vacancy $V$), $S$ is the lattice site it occupies, and $C$ represents the effective electrical charge of the defect relative to the perfect lattice. The effective charge is denoted by a superscript: a dot ($\\bullet$) for each unit of positive charge, a prime (') for each unit of negative charge, and a cross ($\\times$) for a neutral defect.\n\nConsidering the doping of $ZrO_2$ with $CaO$ as described, which of the following options correctly lists the Kröger-Vink notations for these three species: (i) a calcium ion on a zirconium site, (ii) an oxide ion vacancy, and (iii) an oxide ion on a normal oxide ion site?\n\nA. $Ca''_{Zr}, V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}, O_O^\\times$\n\nB. $Ca^{\\bullet\\bullet}_{Zr}, V_O'', O_O^\\times$\n\nC. $Ca_{Zr}^\\times, V_O^\\times, O_O^\\times$\n\nD. $Zr''_{Ca}, V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}, O_O^\\times$\n\nE. $Ca''_{Zr}, V_O'', Ca_O^\\times$", "solution": "To determine the correct Kröger-Vink notations, we must analyze each species within the context of the $ZrO_2$ host lattice. The perfect lattice consists of $Zr^{4+}$ cations and $O^{2-}$ anions. The effective charge of a defect is calculated as the difference between the charge of the species occupying the site and the charge of the ion that would normally occupy that site in a perfect crystal.\n\nLet's evaluate each of the three species mentioned in the problem:\n\n1.  **A calcium ion on a zirconium site:**\n    *   The main species ($M$) is Calcium, $Ca$.\n    *   The lattice site ($S$) it occupies is a zirconium site, $Zr$.\n    *   The effective charge ($C$) is the charge of the calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$, charge = +2) minus the charge of the original zirconium ion on that site ($Zr^{4+}$, charge = +4).\n    *   Effective charge = (charge of $Ca^{2+}$) - (charge of $Zr^{4+}$) = $(+2) - (+4) = -2$.\n    *   An effective charge of -2 is represented by two prime symbols ('').\n    *   Combining these parts gives the notation: $Ca''_{Zr}$.\n\n2.  **An oxide ion vacancy:**\n    *   The main species ($M$) is a vacancy, denoted by $V$.\n    *   The lattice site ($S$) that is vacant is an oxide ion site, $O$.\n    *   The effective charge ($C$) is the charge of the vacancy (which is 0) minus the charge of the original oxide ion on that site ($O^{2-}$, charge = -2).\n    *   Effective charge = (charge of vacancy) - (charge of $O^{2-}$) = $(0) - (-2) = +2$.\n    *   An effective charge of +2 is represented by two dot symbols ($\\bullet\\bullet$).\n    *   Combining these parts gives the notation: $V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}$.\n    *   This positively charged defect provides the necessary charge compensation for the negatively charged $Ca''_{Zr}$ defect, ensuring overall charge neutrality in the crystal. Specifically, one $V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}$ defect is formed for every $Ca''_{Zr}$ defect introduced.\n\n3.  **An oxide ion on a normal oxide ion site:**\n    *   The main species ($M$) is an oxide ion, $O$.\n    *   The lattice site ($S$) it occupies is a regular oxide ion site, $O$.\n    *   The effective charge ($C$) is the charge of the oxide ion on the site ($O^{2-}$, charge = -2) minus the charge of the ion that normally occupies that site (which is also an $O^{2-}$ ion, charge = -2).\n    *   Effective charge = (charge of $O^{2-}$) - (charge of $O^{2-}$) = $(-2) - (-2) = 0$.\n    *   A neutral effective charge of 0 is represented by a cross symbol ($\\times$).\n    *   Combining these parts gives the notation: $O_O^\\times$.\n\nTherefore, the correct set of Kröger-Vink notations for a calcium ion on a zirconium site, an oxide ion vacancy, and an oxide ion on a normal site are $Ca''_{Zr}$, $V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}$, and $O_O^\\times$, respectively. This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2283019"}, {"introduction": "Building on the description of defects, we now explore one of their most important consequences: non-stoichiometry. Crystals must always maintain overall charge neutrality, and this exercise demonstrates how the presence of vacancies can be balanced by a change in the oxidation state of other ions in the lattice. By working through the example of metal-deficient nickel oxide [@problem_id:2282994], you will practice applying the principle of charge conservation to quantify the relationship between defect concentration and the electronic structure of a material.", "problem": "A sample of nickel oxide is found to be non-stoichiometric with the empirical formula $Ni_{0.96}O$. This metal deficiency arises from the presence of vacancies at the sites that would normally be occupied by $Ni^{2+}$ ions.
