When individual atoms coalesce to form a solid crystal, their atomic orbitals combine to form a vast number of molecular orbitals, which are so closely spaced in energy that they form continuous bands. This first practice establishes the quantitative relationship between the number of contributing atomic orbitals and the total number of available electronic states within an energy band, a foundational skill for building any band structure diagram.

The material is a perfect crystal containing a very large number, $N$, of identical atoms arranged in a three-dimensional lattice. According to band theory, the discrete atomic orbitals of the individual atoms interact and combine to form continuous energy bands. The focus of the investigation is the band formed from the set of atomic p-orbitals. Assuming that each of the $N$ atoms contributes its complete set of valence p-orbitals to the formation of this p-band, determine the total number of distinct electronic energy states (molecular orbitals) that constitute this band.

The degree to which the highest-energy band is filled dictates a material's electrical properties. This exercise uses the classic example of lithium to illustrate why elements with a single valence electron in an $s$-orbital form a half-filled band, providing a clear and powerful explanation for their metallic conductivity.

In this model, we consider the formation of an energy band from the interaction of the valence 2s atomic orbitals of all the lithium atoms.

Each of the $N$ lithium atoms contributes one $2s$ atomic orbital, and their interaction forms $N$ Bloch-like molecular orbitals that make up the $2s$ band.

Based on a simple band-filling model, an element like beryllium with its [He] $2s^2$ electron configuration might be predicted to be an insulator with a full $2s$ band. This practice challenges you to resolve this paradox by introducing the crucial concept of band overlap, a phenomenon that explains the metallic nature of beryllium and other alkaline earth metals. [@problem_id:2234649]", "problem": "In the band theory of solids, atomic orbitals of individual atoms in a crystal lattice combine to form continuous energy bands. An s-orbital from each of the $N$ atoms in a crystal forms an s-band containing $N$ molecular orbitals, which can hold a total of $2N$ electrons. Similarly, three p-orbitals from each atom form a p-band that can hold $6N$ electrons. A material is typically an electrical conductor (a metal) if its highest-energy occupied band is only partially filled. If it is completely filled and there is a significant energy gap to the next available empty band, the material is an insulator.\n\nConsider a crystal of solid beryllium (Be), which has the atomic electron configuration [He] $2s^2$. Based on a simple model considering only the filling of the 2s band, one might make an incorrect prediction about its electrical properties. In reality, beryllium is a metal.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for why solid beryllium is a metal?\n\nA. The energy of the filled 2s band is sufficiently high, and the energy of the empty 2p band is sufficiently low, that they overlap. This overlap creates a single, continuous, partially-filled band of electronic states, allowing for electron conduction.\n\nB. Beryllium is a semiconductor at absolute zero temperature, but at room temperature, thermal energy is sufficient to promote a significant number of electrons from the filled 2s band across a small energy gap to the empty 2p band, enabling conduction.\n\nC. The high pressure within the solid crystal lattice forces the two electrons in each 2s orbital to un-pair, leaving the 2s band only half-full and thus conductive.\n\nD. Before forming bands, the 2s and 2p orbitals of each beryllium atom hybridize to form sp hybrid orbitals. The resulting sp-band is only half-full, leading to metallic behavior.\n\nE. Pure beryllium is an insulator, but its observed metallic properties are due to the unavoidable presence of impurities and crystal defects that introduce states within the band gap.", "solution": "We consider band formation in a crystal with $N$ atoms. An $s$-orbital from each atom produces an $s$-band with $N$ molecular orbitals that can hold $2N$ electrons (two spins per orbital). A $p$-band formed from three $p$-orbitals per atom contains $3N$ molecular orbitals and can hold $6N$ electrons. For beryllium, each atom supplies two valence electrons from the $2s^{2}$ configuration, so across the crystal there are $2N$ electrons to place in the $2s$-derived band. In a naive picture with a large energy gap between $2s$ and $2p$, the $2s$ band would be completely filled and the $2p$ band empty, implying insulating behavior if there is a significant gap to the next empty band.\n\nIn real solids, Bloch bands acquire finite bandwidths determined by orbital overlaps and the periodic potential. For light elements like Be, the atomic $2s$ and $2p$ levels are close in energy, and the resulting $2s$ and $2p$ bands broaden sufficiently that their energy ranges overlap. When the top of the $2s$ band overlaps the bottom of the $2p$ band, electrons occupy states across the overlapping region up to the Fermi energy, leaving partially filled states at the Fermi level. A partially filled band at zero temperature permits mobile carriers and thus metallic conduction.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A states that the filled $2s$ band and empty $2p$ band overlap in energy, producing a continuous, partially filled band that enables conduction. This correctly captures the $s$-$p$ band overlap in Be.\n- B claims thermally activated promotion across a small gap; this would imply semiconducting behavior at zero temperature, which contradicts Be being metallic at zero temperature.\n- C invokes unpairing due to pressure; spin pairing does not determine band filling in this way, and pressure does not force half-filling of the $2s$ band.\n- D invokes pre-band sp hybridization leading to a half-filled band; while $s$-$p$ mixing can occur in bands, the key is band overlap rather than a half-filled hybrid band prior to band formation.\n- E attributes metallicity to impurities; pure Be is intrinsically metallic due to intrinsic band structure, not impurity states.\n\nTherefore, the correct reasoning is the overlap of the $2s$ and $2p$ bands leading to a partially filled band.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2234649"}]}
