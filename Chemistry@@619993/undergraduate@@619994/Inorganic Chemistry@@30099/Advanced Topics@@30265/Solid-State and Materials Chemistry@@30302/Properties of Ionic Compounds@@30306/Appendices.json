The problem provides the following values:\n$r_{c} = r_{Ca^{2+}} = 100$ pm\n$r_{a} = r_{F^{-}} = 133$ pm\n\nThe radius ratio is calculated as:\n$$p = \\frac{r_c}{r_a} = \\frac{100 \\text{ pm}}{133 \\text{ pm}} \\approx 0.75188$$\n\nThe radius ratio rule provides a set of ranges for $p$ that predict the most stable coordination number (CN) for the cation, assuming the ions pack as hard spheres. The standard ranges for the cation's CN are:\n- $0.225 \\le p < 0.414 \\implies CN = 4$ (tetrahedral arrangement of anions around the cation)\n- $0.414 \\le p < 0.732 \\implies CN = 6$ (octahedral arrangement of anions around the cation)\n- $0.732 \\le p \\le 1.000 \\implies CN = 8$ (cubic arrangement of anions around the cation)\n\nOur calculated radius ratio of $p \\approx 0.752$ falls into the range $0.732 \\le p \\le 1.000$. This predicts that the coordination number of the cation, $Ca^{2+}$, is 8. This means each $Ca^{2+}$ ion is expected to be in direct contact with 8 $F^{-}$ ions.\n\nThe second step is to determine the coordination number of the anion, $F^{-}$. An ionic crystal must be electrically neutral. This requirement establishes a direct relationship between the stoichiometric coefficients in the chemical formula and the coordination numbers of the ions. For a general ionic compound with the formula $M_x A_y$, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$x \\times CN(M) = y \\times CN(A)$$\nwhere $CN(M)$ and $CN(A)$ are the coordination numbers of the cation and anion, respectively.\n\nFor calcium fluoride, $CaF_2$, the stoichiometric coefficients are $x=1$ (for Ca) and $y=2$ (for F). We use the predicted coordination number for the cation, $CN(Ca^{2+}) = 8$, in the equation:\n$$1 \\times CN(Ca^{2+}) = 2 \\times CN(F^{-})$$\n$$1 \\times 8 = 2 \\times CN(F^{-})$$\nSolving for the anion's coordination number, we find:\n$$CN(F^{-}) = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$$\n\nThus, the radius ratio model predicts that in the $CaF_2$ crystal structure, each $Ca^{2+}$ ion has a coordination number of 8, and each $F^{-}$ ion has a coordination number of 4. This is often denoted as an (8, 4) coordination.\n\nThe final step is to examine the given options and find the one that matches our prediction. The stoichiometry of $CaF_2$ is 1:2.\n- A. The rock salt structure has (6, 6) coordination and 1:1 stoichiometry. This is incorrect.\n- B. The rutile structure has (6, 3) coordination and 1:2 stoichiometry. While the stoichiometry is correct, the coordination numbers do not match our prediction of (8, 4).\n- C. The fluorite structure has (8, 4) coordination and 1:2 stoichiometry. This perfectly matches our predictions for both coordination numbers and stoichiometry.\n- D. The antifluorite structure has (4, 8) coordination and 2:1 stoichiometry. This is the reverse of the fluorite structure and does not match the stoichiometry or coordination of $CaF_2$.\n- E. The cesium chloride structure has (8, 8) coordination and 1:1 stoichiometry. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the fluorite structure is the only option that is consistent with the predictions from the radius ratio rule for $CaF_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2284471"}, {"introduction": "While we often learn about perfect, stoichiometric crystals, many real-world ionic compounds exhibit defects and variable compositions.
