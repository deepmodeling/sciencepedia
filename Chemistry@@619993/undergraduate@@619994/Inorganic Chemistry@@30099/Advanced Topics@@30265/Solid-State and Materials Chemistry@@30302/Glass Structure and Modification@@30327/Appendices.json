This first practice provides a foundational exercise in stoichiometry, allowing you to calculate the precise fraction of NBOs in a common alkali-silicate glass based on its chemical formula [@problem_id:2255234].", "problem": "In the formation of silicate glasses, pure silica ($SiO_2$) consists of a three-dimensional network where silicon atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated to four oxygen atoms. In this ideal network, every oxygen atom acts as a link between two silicon atoms, and is thus called a Bridging Oxygen (BO). When a metal oxide, termed a network modifier, is introduced into the silica melt, it disrupts the network by breaking some of these Si-O-Si linkages. This process creates oxygen atoms that are bonded to only one silicon atom; these are referred to as Non-Bridging Oxygens (NBO). The charge imbalance created by an NBO is compensated by a nearby metal cation.\n\nConsider a specific alkali-silicate glass, lithium disilicate, which has an exact molar composition corresponding to the formula $Li_2O \\cdot 2SiO_2$. Within this glass structure, each formula unit of the network modifier, $Li_2O$, is responsible for breaking one Si-O-Si bridge, thereby creating two Non-Bridging Oxygens. Based on this model, determine the fraction of all oxygen atoms in the lithium disilicate glass that are non-bridging. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "The composition $Li_{2}O \\cdot 2SiO_{2}$ corresponds to the stoichiometric formula $Li_{2}Si_{2}O_{5}$ for one combined formula unit. The total number of oxygen atoms per such unit is\n$$\nn_{O} = 1 \\text{ (from } Li_{2}O) + 2 \\times 2 \\text{ (from } 2SiO_{2}) = 5.\n$$\nBy the stated model, each $Li_{2}O$ creates two Non-Bridging Oxygens (NBO), so for this composition\n$$\nn_{\\text{NBO}} = 2.\n$$\nTherefore, the fraction of oxygen atoms that are non-bridging is\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\text{NBO}}}{n_{O}} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4.\n$$\nAs a consistency check using bond counting, let $n_{\\text{BO}}$ and $n_{\\text{NBO}}$ be the numbers of bridging and non-bridging oxygens, respectively.

This exercise explores the practical consequences of network modification by examining how the chemical durability of a glass responds to changes in its composition [@problem_id:2255258]. By connecting the atomic-scale structure to its resistance in acidic environments, you will grasp a key principle in designing glass for specific applications.", "problem": "In the manufacturing of commercial glass, silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$), a network former, is often mixed with metal oxides like sodium oxide ($Na_2O$), which act as network modifiers to lower the melting temperature and viscosity. A materials scientist is studying a series of simple binary sodium silicate glasses. The glasses are prepared with varying compositions, characterized by the molar ratio of the network modifier to the network former, $R = \\frac{n_{Na_2O}}{n_{SiO_2}}$, where $n$ represents the number of moles. The scientist wants to understand how this compositional change affects the material's resistance to chemical attack.\n\nConsider a set of these sodium silicate glass samples where the ratio $R$ is systematically increased. Each sample is then submerged in a dilute aqueous acidic solution at a constant temperature. Based on the fundamental principles of glass structure, how is the chemical durability of the glass expected to change as the ratio $R$ increases, and why?\n\nA. The chemical durability will increase, because the sodium ions fill interstitial voids in the silica network, making it denser and less permeable to the acidic solution.\n\nB. The chemical durability will decrease, because the addition of sodium oxide breaks covalent bonds in the silica network, creating sites for ion-exchange with protons from the acid.\n\nC. The chemical durability will remain essentially constant, as the fundamental $Si-O$ covalent network remains the dominant structural feature and is inherently resistant to acid.\n\nD. The chemical durability will first increase and then decrease, because an initial small addition of sodium oxide relieves ring strain in the silica network, but larger amounts cause significant degradation.\n\nE. The chemical durability will decrease, because the sodium oxide acts as a catalyst, directly accelerating the hydrolysis of $Si-O-Si$ bonds by the acid.", "solution": "We consider sodium silicate glasses composed of a network former, $SiO_{2}$, and a network modifier, $Na_{2}O$. The composition is parameterized by $R = \\frac{n_{Na_{2}O}}{n_{SiO_{2}}}$. The structural role of $Na_{2}O$ is to depolymerize the $Si-O-Si$ network by creating non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) that are charge-balanced by $Na^{+}$.\n\nPrinciple 1: Charge balance and NBO stoichiometry. Each $Na_{2}O$ contributes two $Na^{+}$ ions to charge-balance two non-bridging oxygens, so the number of NBOs equals the number of $Na^{+}$, which is $2 n_{Na_{2}O}$. The number of tetrahedrally coordinated silicon atoms equals $n_{SiO_{2}}$. Therefore, the number of non-bridging oxygens per tetrahedron (NBO/T) is\n$$\n\\text{NBO/T} = \\frac{2 n_{Na_{2}O}}{n_{SiO_{2}}} = 2R.\n$$\nAs $R$ increases, $\\text{NBO/T}$ increases linearly, indicating progressive depolymerization of the network.\n\nPrinciple 2: Network connectivity. A fully polymerized silica network has $4$ bridging oxygens per tetrahedron. Introducing NBOs reduces the average number of bridging oxygens per tetrahedron to\n$$\n4 - \\text{NBO/T} = 4 - 2R,\n$$\nwhich decreases with increasing $R$. Lower connectivity weakens the network and increases free volume and pathways for transport.\n\nPrinciple 3: Acidic corrosion mechanism. In dilute acidic solutions, the initial and often dominant step is ion-exchange between mobile alkali cations and protons from solution at sites associated with NBOs:\n$$\n\\equiv Si-O^{-} Na^{+} + H^{+}_{(aq)} \\to \\equiv Si-OH + Na^{+}_{(aq)}.\n$$\nAs $\\text{NBO/T}$ increases with $R$, the density of exchangeable sites increases, enhancing the rate of alkali leaching. This exchange also protonates the network, which facilitates subsequent hydrolysis of $Si-O-Si$ linkages:\n$$\n\\equiv Si-O-Si \\equiv + H_{2}O \\to \\equiv Si-OH + HO-Si \\equiv,\n$$\na process made more favorable in the vicinity of NBOs due to reduced bond strength and increased local basicity prior to protonation. Thus, higher $R$ leads to faster ion-exchange and hydrolysis, i.e., lower chemical durability.\n\nAssessment of options based on these principles:\n- A is incorrect because $Na_{2}O$ does not fill interstitial voids to densify; it breaks $Si-O-Si$ bonds and creates NBOs, opening the network.\n- B is correct: adding $Na_{2}O$ breaks covalent $Si-O-Si$ bonds, increases NBO density, and creates sites for $H^{+}/Na^{+}$ exchange, decreasing durability.\n- C is incorrect because the modifier content strongly affects durability via NBO formation and ion-exchange pathways.\n- D is not supported in this simple binary system under dilute acid; the typical trend is a monotonic decrease in durability with increasing modifier content.\n- E is incorrect in mechanism: $Na_{2}O$ is not acting as a catalyst; it alters structure rather than providing a catalytic cycle.\n\nTherefore, as $R$ increases, chemical durability decreases due to increased depolymerization and enhanced ion-exchange and hydrolysis, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2255258"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple oxide glasses, modern materials science employs sophisticated models to design glasses with highly optimized properties from the ground up.
