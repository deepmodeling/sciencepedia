[@problem_id:2279931]", "problem": "The spinel crystal structure, with the general formula $AB_2O_4$, is adopted by many mixed-metal oxides. In this structure, the oxide ions form a cubic close-packed lattice, creating two types of interstitial sites for the cations: tetrahedral sites and octahedral sites. The distribution of the $A^{2+}$ and $B^{3+}$ cations between these sites determines whether the spinel is \"normal\" or \"inverse\".\n\n-   **Normal Spinel:** Divalent $A^{2+}$ ions occupy the tetrahedral sites, and trivalent $B^{3+}$ ions occupy the octahedral sites. The formula is written as $(A^{2+})_{T_d}[B^{3+}_2]_{O_h}O_4$.\n-   **Inverse Spinel:** The tetrahedral sites are occupied by half of the trivalent $B^{3+}$ ions, while the octahedral sites are occupied by the divalent $A^{2+}$ ions and the remaining half of the $B^{3+}$ ions. The formula is written as $(B^{3+})_{T_d}[A^{2+}B^{3+}]_{O_h}O_4$.\n\nThe preferred structure is the one that is most thermodynamically stable. For transition metal ions, this stability is often dominated by the total Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) of the cations in their respective sites.\n\nConsider two common spinels: zinc ferrite ($ZnFe_2O_4$) and magnetite ($Fe_3O_4$). Magnetite's formula can be written as $Fe^{2+}Fe^{3+}_2O_4$. Experimentally, $ZnFe_2O_4$ is a normal spinel, while $Fe_3O_4$ is an inverse spinel.\n\nTo analyze this, use the following information:\n1.  The relevant cations and their d-electron configurations are: $Zn^{2+}$ ($d^{10}$), $Fe^{2+}$ ($d^6$, high-spin), and $Fe^{3+}$ ($d^5$, high-spin).\n2.  The CFSE for an ion in an octahedral ($O_h$) field is given by $(-0.4x + 0.6y)\\Delta_o$ and in a tetrahedral ($T_d$) field by $(-0.6p + 0.4q)\\Delta_t$, where $x$ and $p$ are the number of electrons in the lower-energy d-orbitals ($t_{2g}$ for $O_h$, $e$ for $T_d$), and $y$ and $q$ are the number of electrons in the higher-energy d-orbitals ($e_g$ for $O_h$, $t_2$ for $T_d$).\n3.  The crystal field splitting parameters are related by the approximation $\\Delta_t \\approx \\frac{4}{9}\\Delta_o$.\n4.  The structure with the more negative (more stabilizing) total CFSE is favored. If both possible structures yield the same total CFSE, the normal spinel structure is adopted by default.\n\nBased on a comparison of the total CFSE for the normal versus inverse configurations for each compound, which of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for the observed structures?\n\nA. For $ZnFe_2O_4$, both normal and inverse configurations have a total CFSE of 0, so the default normal structure is adopted. For $Fe_3O_4$, the inverse configuration is energetically favored because the CFSE gain from placing $Fe^{2+}$ in an octahedral site is greater than the CFSE gain from placing it in a tetrahedral site.\n\nB. In $Fe_3O_4$, the $Fe^{3+}$ ion has a very strong preference for octahedral sites, forcing the smaller $Fe^{2+}$ ion into the tetrahedral site, resulting in an inverse structure. In $ZnFe_2O_4$, $Zn^{2+}$ also has a strong octahedral preference, making it a normal spinel.\n\nC. The $d^{10}$ configuration of $Zn^{2+}$ and the $d^5$ high-spin configuration of $Fe^{3+}$ are spherically symmetric, leading to a random distribution of cations and an inverse structure for $ZnFe_2O_4$. The opposite is true for $Fe_3O_4$.\n\nD. For $Fe_3O_4$, the normal configuration is more stable based on CFSE, but the entropy gained from mixing $Fe^{2+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$ on the octahedral sites favors the inverse structure at ambient temperature.
