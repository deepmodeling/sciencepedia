This phenomenon is known as compensation doping.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the role of each dopant. The host material is silicon (Si), which belongs to Group 14 of the periodic table. Each Si atom has four valence electrons and forms a covalent network.\n\nThe first dopant is phosphorus (P), from Group 15. Phosphorus has five valence electrons. When a P atom substitutes a Si atom in the crystal lattice, four of its valence electrons form covalent bonds with the neighboring Si atoms. The fifth valence electron is not involved in bonding and is only weakly bound to the P atom. At typical operating temperatures, this electron is easily thermally excited into the conduction band, becoming a free negative charge carrier (an electron). Thus, phosphorus acts as a donor atom. Doping with donors creates an n-type semiconductor where electrons are the majority charge carriers. The concentration of donor atoms, $N_D$, is given as $N_P = 5.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$.\n\nThe second dopant is boron (B), from Group 13. Boron has three valence electrons. When a B atom substitutes a Si atom, it can only form three complete covalent bonds. This leaves one bond with a neighboring Si atom incomplete, creating a vacancy for an electron in the valence band. This vacancy is called a \"hole\". A nearby electron can easily move into this hole, causing the hole to appear to move in the opposite direction. A moving hole acts as a positive charge carrier. Thus, boron acts as an acceptor atom. Doping with acceptors creates a p-type semiconductor where holes are the majority charge carriers. The concentration of acceptor atoms, $N_A$, is given as $N_B = 2.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$.\n\nWhen both donor and acceptor atoms are present in the same crystal, the electrons donated by the donor atoms can \"fall into\" and annihilate the holes created by the acceptor atoms. This process is called recombination or compensation. The net type of the semiconductor is determined by which dopant has a higher concentration.\n\nWe compare the concentration of donors, $N_D$, with the concentration of acceptors, $N_A$:\n$N_D = 5.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$\n$N_A = 2.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$\n\nSince $N_D > N_A$, the donor atoms are more numerous than the acceptor atoms. After all the holes from the acceptors are filled by electrons from the donors, there will be a surplus of electrons. These excess electrons become the majority charge carriers. Therefore, the resulting material is an n-type semiconductor.\n\nThe concentration of the majority carriers (electrons, denoted by $n$) is the effective donor concentration, which is the difference between the initial donor and acceptor concentrations.\n$$ n = N_{D, \\text{effective}} = N_D - N_A $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ n = (5.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3}) - (2.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3}) $$\n$$ n = 3.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3} $$\nSo, the material is n-type with a majority carrier (electron) concentration of $3.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. The material is p-type with a majority carrier concentration of $2.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$. (Incorrect type and concentration)\nB. The material is p-type with a majority carrier concentration of $3.0 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$. (Incorrect type)\nC.
