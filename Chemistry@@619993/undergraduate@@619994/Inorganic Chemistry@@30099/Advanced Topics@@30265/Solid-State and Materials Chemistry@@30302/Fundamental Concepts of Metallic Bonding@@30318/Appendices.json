This exercise [@problem_id:2254388] challenges you to apply this model to predict the relative melting points of a series of elements. By analyzing factors such as the number of delocalized valence electrons and cationic charge, you will develop a deeper understanding of what contributes to the strength of a metallic bond and learn to recognize when simple trends need to be refined with more detailed structural information.", "problem": "The strength of the metallic bond, which dictates properties like melting point, is influenced by several factors, including the number of delocalized valence electrons per atom, the charge of the resulting metal cation in the \"electron sea\" model, and the size of the cation. A greater number of delocalized electrons and a higher charge density (charge per unit volume) on the cation generally lead to a stronger metallic bond and a higher melting point.\n\nConsider the three period 4 elements: Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), and Gallium (Ga). Based on the principles of metallic bonding, select the option that correctly orders these elements by increasing melting point and provides the most accurate physical justification for this trend.\n\nA. K < Ca < Ga. This order arises because the number of valence electrons available for metallic bonding increases from one (K), to two (Ca), to three (Ga), systematically strengthening the metallic bond across the period.\n\nB. Ga < K < Ca. This order is a result of Gallium's unique crystal structure, where atoms form covalently bonded diatomic units (dimers). The melting process primarily involves overcoming the weak forces between these units, leading to an anomalously low melting point. The relative melting points of K and Ca follow the expected trend based on the number of delocalized electrons.\n\nC. Ca < K < Ga. This order is determined by atomic size being the dominant factor. Gallium is the smallest, leading to the highest melting point, while Calcium is the largest of the three, resulting in the weakest bonds.\n\nD. Ga < Ca < K. This order occurs because the d-electrons in Gallium are not involved in bonding and provide significant shielding, which weakens the metallic bond more than any other factor, making its melting point the lowest. Calcium has a higher melting point than Potassium due to a less effective shielding effect.\n\nE. K < Ga < Ca. This order reflects a competition between the number of valence electrons and atomic size. While Gallium has more valence electrons than Potassium, its larger size compared to Calcium weakens its bonds, placing it in the middle.", "solution": "First, apply the metallic bonding model: the melting point correlates with the strength of the metallic bond, which increases with (i) the number of delocalized valence electrons per atom and the resulting cation charge, and (ii) the cation charge density, which scales qualitatively as $\\propto \\frac{q}{r^{3}}$ for cation charge $q$ and ionic radius $r$. Larger $q$ and smaller $r$ generally strengthen the metallic bond; fewer delocalized electrons and larger $r$ weaken it.\n\nSecond, compare potassium and calcium. Potassium has electron configuration $[\\text{Ar}]\\,4s^{1}$ and forms $K^{+}$ with one delocalized electron per atom; calcium has $[\\text{Ar}]\\,4s^{2}$ and forms $Ca^{2+}$ with two delocalized electrons per atom. The higher cation charge and greater number of delocalized electrons in calcium, along with a smaller cation size than potassium, give $Ca$ a larger effective charge density and stronger metallic bonding. Therefore, $K$ has a lower melting point than $Ca$.\n\nThird, assess gallium. Gallium has $[\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^{10}4s^{2}4p^{1}$ and nominally three valence electrons, which might suggest strong metallic bonding. However, the filled $3d^{10}$ shell screens ineffectively, increasing the effective nuclear charge on the $4s$ and $4p$ electrons and contracting them, favoring directional bonding and a low-coordination structure. In solid $\\alpha$-Ga, atoms form short Ga–Ga contacts that are effectively covalent dimer-like units, with much weaker interactions between these units. The melting process thus primarily overcomes weak inter-unit interactions, giving an anomalously low melting point. Consequently, despite its nominally higher valence electron count, gallium’s metallic bonding is weakened by its dimerized, low-coordination structure, yielding a melting point even lower than potassium’s.\n\nPutting these together, the increasing melting point order is $Ga < K < Ca$. Among the options, this ordering and the justification that gallium’s anomalously low melting point arises from its dimer-like, covalently influenced crystal structure are captured correctly by option B. The relative positions of $K$ and $Ca$ follow the expected trend from the number of delocalized electrons and higher cation charge density for $Ca$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2254388"}, {"introduction": "While the electron sea model provides a good qualitative picture, the Drude model allows us to make quantitative predictions about electrical conductivity.
