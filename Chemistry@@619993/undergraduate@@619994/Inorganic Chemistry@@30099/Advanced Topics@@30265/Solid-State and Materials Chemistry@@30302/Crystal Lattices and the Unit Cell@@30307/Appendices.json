One common arrangement is the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. In an idealized FCC unit cell, atoms are modeled as identical, incompressible hard spheres. These spheres are located at each of the eight corners of a cube and in the center of each of the six faces. The packing is assumed to be as dense as possible, which means that spheres representing adjacent atoms are in contact.\n\nThe Atomic Packing Factor (APF) is a dimensionless quantity that measures the efficiency of this packing. It is defined as the total volume occupied by the atoms within a single unit cell divided by the total volume of that unit cell.\n\nLet the atomic radius of the spheres be $r$ and the edge length of the cubic unit cell be $a$.
