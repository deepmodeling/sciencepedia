The notation takes the general form $M_S^C$, where $M$ is the chemical species occupying a site, $S$ is the lattice site being occupied, and $C$ is the effective electrical charge of the species relative to the site. The effective charge is calculated as (charge of species $M$) - (charge of site $S$). An effective charge of zero is denoted by $^x$, a positive effective charge of $+n$ by $n$ dots (e.g., $^{\\cdot\\cdot}$ for $+2$), and a negative effective charge of $-n$ by $n$ primes (e.g., $^{\\prime\\prime}$ for $-2$).\n\nCalcium fluoride ($\\text{CaF}_2$) is an ionic solid with the fluorite crystal structure, composed of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ cations and $\\text{F}^-$ anions.

A powerful technique for enhancing ionic conductivity is aliovalent doping, where we intentionally introduce impurity atoms with a different charge state into the crystal. This practice challenges you to think like a materials designer, using the fundamental principle of charge neutrality to determine which dopant will successfully create the desired charge-carrying vacancies in Barium Fluoride ($\\text{BaF}_2$). [@problem_id:2262712]", "problem": "To enhance the ionic conductivity of solid Barium Fluoride ($\\text{BaF}_2$), which is a fluoride ion conductor, it is desirable to increase the concentration of fluoride ion vacancies. This process, known as doping, involves introducing a small amount of a different compound, the dopant, into the host crystal lattice. Consider two potential dopants for $\\text{BaF}_2$: Lanthanum Fluoride ($\\text{LaF}_3$) and Potassium Chloride ($\\text{KCl}$).\n\nThe crystal structure of $\\text{BaF}_2$ consists of a lattice of $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ and $\\text{F}^-$ ions. When doping, it can be assumed that the dopant cations substitute for the host $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ cations, and any dopant anions substitute for the host $\\text{F}^-$ anions. To maintain the stability of the crystal, the overall charge neutrality must be preserved.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the appropriate dopant to increase the fluoride vacancy concentration and provides the correct primary reasoning based on charge compensation?\n\nA. $\\text{LaF}_3$ should be used, because the substitution of a trivalent $\\text{La}^{3+}$ ion for a divalent $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ion creates a local charge surplus, which is compensated by the formation of a fluoride ion vacancy.\n\nB. $\\text{KCl}$ should be used, because the substitution of a monovalent $\\text{K}^+$ ion for a divalent $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ion creates a local charge deficit, which is compensated by the formation of a fluoride ion vacancy.\n\nC. $\\text{LaF}_3$ should be used, because the anion of the dopant ($\\text{F}^-$) is the same as the host, ensuring minimal disruption and allowing for vacancy creation on the cation sublattice, which in turn promotes fluoride vacancy formation.\n\nD. $\\text{KCl}$ should be used, because the substitution of a $\\text{Cl}^-$ ion for a $\\text{F}^-$ ion creates strain in the lattice, which is relieved by ejecting a neighboring fluoride ion, thus creating a vacancy.\n\nE. Either dopant is equally effective, as the introduction of any foreign ions into a crystal lattice inherently increases the concentration of all types of point defects, including vacancies.", "solution": "We seek to increase the concentration of fluoride ion vacancies in $\\text{BaF}_2$. Let the host cations be $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ on cation sites and anions $\\text{F}^{-}$ on anion sites. A substitutional dopant on the cation sublattice that decreases the net positive charge on that site creates a negatively charged effective defect, which must be compensated by positively charged defects, notably anion (fluoride) vacancies. Conversely, a substitutional dopant on the cation sublattice that increases the net positive charge creates a positively charged effective defect, which must be compensated by negatively charged defects (e.g., anion interstitials or cation vacancies), not by anion vacancies.\n\nWrite the charge-compensation logic explicitly.\n\n1) Doping with $\\text{LaF}_3$:\n- Substitution: $\\text{La}^{3+}$ on a $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ site creates a $+1$ effective charge on the cation sublattice. In Kröger–Vink notation, this is $La_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\bullet}$.\n- A fluoride vacancy $V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}$ carries a positive effective charge. Therefore, using $V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}$ to compensate $La_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\bullet}$ would not satisfy charge neutrality because both are positively charged.\n- Charge neutrality is instead maintained by creating negatively charged defects, e.g., fluoride interstitials $F_{i}^{\\prime}$ (effective charge $-1$) or cation vacancies $V_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\prime\\prime}$ (effective charge $-2$). A representative incorporation reaction that preserves neutrality is:\n$$\n\\text{LaF}_{3} \\rightarrow La_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\bullet} + 2F_{\\mathrm{F}}^{x} + F_{i}^{\\prime} \\, ,\n$$\nwhich shows no creation of fluoride vacancies. Thus, $\\text{LaF}_3$ does not increase fluoride vacancy concentration; instead it tends to generate $\\text{F}^{-}$ interstitials or other negatively charged defects.\n\n2) Doping with $\\text{KCl}$:\n- Substitution: $\\text{K}^{+}$ on a $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ site creates a $-1$ effective charge on the cation sublattice. In Kröger–Vink notation, this is $K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\prime}$.\n- The anion $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ substituting on an $\\text{F}^{-}$ site is isovalent and thus neutral: $Cl_{\\mathrm{F}}^{x}$.\n- To preserve electroneutrality, the $-1$ effective charge of $K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\prime}$ is compensated by creating a positively charged defect. The relevant positively charged defect that promotes fluoride ion conduction is the fluoride vacancy $V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}$. A representative incorporation reaction is:\n$$\n\\text{KCl} \\rightarrow K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\prime} + Cl_{\\mathrm{F}}^{x} + V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet} \\, .\n$$\n- Charge neutrality then reads\n$$\n(-1)\\,n_{K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\prime}} + (+1)\\,n_{V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n_{V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}} = n_{K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\prime}} \\, ,\n$$\nshowing that each $\\text{K}^{+}$ substitution creates one fluoride vacancy.\n\nConclusion:\n- $\\text{LaF}_3$ introduces a trivalent cation on a divalent site, which requires negatively charged compensating defects (e.g., $\\text{F}^{-}$ interstitials), not fluoride vacancies, so it does not increase the fluoride vacancy concentration.\n- $\\text{KCl}$ introduces a monovalent cation on a divalent site, which is compensated by creating positively charged fluoride vacancies, thereby increasing their concentration.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the option that identifies $\\text{KCl}$ as the appropriate dopant and justifies it via charge-compensation by fluoride vacancies.\n\nThis matches statement B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2262735"}, {"introduction": "Our discussion so far has been built on the premise that ions are the mobile charge carriers in these materials.
