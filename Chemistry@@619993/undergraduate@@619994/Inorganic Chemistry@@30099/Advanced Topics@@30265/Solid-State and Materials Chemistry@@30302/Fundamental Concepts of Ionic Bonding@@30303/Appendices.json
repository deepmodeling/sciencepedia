This exercise moves beyond simple calculation to build your chemical intuition, asking you to apply the core principles of electrostatics that are quantified in the Kapustinskii equation. By qualitatively comparing potassium oxide ($\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$) and calcium oxide ($\\text{CaO}$), you will learn to critically assess how ionic charge and ionic radius govern the strength of an ionic bond and the overall stability of the resulting solid [@problem_id:2254217].", "problem": "Metal oxides are a critical class of materials used in applications ranging from ceramics to catalysts, where their high-temperature stability is paramount. The thermal stability of an ionic oxide is strongly correlated with its lattice energy—the energy released when gaseous ions combine to form one mole of a solid ionic compound. A more exothermic (more negative) lattice energy generally indicates a more stable crystal lattice.\n\nConsider two metal oxides: potassium oxide ($\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$) and calcium oxide ($\\text{CaO}$). Based on the fundamental principles governing electrostatic interactions in an ionic lattice, and without performing any calculations, select the option that correctly identifies which compound is expected to have a higher magnitude of lattice energy and provides the most complete reasoning.\n\nA. $\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$, because the potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$) is larger than the calcium ion ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$), which reduces repulsion.\n\nB. $\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$, because its formula unit contains two cations, leading to more electrostatic attractions per formula unit.\n\nC. $\\text{CaO}$, because the magnitude of the ionic charges ($+2$ and $-2$) is greater than in $\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$ ($+1$ and $-2$).\n\nD. $\\text{CaO}$, because the calcium ion ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$) is smaller than the potassium ion ($\\text{K}^+$), leading to a smaller internuclear distance.\n\nE. $\\text{CaO}$, for the combined reasons that the ionic charges have a greater magnitude and the cation is smaller.\n\nF. The lattice energies are expected to be very similar because both compounds contain the same oxide anion ($\\text{O}^{2-}$).", "solution": "Lattice energy for an ionic crystal can be modeled by the Born–Landé expression, which captures the dominant electrostatic interactions and short-range repulsion:\n$$\nU = -\\frac{N_{A} M z_{+} z_{-} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r_{0}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $N_{A}$ is Avogadro’s number, $M$ is the Madelung constant determined by the lattice geometry, $z_{+}$ and $z_{-}$ are the ionic charges, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity, $r_{0}$ is the nearest-neighbor cation–anion separation, and $n$ is the Born exponent describing repulsion. The magnitude of $U$ increases with larger $|z_{+} z_{-}|$ and smaller $r_{0}$, all else equal.\n\nFor $\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$, the ions are $\\text{K}^{+}$ and $\\text{O}^{2-}$, so $|z_{+} z_{-}|=2$. For $\\text{CaO}$, the ions are $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\text{O}^{2-}$, so $|z_{+} z_{-}|=4$. Thus, the electrostatic attraction term proportional to $|z_{+} z_{-}|/r_{0}$ is larger in magnitude for $\\text{CaO}$ than for $\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$ due to the higher ionic charge product.\n\nNext, consider $r_{0}$. The cation–anion separation $r_{0}$ is approximately the sum of the ionic radii. Between $\\text{K}^{+}$ and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is smaller than $\\text{K}^{+}$ because both are isoelectronic with a noble gas configuration, but $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ has a higher nuclear charge attracting the same number of electrons more strongly. Therefore, $r_{0}$ is smaller in $\\text{CaO}$ than in $\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$, which further increases the magnitude of the lattice energy for $\\text{CaO}$.\n\nTherefore, both principal factors governing lattice energy in the Born–Landé model favor $\\text{CaO}$: it has a larger ionic charge product and a smaller nearest-neighbor distance. Options citing only one of these effects (charges alone or size alone) are incomplete. Arguments based on “more cations per formula unit” do not correctly reflect the dependence of $U$ on $z_{+} z_{-}$ and $r_{0}$, and the presence of the same anion does not make the lattice energies similar because cation charge and size differ substantially.\n\nHence, the correct and most complete reasoning is that $\\text{CaO}$ has the higher magnitude of lattice energy due to both the higher ionic charges and the smaller cation size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2254217"}, {"introduction": "Periodic trends are invaluable predictive tools, but exploring their apparent exceptions often leads to a more profound understanding of the underlying physics. This problem tackles a classic chemical anomaly: the fact that chlorine's electron affinity is more exothermic than that of fluorine, contrary to expectations based on size [@problem_id:2254214]. Critiquing a flawed argument will help you appreciate the delicate balance between nucleus-electron attraction and the often-overlooked but crucial effect of interelectronic repulsion within compact electron shells.", "problem": "In an introductory chemistry discussion, a student proposes the following argument: \"The atomic radius of fluorine is smaller than that of chlorine. According to Coulomb's Law, the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and an incoming electron should be stronger for fluorine because the distance is smaller. Therefore, the process of adding an electron to a fluorine atom must release more energy than adding an electron to a chlorine atom. In other words, the electron affinity of fluorine must be more exothermic than that of chlorine.\"\n\nHowever, experimental data shows this conclusion is incorrect; the electron affinity of chlorine ($-349 \\text{ kJ/mol}$) is, in fact, more exothermic than that of fluorine ($-328 \\text{ kJ/mol}$). Which of the following statements provides the best explanation for this observed chemical anomaly?\n\nA. Chlorine's greater number of protons results in a significantly higher effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$) experienced by the incoming electron, and this effect is the dominant factor.\n\nB. The incoming electron is added to the compact $n=2$ shell of fluorine, where it experiences strong interelectronic repulsion from the existing valence electrons. This repulsion is weaker in the more diffuse $n=3$ shell of chlorine.\n\nC. Fluorine has a much higher first ionization energy than chlorine, indicating its valence electrons are held more tightly, which consequently makes the accommodation of an additional electron less energetically favorable.\n\nD. The core electrons in chlorine (those in the $n=1$ and $n=2$ shells) provide superior shielding of the nuclear charge compared to the core electrons in fluorine (the $n=1$ shell), thereby weakening the attraction for the incoming electron.\n\nE. As a noble gas precedes fluorine in the periodic table, fluorine's electron configuration is less stable than chlorine's, making it less favorable to accept an electron.", "solution": "We analyze electron affinity as the net energy change upon adding an electron to a neutral atom. In a many-electron atom, the leading contributions to the energy change can be written schematically as\n$$\n\\Delta E \\approx \\Delta U_{\\text{nuc-e}} + \\Delta U_{\\text{e-e}} + \\Delta E_{\\text{relax}},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta U_{\\text{nuc-e}}  0$ is the additional nucleus–electron attraction, $\\Delta U_{\\text{e-e}} > 0$ is the increase in electron–electron repulsion due to the new electron, and $\\Delta E_{\\text{relax}}$ accounts for orbital relaxation and correlation. The electron affinity is exothermic when $\\Delta E  0$, and its magnitude increases when the attractive term dominates over the repulsive and relaxation terms.\n\nBy Coulomb’s law, a pair interaction has potential energy\n$$\nU(r)=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r}.\n$$\nThus, for the added electron with charge $-e$, the attractive nucleus–electron term scales like\n$$\n\\Delta U_{\\text{nuc-e}}\\sim -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}} e^{2}}{\\langle r\\rangle},\n$$\nwhile the repulsive electron–electron terms scale like a sum over existing electrons,\n$$\n\\Delta U_{\\text{e-e}}\\sim \\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\frac{e^{2}}{\\langle r_{i}\\rangle}.\n$$\nBoth terms vary approximately as $1/r$, but they differ in how orbital size and crowding affect them. The average radial extent of an orbital follows the hydrogenic trend $\\langle r\\rangle\\propto a_{0} n^{2}/Z_{\\text{eff}}$ for given angular momentum. Therefore, adding an electron to a $2p$ orbital (fluorine) places it in a much more compact region than adding it to a $3p$ orbital (chlorine).\n\nBecause the $2p$ shell in fluorine is compact, the incoming electron is forced into close proximity with the existing $2p$ valence electrons. This greatly increases $\\Delta U_{\\text{e-e}}$ through short-range Coulomb repulsion, since each pairwise repulsion term scales as $1/r$ and $r$ is small in the $n=2$ shell. In chlorine, the added electron occupies the more diffuse $3p$ region, increasing the typical separations and thereby reducing $\\Delta U_{\\text{e-e}}$ relative to fluorine. Although fluorine’s smaller radius tends to make $\\Delta U_{\\text{nuc-e}}$ more negative, the increase in repulsion in the crowded $2p$ shell more than offsets that gain, making the net $\\Delta E$ less negative (less exothermic) for fluorine than for chlorine.\n\nThis explains the observed ordering that the electron affinity of chlorine is more exothermic than that of fluorine. Evaluating the provided statements:\n- A is incomplete: while $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ matters, the anomaly arises because interelectronic repulsion in fluorine’s compact $2p$ shell dominates, not because of a simple $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ increase.\n- B correctly identifies that the added electron in fluorine enters the compact $n=2$ shell and suffers stronger electron–electron repulsion than in chlorine’s more diffuse $n=3$ shell.\n- C confuses ionization energy with electron affinity; the higher first ionization energy of fluorine does not directly provide the mechanism for the electron affinity anomaly.\n- D predicts weaker attraction in chlorine due to shielding, which would suggest a less exothermic electron affinity for chlorine, contrary to observation.\n- E is irrelevant and incorrect in its rationale about stability preceding a noble gas.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that the added electron experiences significantly stronger interelectronic repulsion in fluorine’s compact $2p$ shell than in chlorine’s more diffuse $3p$ shell, reducing the exothermicity for fluorine relative to chlorine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2254214"}, {"introduction": "The Born-Haber cycle provides a complete thermodynamic picture of ionic bond formation, elegantly connecting macroscopic measurements like enthalpy of formation with microscopic atomic properties.
