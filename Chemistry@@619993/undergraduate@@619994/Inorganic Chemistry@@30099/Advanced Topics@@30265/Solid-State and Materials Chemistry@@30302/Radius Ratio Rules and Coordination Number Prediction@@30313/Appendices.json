This practice [@problem_id:2285991] presents a classic puzzle: why does Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) exhibit multiple crystal forms (polymorphism) while Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is exceptionally stable in a single structure? By comparing their respective radius ratios, you will discover how a value's proximity to a stability boundary can signal energetic competition between different structures, moving your skills from simple prediction to nuanced chemical insight.", "problem": "A materials scientist is studying the structural chemistry of binary ionic compounds. It is empirically known that Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) commonly crystallizes in two distinct polymorphs, zincblende and wurtzite, both of which feature a 4:4 coordination environment where each ion is surrounded by four ions of the opposite charge. In contrast, Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is exceptionally stable in a single structure, the rock salt form, which exhibits a 6:6 coordination environment.\n\nTo investigate this difference, the scientist decides to apply the radius ratio rules, which predict the most stable coordination number (CN) for an ionic compound based on the ratio of the cation radius ($r_+$) to the anion radius ($r_-$).\n\nUsing the data provided below, determine which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for the observed structural behavior of ZnS and NaCl.\n\n**Provided Data:**\nIonic Radii:\n- $r(Na^+) = 102 \\text{ pm}$\n- $r(Cl^-) = 181 \\text{ pm}$\n- $r(Zn^{2+}) = 74 \\text{ pm}$\n- $r(S^{2-}) = 184 \\text{ pm}$\n\nRadius Ratio ($r_+/r_-$) Ranges for Idealized Ionic Packing:\n- $0.225 \\le r_+/r_- < 0.414$: Predicted CN = 4 (Tetrahedral geometry)\n- $0.414 \\le r_+/r_- < 0.732$: Predicted CN = 6 (Octahedral geometry)\n- $0.732 \\le r_+/r_- < 1.000$: Predicted CN = 8 (Cubic geometry)\n\n**Choices:**\nA. The radius ratio for ZnS is $0.451$, which falls in the octahedral range, while its observed structures are tetrahedral. This mismatch is the primary reason for polymorphism. The NaCl ratio of $0.564$ correctly predicts its octahedral structure, hence its stability.\n\nB. The radius ratio for NaCl is $0.564$, placing it securely in the middle of the range for octahedral coordination, indicating a strong preference for a single structure. In contrast, the ratio for ZnS is $0.402$, which is very close to the critical boundary value of $0.414$ between tetrahedral and octahedral coordination, suggesting a small energy difference between competing structures, thus allowing for polymorphism.\n\nC. The radius ratios for both ZnS and NaCl are well within their respective predicted ranges (tetrahedral for ZnS, octahedral for NaCl). Therefore, the radius ratio rules cannot explain polymorphism, which must arise entirely from the stronger covalent character in ZnS compared to the purely ionic NaCl.\n\nD. Both compounds exhibit polymorphism, but the transition for NaCl to a different structure requires extreme pressures not typically encountered. The smaller radius ratio for ZnS ($0.402$) compared to NaCl ($0.564$) fundamentally indicates greater bond strain, which is the universal cause of polymorphism in all ionic compounds.", "solution": "We apply the radius ratio rule, which states that the preferred coordination number is predicted by the ratio $r_{+}/r_{-}$ falling within specified intervals:\n- If $0.225 \\le r_{+}/r_{-} < 0.414$, then CN $=4$ (tetrahedral).\n- If $0.414 \\le r_{+}/r_{-} < 0.732$, then CN $=6$ (octahedral).\n- If $0.732 \\le r_{+}/r_{-} < 1.000$, then CN $=8$ (cubic).\n\nCompute the radius ratios using the provided ionic radii.\n\nFor NaCl:\n$$\n\\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}}=\\frac{r(\\mathrm{Na}^{+})}{r(\\mathrm{Cl}^{-})}=\\frac{102 \\text{ pm}}{181 \\text{ pm}} \\approx 0.564.\n$$\nSince $0.414 \\le 0.564 < 0.732$, the predicted CN is $6$ (octahedral), which matches the rock salt structure and supports its stability as a single dominant form.\n\nFor ZnS:\n$$\n\\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}}=\\frac{r(\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+})}{r(\\mathrm{S}^{2-})}=\\frac{74 \\text{ pm}}{184 \\text{ pm}} \\approx 0.402.\n$$\nSince $0.225 \\le 0.402 < 0.414$, the predicted CN is $4$ (tetrahedral), which matches the zincblende and wurtzite structures (both 4:4).

This suggests a small energetic separation between competing coordinations or related tetrahedral polytypes, rationalizing the occurrence of polymorphism in ZnS, whereas NaCl’s ratio near the middle of the octahedral range indicates a stronger preference for a single structure.\n\nEvaluate the choices against these calculations:\n- A is incorrect because it uses an incorrect ratio for ZnS and wrongly claims a mismatch with tetrahedral coordination.\n- B is consistent with the calculated ratios, correctly places NaCl securely within the octahedral range, and highlights ZnS’s proximity to the tetrahedral–octahedral boundary as a reason for polymorphism.\n- C incorrectly asserts that radius ratio rules cannot explain polymorphism despite the boundary proximity offering a reasonable rationalization; it also overstates that polymorphism must arise entirely from covalency.\n- D overgeneralizes by attributing polymorphism universally to bond strain inferred from smaller radius ratios, which is not supported by the radius ratio rule.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation based on the provided data and radius ratio rules is given by choice B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2285991"}, {"introduction": "The principles of ionic packing extend far beyond simple binary salts into the realm of advanced materials design.
