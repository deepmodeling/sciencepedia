For the reaction $\\mathrm{K}(s)+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\mathrm{I}_{2}(s)\\to \\mathrm{KI}(s)$, the cycle decomposes this into the following steps:\n- Atomization of potassium: $\\mathrm{K}(s)\\to \\mathrm{K}(g)$ with enthalpy $\\Delta H_{\\text{atom}}(\\mathrm{K})>0$ (endothermic).\n- First ionization of potassium: $\\mathrm{K}(g)\\to \\mathrm{K}^{+}(g)+e^{-}$ with enthalpy $IE_{1}(\\mathrm{K})>0$ (endothermic).\n- Atomization of iodine: $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\mathrm{I}_{2}(s)\\to \\mathrm{I}(g)$ with enthalpy $\\Delta H_{\\text{atom}}(\\mathrm{I})>0$ (endothermic, encompassing sublimation and half the bond dissociation).\n- First electron affinity of iodine: $\\mathrm{I}(g)+e^{-}\\to \\mathrm{I}^{-}(g)$ with enthalpy $EA_{1}(\\mathrm{I})<0$ (exothermic; energy is released when the electron is added).\n- Lattice step: $\\mathrm{K}^{+}(g)+\\mathrm{I}^{-}(g)\\to \\mathrm{KI}(s)$.

While $EA_{1}(\\mathrm{I})$ is also exothermic and sometimes tabulated with a positive numerical “affinity” (magnitude) that can cause sign confusion, the most common and impactful sign error in this context, given the explicit definition of $U_{L}$ as an endothermic separation energy, is using $+U_{L}$ instead of $-U_{L}$ in the Born-Haber summation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely source of the sign error is the lattice enthalpy term.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2294027"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of correctly assigning signs to each energy term, we now move to a complete quantitative application of the Born-Haber cycle.
