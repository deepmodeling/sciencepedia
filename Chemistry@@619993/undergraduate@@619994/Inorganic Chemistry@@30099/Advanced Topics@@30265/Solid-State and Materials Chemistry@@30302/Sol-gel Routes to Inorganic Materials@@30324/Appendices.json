This first practice applies fundamental stoichiometric principles to a classic sol-gel reaction, allowing you to calculate the theoretical yield of a material like silica ($SiO_2$) from a common precursor, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). Mastering this calculation [@problem_id:2288362] is an essential first step for planning laboratory experiments and evaluating the efficiency of a synthesis.", "problem": "In materials science, the sol-gel process is a versatile method for synthesizing solid materials from small molecules. A common precursor for producing pure silica ($SiO_2$) glass is tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), with the chemical formula $Si(OC_2H_5)_4$. When TEOS undergoes complete hydrolysis and condensation, it reacts with water to form solid silica and ethanol ($C_2H_5OH$) as a byproduct. The overall balanced chemical reaction can be summarized as:\n\n$$Si(OC_2H_5)_4 (l) + 2H_2O (l) \\rightarrow SiO_2 (s) + 4C_2H_5OH (l)$$\n\nAssume you start with a sample of $20.83$ g of pure TEOS and an excess of water, and the reaction proceeds to completion.

This exercise introduces you to this vital concept, which refers to the number of reactive groups available for network-forming reactions on a single precursor molecule. By learning to identify the functionality of different precursors [@problem_id:2288343], you gain the ability to predict and ultimately design materials with specific macroscopic properties, from viscous liquids to solid gels.", "problem": "In the synthesis of advanced materials via the sol-gel process, the choice of precursor molecules is critical as it dictates the structure and properties of the final product. A key characteristic of a precursor molecule, such as an organosilane, is its \"functionality\". The functionality is defined as the number of hydrolyzable groups attached to the central metalloid atom. These hydrolyzable groups are susceptible to reaction with water, leading to the formation of a network. A common type of hydrolyzable group is an alkoxy group (e.g., methoxy, $-\\text{OCH}_3$, or ethoxy, $-\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$), which reacts with water to form a hydroxyl group and an alcohol. In contrast, groups bonded to the central atom via a stable carbon-metalloid bond are typically non-hydrolyzable under standard sol-gel conditions.\n\nConsider the organosilane precursor vinyltrimethoxysilane, which has the chemical formula $CH_2=CH-Si(OCH_3)_3$. This molecule is used to create hybrid organic-inorganic polymers. Based on the provided definition, determine the functionality of the vinyltrimethoxysilane molecule.", "solution": "By definition in sol-gel chemistry, the functionality of a precursor is the number of hydrolyzable groups bound to the central metalloid atom; here, the central atom is silicon. Hydrolyzable groups include alkoxy substituents such as methoxy, while groups attached through a silicon–carbon bond (e.g., a vinyl group) are non-hydrolyzable under standard sol-gel conditions.\n\nFor vinyltrimethoxysilane with formula $CH_2=CH-Si(OCH_3)_3$, the silicon is bonded to three methoxy groups $(-OCH_3)$ and one vinyl group $(-CH=CH_2)$. The three methoxy groups are hydrolyzable, and the vinyl group is not.\n\nTherefore, the functionality equals the count of hydrolyzable groups:\n$$f=\\text{number of hydrolyzable groups on Si}=3.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2288343"}, {"introduction": "The rate at which a sol transforms into a gel is not just a matter of waiting; it is a controllable parameter governed by chemical kinetics. The speed of the initial hydrolysis step is particularly important, and it depends heavily on the molecular structure of the precursor. This practice challenges you to compare the reactivity of two common silicon alkoxides [@problem_id:2288385], using your knowledge of reaction mechanisms to reason about the influence of steric and electronic effects on the reaction rate.", "problem": "The sol-gel process is a versatile method for synthesizing inorganic materials, often starting from metal alkoxide precursors. A crucial initial step in this process is hydrolysis, where water molecules react with the precursor. Consider two common silicon-based precursors: tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), with the chemical formula $Si(OCH_3)_4$, and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), with the chemical formula $Si(OCH_2CH_3)_4$. The hydrolysis reaction involves a nucleophilic attack by a water molecule on the central silicon atom.\n\nBased on the principles of chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms, which of the following statements correctly compares the initial rates of hydrolysis for TMOS and TEOS under identical conditions (concentration, temperature, and pH), and provides the most accurate justification?\n\nA. TEOS hydrolyzes faster than TMOS because the larger ethoxy groups are better leaving groups than methoxy groups.\n\nB. The hydrolysis rates are virtually identical because the Si-O bond being cleaved has the same strength in both molecules.\n\nC. TMOS hydrolyzes faster than TEOS because the smaller methoxy groups provide less steric hindrance, allowing for easier nucleophilic attack on the silicon center.\n\nD. TEOS hydrolyzes faster than TMOS because the ethyl groups are more electron-donating than methyl groups, which increases the reactivity of the silicon atom.", "solution": "We compare initial hydrolysis rates of $\\mathrm{Si(OR)_{4}}$ with $R=\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$ (TMOS) versus $R=\\mathrm{CH_{2}CH_{3}}$ (TEOS) under identical concentration, temperature, and pH. The hydrolysis proceeds by nucleophilic attack of water on silicon to give a pentacoordinate transition state/intermediate, followed by Si–OR bond cleavage. For an associative, nucleophile-attack rate-determining step, the rate constant follows the Eyring expression\n$$\nk=\\kappa \\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nso under identical $T$ and solvent, the relative rates are determined by the difference in $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ arising from substituent effects.\n\nSteric effect: The transition state is pentacoordinate at silicon, so crowding around the silicon center increases the activation free energy. Ethoxy groups are larger than methoxy groups, so TEOS experiences greater steric hindrance to nucleophilic approach than TMOS. Thus\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{TEOS}}>\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{TMOS}}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad k_{\\mathrm{TEOS}}<k_{\\mathrm{TMOS}}.\n$$\n\nElectronic effect: Alkoxy substituents donate electron density by an inductive effect; the ethoxy group donates more than the methoxy group. Increased electron donation to silicon decreases its electrophilicity, diminishing the driving force for nucleophilic attack and increasing $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$. This again predicts\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{TEOS}}>\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{TMOS}}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad k_{\\mathrm{TEOS}}<k_{\\mathrm{TMOS}}.\n$$\n\nLeaving-group consideration: Under neutral or base-catalyzed hydrolysis, the leaving group is $\\mathrm{RO^{-}}$. Leaving-group ability correlates inversely with basicity; since the conjugate acid $\\mathrm{ROH}$ of methoxide is slightly more acidic than that of ethoxide, $\\mathrm{CH_{3}O^{-}}$ is not a better leaving group than $\\mathrm{C_{2}H_{5}O^{-}}$, and in any case the rate-determining step is the nucleophilic attack rather than departure. Under acid catalysis, the departing group is protonated $\\mathrm{ROH}$, and differences are small; steric and inductive effects still dominate. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. Statement B is incorrect because rate is governed by the activation barrier, not merely by the ground-state Si–O bond strength. Statement D is incorrect because stronger electron donation by ethyl decreases, not increases, the electrophilicity and reactivity of silicon toward nucleophiles.\n\nConsequently, TMOS hydrolyzes faster than TEOS, primarily due to reduced steric hindrance (with reinforcing electronic effects), which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2288385"}]}
