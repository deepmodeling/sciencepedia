The conventional unit cell of an FCC lattice is a cube with lattice points located at each of its eight corners and at the center of each of its six faces.\n\nTo determine properties like density, it is essential to first know the effective number of atoms contained within a single unit cell. When a lattice is constructed, atoms at different positions within a unit cell are shared with adjacent unit cells. For any cubic crystal system, the following sharing rules apply:\n- A lattice point at a corner is shared equally among 8 adjacent unit cells.\n- A lattice point on an edge is shared equally among 4 adjacent unit cells.\n- A lattice point on a face is shared equally among 2 adjacent unit cells.\n- A lattice point located entirely within the body of the cell belongs exclusively to that cell.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total effective number of lattice points that belong to a single conventional FCC unit cell.", "solution": "In a face-centered cubic conventional unit cell, lattice points occur at the eight corners and at the centers of the six faces.
