In such complexes, oxidative addition of $H_2$ is well known to proceed readily.\n\nBy the fundamental principles of oxidative addition:\n- The metal oxidation state increases by 2 units. Therefore, Ir(I) becomes Ir(III).\n- The metal coordination number increases by 2. Starting from a 4-coordinate square planar complex, addition of $H_2$ yields a 6-coordinate complex.\n- The total valence electron count increases by 2 electrons. From 16 electrons initially, the product has 18 electrons.\n\nThus, the product is a 6-coordinate Ir(III) complex, which for a coordination number of six is characteristically octahedral.\n\nNext, we determine the stereochemical relationship of the two newly formed hydride ligands. The problem states that the addition of $H_2$ proceeds via a concerted, non-radical mechanism. In a concerted oxidative addition of $H_2$ to a square planar $d^8$ complex:\n- The $H-H$ bond approaches and interacts on one face of the square plane through simultaneous $\\sigma$-donation from the $H_2$ $\\sigma$ orbital to an empty metal orbital and back-donation from a filled metal $d$ orbital into the $H_2$ $\\sigma^*$ orbital.\n- Because both new $M-H$ bonds form on the same face of the metal center in a single, stereospecific event, the two hydrides are introduced in a syn fashion.\n- When mapped onto the resulting octahedral geometry, a syn addition from one face of the square planar precursor necessarily yields the two hydrides in a cis relationship in the product.\n\nCombining these outcomes:\n- The product adopts an octahedral geometry (six-coordinate Ir(III), 18-electron).\n- The two hydride ligands are cis to each other as a direct consequence of the concerted oxidative addition pathway.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is an octahedral geometry with the hydrides cis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2276778"}]}
