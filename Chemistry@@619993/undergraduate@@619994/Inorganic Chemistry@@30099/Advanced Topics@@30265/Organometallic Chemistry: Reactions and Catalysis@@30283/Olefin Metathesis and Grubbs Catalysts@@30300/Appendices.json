The key to understanding the effect of concentration is to analyze the kinetics of each competing pathway.\n\nLet's denote the acyclic diene starting material as $D$.\n\nThe intramolecular RCM reaction involves a single molecule of the diene cyclizing to form the macrocyclic product, $P_{intra}$. The rate of this reaction depends on the concentration of the diene. Since it is a unimolecular process with respect to the diene, its rate law can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{intra}} = k_{\\text{intra}} [D]\n$$\nHere, $k_{\\text{intra}}$ is the rate constant for the intramolecular reaction, and $[D]$ is the concentration of the diene. This is a first-order process in $[D]$.\n\nThe intermolecular reaction involves two molecules of the diene reacting to form a dimer, which can then react further to form oligomers, $P_{inter}$. The initial step of this process is bimolecular. The rate law for the formation of the initial dimer is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{inter}} = k_{\\text{inter}} [D][D] = k_{\\text{inter}} [D]^{2}\n$$\nHere, $k_{\\text{inter}}$ is the rate constant for the intermolecular reaction. This is a second-order process in $[D]$.\n\nTo determine which pathway is favored, we can examine the ratio of the rates of the two competing reactions:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{intra}}}{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{inter}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{intra}} [D]}{k_{\\text{inter}} [D]^{2}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{intra}}}{k_{\\text{inter}}} \\frac{1}{[D]}\n$$\nThe ratio of the products formed, $\\frac{[P_{\\text{intra}}]}{[P_{\\text{inter}}]}$, will be proportional to the ratio of their formation rates.\n\nFrom this expression, we can see that the ratio of the intramolecular rate to the intermolecular rate is inversely proportional to the concentration of the diene, $[D]$.\n\n- At **low concentrations** of $[D]$, the term $\\frac{1}{[D]}$ is large, which makes the ratio $\\frac{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{intra}}}{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{inter}}}$ large. This means the intramolecular reaction is favored, leading to a higher yield of the RCM product. This is consistent with the initial successful experiment described in the problem.\n\n- At **high concentrations** of $[D]$, the term $\\frac{1}{[D]}$ becomes smaller, which makes the ratio $\\frac{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{intra}}}{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{inter}}}$ small. This means the intermolecular reaction rate increases more significantly than the intramolecular rate, and the intermolecular pathway becomes dominant.\n\nTherefore, significantly increasing the initial concentration of the diene will favor the second-order intermolecular reaction over the first-order intramolecular reaction. This will lead to a greater proportion of intermolecular oligomers and a smaller proportion of the desired intramolecular RCM product. Consequently, the ratio of the intramolecular RCM product to the intermolecular oligomers will decrease.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\nA. The ratio will increase. This is incorrect; it is the opposite of what happens. This would be true if the concentration were decreased.\nB. The ratio will decrease. This is correct. The higher concentration favors the higher-order intermolecular reaction.\nC. The ratio will remain unchanged. This is incorrect as it ignores the different kinetic orders of the two competing reactions.\nD. Both reactions will be suppressed. This is incorrect. Increasing reactant concentration generally increases reaction rates.\nE. Only the intramolecular product will form. This is incorrect.

The isotopic composition of the ethene byproduct provides insight into the operating mechanism.\n\nIn the RCM catalytic cycle, the ethene byproduct is formed when the active catalyst reacts intermolecularly with a terminal alkene on a new substrate molecule.

The initial catalyst is pure $[L_nRu=CH_2]$. We need to consider its first productive reaction with the substrate $S_{d2}$, which has two distinct and equally reactive terminal olefin groups: a non-deuterated $H_2C=$ group and a deuterated $D_2C=$ group.\n\n- **Path A1: Reaction at the non-deuterated terminus ($H_2C=$)**\nThe $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ catalyst reacts with the $H_2C=$ end of the substrate.

The ethene byproduct is formed from the catalyst's $=CH_2$ group and the substrate's $=CD_2$ group. The product is $d_2$-ethene, $CH_2=CD_2$.\n\nSince we ignore isotope effects, both ends of the substrate are equally reactive, and these two paths are equally probable. Therefore, the initial mixture of ethene byproducts will be a 1:1 mixture of $CH_2=CH_2$ and $CH_2=CD_2$. No $CD_2=CD_2$ can be formed initially because the catalyst pool does not yet contain any $[L_nRu=CD_2]$ species.\nThe initial molar ratio of $(CH_2=CH_2 : CH_2=CD_2 : CD_2=CD_2)$ is **(1:1:0)**.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario B ($k_{deg} \\gg k_{RCM}$)**\n\nIn this scenario, the catalyst's methylidene group rapidly and reversibly exchanges with the terminal methylidene groups of the excess substrate *before* significant RCM occurs.
