In hydroformylation, the regioselectivity—the ratio of the desired linear aldehyde ($n$) to the branched isomer ($iso$)—is of paramount industrial importance. This next practice [@problem_id:2259027] explores how reaction conditions can be manipulated to tune this selectivity, demonstrating a key principle: the active catalyst is often part of a dynamic equilibrium, and its structure and reactivity can be influenced by the concentration of ligands like $CO$.", "problem": "An industrial chemist is overseeing the hydroformylation, also known as the oxo process, of propene to produce aldehydes. The reaction is catalyzed by a homogeneous catalyst system derived from the precursor tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium carbonyl hydride, $HRh(CO)(PPh_3)_3$. The primary objective is to maximize the production of the linear aldehyde (butanal, or n-aldehyde) relative to the branched aldehyde (2-methylpropanal, or iso-aldehyde). The catalytic cycle involves equilibria between various 16- and 18-electron rhodium species. The regioselectivity of the reaction—the ratio of n-aldehyde to iso-aldehyde (n/iso ratio)—is highly dependent on the steric and electronic environment around the rhodium center, which is influenced by the concentrations of the ligands, including carbon monoxide (CO) and triphenylphosphine ($PPh_3$).\n\nDuring a production run, a malfunction in a pressure regulator causes the partial pressure of carbon monoxide (CO) in the reactor to increase significantly, while the partial pressure of $H_2$ and the temperature are held constant. Based on the established mechanism for this catalytic system, which of the following statements best describes the expected impact on the n/iso ratio and provides the correct underlying chemical reason?\n\nA. The n/iso ratio will decrease. This is because the higher CO concentration shifts the catalyst equilibrium towards species with more CO ligands and fewer bulky phosphine ligands (e.g., $HRh(CO)_2(PPh_3)_2$), which are less sterically demanding and thus reduce the selectivity for the linear product.\n\nB. The n/iso ratio will increase. This is because a higher CO concentration enhances the rate of CO migratory insertion, which occurs more readily for the linear rhodium-alkyl intermediate that leads to the n-aldehyde.\n\nC. The n/iso ratio will decrease. This is because excess CO acts as a catalyst poison by forming an inactive rhodium carbonyl cluster, and the formation of the branched aldehyde is kinetically favored under such inhibited conditions.\n\nD. The n/iso ratio will remain unchanged. The regioselectivity is an intrinsic property determined solely by the choice of the phosphine ligand ($PPh_3$) and is not sensitive to the partial pressure of the gaseous reactants like CO.\n\nE. The n/iso ratio will increase. According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the concentration of a reactant (CO) will push the reaction towards the products, and the linear aldehyde is the thermodynamically more stable product, thus favoring its formation.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the effect of an increased partial pressure of carbon monoxide (CO) on the regioselectivity (n/iso ratio) of the rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of propene.\n\nThe key to understanding the regioselectivity in this system lies in the steric environment of the active rhodium catalyst during the hydride insertion step, which is the regiochemistry-determining step.\n\n1.  **Catalyst Equilibria:** The catalyst precursor, $HRh(CO)(PPh_3)_3$, is an 18-electron complex. To become catalytically active, it must first dissociate a ligand to create a vacant coordination site for the alkene substrate. The most likely ligand to dissociate is one of the bulky triphenylphosphine ($PPh_3$) ligands, denoted as L.\n    $$ HRh(CO)(L)_3 \\rightleftharpoons HRh(CO)(L)_2 + L $$\n    The resulting 16-electron species, $HRh(CO)(L)_2$, is a primary active catalyst. This species exists in equilibrium with other species depending on the concentration of available ligands (CO and L). A key equilibrium involves the reaction with CO:\n    $$ HRh(CO)(L)_2 + CO \\rightleftharpoons HRh(CO)_2(L)_2 $$\n    This equilibrium is governed by the relative partial pressures (concentrations) of CO and the free phosphine ligand L.\n\n2.  **Steric Control of Regioselectivity:** The regioselectivity is determined when the hydride ($H^-$) on the rhodium center migrates to one of the two carbons of the coordinated propene double bond.\n    *   **Path to n-aldehyde (linear):** The hydride adds to the internal carbon (C2) of propene. This forms a linear rhodium-alkyl bond (at C1). This pathway is called anti-Markovnikov addition.\n    *   **Path to iso-aldehyde (branched):** The hydride adds to the terminal carbon (C1) of propene. This forms a branched rhodium-alkyl bond (at C2). This pathway is called Markovnikov addition.\n\n    The choice between these two pathways is dominated by steric interactions between the bulky phosphine ligands (L = $PPh_3$) on the rhodium center and the methyl group of the propene substrate.\n\n3.  **Effect of Low vs. High CO Pressure:**\n    *   **At low CO pressure (or high L concentration):** The equilibrium favors the species $HRh(CO)(L)_2$. This complex contains two large, bulky $PPh_3$ ligands. To minimize steric repulsion with these bulky ligands, the propene substrate orients itself such that the hydride transfer leads to the less sterically hindered linear alkyl intermediate. Therefore, low CO pressure favors the formation of the n-aldehyde, resulting in a **high n/iso ratio**.\n    *   **At high CO pressure (or low L concentration):** As the partial pressure of CO increases, the equilibrium $HRh(CO)(L)_2 + CO \\rightleftharpoons HRh(CO)_2(L)_2$ shifts to the right. The resulting species, $HRh(CO)_2(L)_2$, has more small CO ligands and fewer bulky $PPh_3$ ligands directly influencing the coordination site. For example, in a trigonal bipyramidal structure for $HRh(CO)_2(L)_2$, the two bulky $PPh_3$ ligands can occupy the axial positions, leaving the equatorial plane (where the alkene coordinates and reacts) less sterically crowded. This reduction in steric hindrance at the metal center diminishes the preference for the anti-Markovnikov hydride addition. The formation of the branched (iso) alkyl intermediate becomes more competitive. Consequently, the proportion of iso-aldehyde increases relative to the n-aldehyde, leading to a **decrease in the n/iso ratio**.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A:** This option correctly states that the n/iso ratio will decrease and provides the correct reason: the catalyst equilibrium shifts towards less sterically hindered dicarbonyl species, which reduces the steric bias that favors the linear product. This is the correct answer.\n    *   **B:** This option is incorrect. The migratory insertion of CO occurs *after* the hydride insertion step has already determined the regiochemistry (linear vs. branched alkyl). Its rate does not influence the n/iso ratio.\n    *   **C:** While it's true that very high CO pressures can inhibit or poison the catalyst, this is not the primary mechanism governing the change in *selectivity*. The change in selectivity is a more subtle effect related to the equilibrium between active species, as described in A.\n    *   **D:** This is incorrect. While the ligand's intrinsic properties are crucial, the *concentration* of ligands (both $PPh_3$ and CO) determines the composition of the active catalyst species in the equilibrium mixture and thereby its effective steric bulk and selectivity.\n    *   **E:** This is a misapplication of Le Chatelier's principle. The principle describes the response of an equilibrium to a change in conditions, but it doesn't directly predict the outcome of competing kinetic pathways (selectivity) in a complex catalytic cycle. The relative stability of the final products does not dictate the kinetically controlled regioselectivity.\n\nTherefore, the increase in CO pressure leads to a less sterically demanding catalytic environment, which in turn lowers the selectivity for the linear aldehyde, causing the n/iso ratio to decrease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2259027"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a catalytic cycle requires more than just drawing the plausible steps; it requires experimental proof to identify the slowest, or rate-determining, step.

A significant primary Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE) is observed, with the ratio $k_{H_2}/k_{D_2} = 4.1$.\n-   When using normal propene ($CH_3CH=CH_2$) with $H_2$, the rate constant is $k_{H-alkene}$. When using perdeuterated propene ($CD_3CD=CD_2$) with $H_2$, the rate constant is $k_{D-alkene}$.

A primary KIE, typically with a value greater than 2, occurs when a chemical bond to the isotopically substituted atom is broken or formed in the transition state of the rate-determining step.\n\n1.  **$H_2/D_2$ Substitution ($k_{H_2}/k_{D_2} = 4.1$):** This is a large, primary KIE. This result strongly indicates that the covalent bond in the $H_2$ molecule (the H-H bond) is being cleaved during the RDS. We must examine the proposed catalytic cycle to find the elementary step where this occurs.\n    -   Step 1: Alkene coordination, no H-H cleavage.\n    -   Step 2: Migratory insertion, an Rh-H bond is cleaved and a C-H bond is formed. No H-H cleavage.\n    -   Step 3: CO coordination, no relevant bond cleavage.\n    -   Step 4: Carbonyl insertion, an Rh-C bond is cleaved and a C-C bond is formed. No H-H cleavage.\n    -   **Step 5: Oxidative Addition, $H_2$ adds to the metal center. This step involves the cleavage of the H-H bond.**\n    -   Step 6: Reductive elimination, an Rh-H and an Rh-C bond are cleaved. No H-H cleavage.\n    Therefore, the $H_2/D_2$ KIE points directly to **Step 5** as the RDS.\n\n2.  **Alkene Isotope Substitution ($k_{H-alkene}/k_{D-alkene} = 1.05$):** This KIE is negligible (very close to 1). This tells us that no C-H (or C-D) bonds on the alkene are being broken or formed in a way that significantly affects the energy of the RDS transition state. This is fully consistent with Step 5 being the RDS. By the time Step 5 occurs, the original alkene has already been incorporated into the catalyst as an acyl group, $(CH_3CH_2CH_2CO)$. The isotopic composition of this group has no direct involvement in the oxidative addition of $H_2$ and thus does not affect the rate of this step. This observation serves to rule out other possibilities, such as C-H activation on the alkene, and strengthens the conclusion from the $H_2/D_2$ experiment.\n\nConclusion for Scenario 1: The rate-determining step is **Step 5 (Oxidative Addition)**.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario 2:**\n\nIn Scenario 2, the reaction conditions and catalyst have changed, leading to a new rate law and KIE.\n\n1.  **Rate Law Dependencies (rate $\\propto [\\text{alkene}]^0[\\text{H}_2]^0[\\text{CO}]^{-1}$):**\n    -   The zero-order dependence on $[\\text{alkene}]$ and $[\\text{H}_2]$ implies that these species are not involved in the RDS itself or in any preceding equilibrium that determines the concentration of the species reacting in the RDS. This means the steps involving them (Steps 1, 2 for alkene; Step 5 for $H_2$) are now fast relative to the new RDS.\n    -   The inverse first-order dependence on $[\\text{CO}]$ (rate $\\propto 1/[\\text{CO}]$) is a crucial piece of information. This type of kinetic behavior is characteristic of a mechanism where the reactant of the RDS, let's call it the active species $C_{active}$, is formed from a pre-equilibrium involving the dissociation of an inhibitor from a dormant or resting state of the catalyst, $C_{rest}$. Here, CO acts as the inhibitor. Given the high pressure of CO, it is plausible that the dominant catalyst species is one that has coordinated an \"extra\" molecule of CO.\n    -   Let's look at the cycle. Step 3 shows the reversible coordination of CO: $(alkyl)Rh(CO)L_2 + CO \\rightleftharpoons (alkyl)Rh(CO)_2L_2$. Under high $[\\text{CO}]$, this equilibrium will be pushed to the right, making $(alkyl)Rh(CO)_2L_2$ the most abundant catalyst intermediate (the resting state, $C_{rest}$).\n    -   The inverse order implies the active species for the RDS is formed by *loss* of CO. This means the RDS reactant is the species on the *left* of the equilibrium driven by CO. Let's assume the active catalyst path involves species $(alkyl)Rh(CO)L_2$. It can react with CO (Step 3) to form $(alkyl)Rh(CO)_2L_2$, which we assume is the dominant resting state due to high $P_{CO}$.\n    So, $[C_{rest}] = [(alkyl)Rh(CO)_2L_2]$ and $[C_{active}] = [(alkyl)Rh(CO)L_2]$.\n    $[C_{rest}] \\approx [Cat_{total}]$.\n    From Step 3 equilibrium: $$K_3 = \\frac{[C_{rest}]}{[C_{active}][\\text{CO}]}$$\n    So, $$[C_{active}] = \\frac{[C_{rest}]}{K_3 [\\text{CO}]} \\approx \\frac{[Cat_{total}]}{K_3 [\\text{CO}]}$$\n    The overall process of transforming the alkyl to the acyl species (represented by Step 4) becomes rate limiting. A standard interpretation is that Step 4, carbonyl insertion, is the RDS. For the kinetics to show an inverse dependence on CO, it implies that the insertion itself must occur from a species that is in low concentration because of a pre-equilibrium with a CO-adduct. This is a common situation in organometallic catalysis.\n\n2.  **KIE ($k_{H_2}/k_{D_2} \\approx 1.0$):** In Scenario 2, there is no KIE for $H_2/D_2$ substitution. This means the H-H bond is not being broken in the RDS. This is consistent with Step 4 (carbonyl insertion) being the RDS, because $H_2$ is not involved in this step; it only enters the cycle in the subsequent, now-fast Step 5.\n\nConclusion for Scenario 2: Combining the rate law and the KIE data, the new RDS must be a step that does not involve $H_2$ or alkene, and whose effective rate constant is inversely proportional to $[\\text{CO}]$. This points to the overall transformation of the alkyl intermediate to the acyl intermediate, which is represented by **Step 4 (Carbonyl Insertion)**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n-   RDS for Scenario 1 is **Step 5**.\n-   RDS for Scenario 2 is **Step 4**.\nThis corresponds to the pair (Step 5, Step 4).\n\nChecking the options:\nA) (Step 2, Step 6) - Incorrect.\nB) (Step 5, Step 4) - Correct.\nC) (Step 5, Step 2) - Incorrect RDS for Scenario 2.\nD) (Step 4, Step 5) - Incorrect (reversed).\nE) (Step 6, Step 4) - Incorrect RDS for Scenario 1.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2259039"}]}
