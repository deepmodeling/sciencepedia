The complex is neutral overall. We need to assign charges to the ligands to find the metal's oxidation state.\n\n-   **Cl (chloro ligand):** This is an anionic ligand, $\\text{Cl}^-$. Its charge is -1.\n-   **CO (carbonyl ligand):** This is a neutral ligand. Its charge is 0.\n-   **PPh₃ (triphenylphosphine ligand):** This is a neutral ligand. Its charge is 0.\n\nLet the oxidation state of iridium be $x$. The sum of the oxidation state of the metal and the charges of the ligands must equal the overall charge of the complex, which is 0.\n\n$$x + (\\text{charge of Cl}) + (\\text{charge of CO}) + 2 \\times (\\text{charge of PPh}_3) = 0$$\n$$x + (-1) + (0) + 2 \\times (0) = 0$$\n$$x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = +1$$\n\nSo, the formal oxidation state of iridium in Vaska's complex is +1, denoted as Ir(I).\n\nNext, we calculate the d-electron count. Iridium (Ir) is in Group 9 of the periodic table, so a neutral Ir atom has 9 valence electrons. The d-electron count for an ion is the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom minus its oxidation state.\n\n$$\\text{d-electron count} = (\\text{valence electrons of neutral Ir}) - (\\text{oxidation state})$$\n$$\\text{d-electron count} = 9 - 1 = 8$$\n\nThus, the initial state of the iridium center is **Ir(I), d⁸**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the final state (After oxidative addition of H₂)**\n\nVaska's complex reacts with $\\text{H}_2$ in an oxidative addition reaction. In this process, the $H-H$ bond is broken, and two new bonds are formed between the iridium center and each hydrogen atom. The two hydrogen atoms add as two separate hydride ligands ($\\text{H}^-$).\n\nThe reaction is:\n$\\text{trans}\\text{-[IrCl(CO)(PPh}_3)_2] + \\text{H}_2 \\rightarrow [\\text{Ir(H)}_2\\text{(Cl)(CO)(PPh}_3)_2]$\n\nThe resulting complex is $[\\text{Ir(H)}_2\\text{(Cl)(CO)(PPh}_3)_2]$, which is also neutral overall. Now we determine the new oxidation state of iridium.\n\n-   **Cl (chloro ligand):** Charge is -1.\n-   **CO (carbonyl ligand):** Charge is 0.\n-   **PPh₃ (triphenylphosphine ligand):** Charge is 0.\n-   **H (hydrido ligand):** This is an anionic ligand, $\\text{H}^-$. Its charge is -1. There are two such ligands.\n\nLet the new oxidation state of iridium be $y$.\n\n$$y + 2 \\times (\\text{charge of H}) + (\\text{charge of Cl}) + (\\text{charge of CO}) + 2 \\times (\\text{charge of PPh}_3) = 0$$\n$$y + 2 \\times (-1) + (-1) + (0) + 2 \\times (0) = 0$$\n$$y - 2 - 1 = 0 \\implies y = +3$$\n\nThe new formal oxidation state is +3, or Ir(III). The oxidation state of the metal has increased by 2, which is characteristic of oxidative addition.\n\nNow, we calculate the new d-electron count for Ir(III).\n\n$$\\text{d-electron count} = (\\text{valence electrons of neutral Ir}) - (\\text{oxidation state})$$\n$$\\text{d-electron count} = 9 - 3 = 6$$\n\nThus, the final state of the iridium center is **Ir(III), d⁶**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine results and select the correct option**\n\nThe transition is from an initial state of Ir(I), d⁸ to a final state of Ir(III), d⁶.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA. Ir(I), d⁸ $\\rightarrow$ Ir(I), d⁸ (Incorrect final state)\nB. Ir(I), d⁸ $\\rightarrow$ Ir(II), d⁷ (Incorrect final state)\nC. Ir(0), d⁹ $\\rightarrow$ Ir(II), d⁷ (Incorrect initial and final states)\nD. Ir(I), d⁸ $\\rightarrow$ Ir(III), d⁶ (Correct)\nE.

Using the ionic electron-counting method:\n- $\\text{Mn(I)}$ is $d^6$.\n- Each $\\text{CO}$ is an L-type 2-electron donor.\n- The methyl anion, $\\text{CH}_3^-$, is an X-type 2-electron donor.\n\nThus the total electron count is\n$$d^6 + 5 \\times 2 + 2 = 6 + 10 + 2 = 18.$$\n\nIn a 1,1-migratory insertion of $\\text{CO}$ into an $M-R$ bond, the alkyl group migrates onto a cis $\\text{CO}$ ligand to form an acyl ligand ($\\text{COR}$) bound through the carbonyl carbon. Two key mechanistic features apply:\n- The migrating group and the unsaturated ligand (here, $\\text{CO}$) must be cis.\n- The $M-\\text{C(acyl)}$ bond after insertion occupies the site originally held by the coordinated $\\text{CO}$, while the site formerly occupied by the alkyl group $R$ becomes vacant.\n\nCounting electrons after insertion: the pair of ligands $\\text{CO}$ (L-type, 2 electrons) and $\\text{CH}_3$ (X-type, 2 electrons) is replaced by a single acyl ligand $\\text{COCH}_3$ (X-type, 2 electrons). The number of ligands decreases by one, so the electron count drops by 2 relative to the starting 18-electron complex, giving a 16-electron, coordinatively unsaturated intermediate. With four remaining $\\text{CO}$ ligands, the electron count is\n$$d^6 + 4 \\times 2 + 2 = 6 + 8 + 2 = 16.$$\n\nRegarding geometry, because the migration requires a cis arrangement and the acyl group occupies the position of the former $\\text{CO}$, the vacancy left on the metal after insertion is at the position previously occupied by the methyl group. Therefore, the vacant site is cis to the newly formed acyl group.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A correctly describes a 16-electron $[\\text{Mn(CO)}_4(\\text{COCH}_3)]$ with a vacant site cis to the acyl.\n- B would be a trapped 18-electron species after external ligand coordination, not the coordinatively unsaturated intermediate.\n- C incorrectly places the vacancy trans to the acyl; the mechanism dictates it is cis.\n- D describes simple $\\text{CO}$ dissociation without insertion, not the specified step.\n- E is an implausible 20-electron species.\n\nHence the correct description is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2257982"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding individual mechanistic steps, it is crucial to quantify a catalyst's overall effectiveness.
