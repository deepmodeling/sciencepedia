The complex $\\text{W(CO)}_{6}$ is an $18$-electron, $d^{6}$, formally $\\text{W(0)}$ complex. Although $18$-electron complexes are often thermodynamically stable, this does not preclude nucleophilic attack at a coordinated $CO$ ligand. Coordinated carbonyl ligands possess low-lying $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals and exhibit enhanced electrophilicity at the carbon atom due to metal-to-ligand backbonding, making them susceptible to nucleophilic attack by strong nucleophiles such as $\\text{CH}_{3}^{-}$ from $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{Li}$ in ethereal solvents.\n\nAt low temperature with one equivalent of $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{Li}$, the kinetic product is formed by nucleophilic addition of $\\text{CH}_{3}^{-}$ to the carbon atom of a coordinated $CO$, converting that $CO$ into an acyl ligand.

In $\\text{Li}^+\\big[(\\text{CO})_5\\text{W}-\\text{C(O)CH}_3\\big]^-$, the anion has one $X$-type acyl ligand and five $L$-type $CO$ ligands. The net charge of the anion is $-1$. Assigning ligand charges (acyl $-1$, $CO$ neutral), the tungsten oxidation state remains $0$ (i.e., $\\text{W(0)}$) to satisfy overall charge balance, consistent with known chemistry of such anionic acylates. The valence electron count is $6$ (from $\\text{W(0)}$) $+ 10$ (from $5 \\times CO$ as $2$-electron donors) $+ 2$ (from the acyl as a $2$-electron $X$-type donor) $= 18$ electrons, which explains the observed stability of the intermediate.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A, $\\text{Li}^+[\\text{W(CO)}_5(\\text{CH}_3)]^-$, would correspond to a methyl ligand bound directly to tungsten, implying substitution of a $CO$ by $\\text{CH}_3^-$. The initial, kinetically favored pathway for strong nucleophiles is attack at a coordinated $CO$ to form an acyl, not direct $CO$ displacement to form a metal–alkyl at low temperature.

It is not the product of the initial $\\text{CH}_3^-$ attack.\n- Option D is incorrect because $18$-electron stability does not prevent nucleophilic addition to coordinated $CO$; this reaction is well documented.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the anionic acyl complex shown in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2275922"}, {"introduction": "Reductive elimination is a cornerstone of organometallic chemistry, representing a powerful method for forming new chemical bonds, particularly carbon-carbon bonds.

Here, coupling of two methyl ligands would produce ethane.
