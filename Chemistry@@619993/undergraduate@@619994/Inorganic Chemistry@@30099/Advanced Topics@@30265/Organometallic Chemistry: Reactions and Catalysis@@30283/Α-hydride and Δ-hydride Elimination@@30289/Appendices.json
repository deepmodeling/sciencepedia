The classification of the elimination (e.g., α, β, γ, δ) depends on the position of the C-H bond relative to the metal-carbon bond.\n\nConsider two distinct organometallic reaction pathways starting from different complexes, where L represents a generic spectator ligand and M is a transition metal.\n\n**Reaction 1**: An α-hydride elimination occurs in a metal-alkyl complex with the general formula $L_n\\text{M}-\\text{CHR}_2$.
