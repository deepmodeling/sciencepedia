The product 1-methoxycyclohex-2-ene is an allylic ether: the methoxy substituent is at the allylic carbon (C1) relative to a C=C located at C2–C3. A canonical way to form such allylic ethers in organometallic chemistry is by nucleophilic attack of an alkoxide on a cationic $\\eta^3$-allyl complex (Tsuji–Trost allylic substitution). Key principles:\n- A cationic metal complex renders the coordinated unsaturated hydrocarbon electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n- $\\eta^3$-allyl complexes of palladium are especially well known to undergo outer-sphere nucleophilic attack with hard nucleophiles such as alkoxides to furnish allylic ethers, with concomitant double-bond migration consistent with the allyl framework.\n- A basic, anionic nucleophile (such as methoxide) is required; neutral methanol is generally too weak to effect direct nucleophilic attack on such electrophilic ligands.\n\nApply these principles to each option:\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the need for a cationic, suitably activated unsaturated ligand and a sufficiently strong nucleophile to form an allylic ether.\n- The precursor must present an electrophilic, activated unsaturated hydrocarbon ligand.\n- The nucleophile should be an anionic alkoxide (e.g., methoxide), not neutral methanol.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option in light of established reactivity patterns.\n- Option A: The iron cyclohexadienyl tricarbonyl cation is electrophilic, but the nucleophile given is neutral methanol, which is too weak to attack efficiently. Furthermore, such systems do not selectively deliver allylic ethers under these mild conditions; methanol more often acts as solvent or proton source rather than as a productive nucleophile in direct attack. This does not reliably produce 1-methoxycyclohex-2-ene.\n- Option B: The manganese benzene tricarbonyl cation activates an arene toward nucleophilic addition, but typical outcomes are nucleophilic aromatic substitution-like additions that, upon decomplexation, favor substituted aromatics or rearomatization, not installation of an allylic ether on a cyclohexene. This does not match the target allylic ether.\n- Option C: The cationic $\\eta^3$-cyclohexenyl palladium bis(triphenylphosphine) complex is the prototypical electrophile for allylic substitution (Tsuji–Trost). Sodium methoxide is a suitable nucleophile for forming allylic ethers. Nucleophilic attack at one terminus of the allyl ligand followed by dissociation of the palladium fragment delivers the allylic ether, with placement of the C=C at C2–C3, matching 1-methoxycyclohex-2-ene. This combination directly and reliably furnishes the desired product.\n- Option D: Cationic iron $\\eta^4$-diene complexes can undergo nucleophilic additions to the coordinated diene, but such additions often give different regiochemical outcomes (e.g., addition across the diene) and may require specific conditions to control substitution versus decomplexation. They are not the standard route to simple allylic ethers like 1-methoxycyclohex-2-ene with precise regiocontrol, whereas the allyl palladium manifold is.\n- Option E: The platinum complex given is anionic and thus not electrophilic toward nucleophiles; additionally, the nucleophile is neutral methanol, which is too weak. This combination is unsuitable.\n\nStep 3: Select the most suitable pair.\nGiven the need to form an allylic ether with reliable regiocontrol and the well-established reactivity of cationic $\\eta^3$-allylpalladium complexes with alkoxides, the best choice is the cationic $\\eta^3$-cyclohexenyl palladium complex with sodium methoxide.

The complex $[(\\eta^{5}-C_{6}H_{7})Fe(CO)_{3}]^{+}$ features an $\\eta^{5}$-cyclohexadienyl ligand coordinated to iron together with three carbonyls. With a nucleophile such as $PMe_{3}$, two well-established pathways compete:\n(1) fast nucleophilic attack at the electrophilic $\\eta^{5}$-cyclohexadienyl ring (ring addition), and\n(2) ligand substitution at the metal (association followed by carbonyl dissociation).\n\nKinetic control at low temperature favors the pathway with the lowest activation barrier. In $\\eta^{5}$-cyclohexadienyl iron tricarbonyl cations, the ring is strongly electrophilic; thus $PMe_{3}$ rapidly adds to a ring carbon to give a ring-substituted complex. To preserve an $18$-electron count at iron, the hapticity of the ring decreases from $\\eta^{5}$ to $\\eta^{4}$ (“ring slippage”), producing a neutral $\\eta^{4}$-diene iron tricarbonyl:\n$$\n[(\\eta^{5}-C_{6}H_{7})Fe(CO)_{3}]^{+} + PMe_{3} \\longrightarrow (\\eta^{4}-C_{6}H_{7}PMe_{3})Fe(CO)_{3}.\n$$\nElectron-count rationale for the kinetic product: an $\\eta^{4}$-diene donates $4$ electrons and $3$ CO donate $6$ electrons; together with the metal valence electrons this fulfils the preferred $18$-electron configuration.

Phosphines are strong donors and bind strongly to iron; the thermodynamic outcome is substitution at the metal with loss of a carbonyl to restore an $18$-electron count. The sequence proceeds via initial association (formally a $20$-electron adduct) followed by CO dissociation:\n$$\n[(\\eta^{5}-C_{6}H_{7})Fe(CO)_{3}]^{+} + PMe_{3} \\rightleftharpoons [(\\eta^{5}-C_{6}H_{7})Fe(CO)_{3}(PMe_{3})]^{+}\n\\xrightarrow{-\\,CO}\n[(\\eta^{5}-C_{6}H_{7})Fe(CO)_{2}(PMe_{3})]^{+}.\n$$\nThe intermediate $[\\,\\cdot\\,]^{+}$ would be a $20$-electron species (unfavorable), so CO loss is driven both by the entropic gain from releasing CO and by formation of a strong $Fe$–$P$ bond, delivering an $18$-electron complex in which the $\\eta^{5}$-cyclohexadienyl hapticity is retained. Under thermodynamic control,\n$$\n\\text{Product T} = [(\\eta^{5}-C_{6}H_{7})Fe(CO)_{2}(PMe_{3})]^{+}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the kinetic product is the ring-addition, $\\eta^{4}$-slipped neutral complex, and the thermodynamic product is the metal-substitution cation with one CO replaced by $PMe_{3}$.

This problem [@problem_id:2274928] focuses on predicting the precise site of nucleophilic addition to an unsymmetrical ligand, methyl vinyl ketone ($CH_2=CHCOCH_3$), coordinated to an iron center. To solve this, you must analyze how metal coordination activates the ligand and apply electronic principles, closely related to the classic Michael addition, to determine the reaction's regioselectivity.", "problem": "An organometallic chemist investigates the reactivity of the cationic complex $[CpFe(CO)_2(\\eta^2-MVK)]^+$, where Cp is the cyclopentadienyl ligand ($C_5H_5^-$) and MVK is methyl vinyl ketone ($CH_2=CHCOCH_3$), coordinated to the iron center through its carbon-carbon double bond. The complex is treated with a stoichiometric amount of dimethylamine, $(CH_3)_2NH$, which acts as a nucleophile. The reaction is conducted in a polar aprotic solvent at room temperature. There are several potential sites within the complex for the nucleophilic attack to occur. Based on the principles of organometallic reactivity and electronic effects, identify the most likely primary site of attack by the nitrogen atom of dimethylamine on the cationic iron complex.\n\nWhich of the following sites will be preferentially attacked?\n\nA. The iron (Fe) metal center.\n\nB. The carbon atom of one of the terminal carbonyl (CO) ligands.\n\nC. The α-carbon of the coordinated MVK ligand (the carbon of the $CH$ group).\n\nD. The β-carbon of the coordinated MVK ligand (the carbon of the $CH_2$ group).\n\nE. The oxygen atom of the ketone functional group in the MVK ligand.", "solution": "We begin by assessing the electrophilicity and accessibility of the potential sites in $[CpFe(CO)_{2}(\\eta^{2}\\text{-}MVK)]^{+}$ toward a neutral nitrogen nucleophile, $(CH_{3})_{2}NH$, in a polar aprotic solvent.\n\nFirst, we evaluate attack at the iron center (option A). The fragment $[CpFe(CO)_{2}(\\eta^{2}\\text{-}alkene)]^{+}$ is an 18-electron complex. Based on the ionic model, the Cp⁻ ligand donates 6 electrons, the two CO ligands donate 4 electrons total, and the η²-alkene donates 2 electrons. These 12 ligand electrons combine with the 6 d-electrons from the Fe(II) center, resulting in a total of 18 electrons. Direct nucleophilic attack by $(CH_{3})_{2}NH$ at Fe would generate a 20-electron species, violating the 18-electron rule and being strongly disfavored. Moreover, the metal is cationic and relatively π-acidic rather than serving as a Lewis acidic coordination site for a neutral amine in the presence of a strongly activated, coordinated enone. Thus, A is disfavored.\n\nSecond, we consider attack at a terminal $CO$ carbon (option B). Nucleophilic attack at a metal-bound $CO$ to form a metal acyl is favored when the metal is electron rich and backbonding into $CO$ is strong, which polarizes $C\\equiv O$ to render the $C$ atom more electrophilic. In a cationic complex, metal-to-$\\pi^{*}(CO)$ backbonding is reduced, diminishing the electrophilicity of the $CO$ carbon toward nucleophilic addition. Additionally, neutral amines are only moderate nucleophiles for this transformation compared to strongly basic organometallic nucleophiles. Therefore, B is less favorable than attack at an activated coordinated alkene.\n\nThird, we analyze the coordinated MVK. Coordination of an alkene to a cationic, strongly π-acidic fragment such as $[CpFe(CO)_{2}]^{+}$ involves π donation from the alkene to the metal and π backbonding from the metal into the alkene $\\pi^{*}$ orbital. This interaction lowers the energy of the alkene $\\pi^{*}$ and increases its polarization, enhancing electrophilicity at the coordinated olefin. For an enone (MVK), frontier molecular orbital analysis shows that the $\\pi^{*}$ of the conjugated system has a larger coefficient at the β-carbon relative to the α-carbon due to conjugation with the carbonyl group. This is the same electronic basis underlying classical Michael addition: nucleophiles add preferentially at the β-carbon of an enone. Coordination to a cationic metal further activates the enone by stabilizing the developing negative charge in the conjugate addition transition state through metal-alkene interaction and by lowering the $\\pi^{*}$ energy. Consequently, outer-sphere nucleophilic attack by $(CH_{3})_{2}NH$ will preferentially occur at the β-carbon of the coordinated MVK (option D), forming a C–N bond at the β-position and an enolate-like intermediate that can remain coordinated to Fe, followed by proton transfer and eventual decoordination.\n\nAttack at the α-carbon (option C) is disfavored relative to β-attack because the LUMO coefficient at the α-carbon is smaller, and the regiochemistry of conjugate addition to enones overwhelmingly favors β-addition. Metal coordination intensifies, rather than inverts, this inherent polarization.\n\nFinally, the oxygen atom of the ketone (option E) is itself nucleophilic and not an electrophilic site for attack by a nucleophile such as $(CH_{3})_{2}NH$. While amines can add to the carbonyl carbon of free ketones under appropriate conditions, in this system the coordinated alkene is the site most strongly activated toward nucleophilic attack, and the question specifically concerns attack by nitrogen; addition to oxygen is not the operative pathway.\n\nTherefore, the most likely primary site for nucleophilic attack by the nitrogen of dimethylamine is the β-carbon of the coordinated MVK ligand.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2274928"}]}
