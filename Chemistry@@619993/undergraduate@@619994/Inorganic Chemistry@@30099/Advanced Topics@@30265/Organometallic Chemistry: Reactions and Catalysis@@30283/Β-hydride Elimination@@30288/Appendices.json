This practice focuses on the essential structural prerequisite: the presence of a β-hydrogen. By analyzing common alkyl ligands, you will develop the foundational skill of rapidly identifying which organometallic complexes are susceptible to this key decomposition pathway [@problem_id:2300449].", "problem": "In organometallic chemistry, β-hydride elimination is a crucial reaction pathway that often leads to the decomposition of catalytically active species. This process involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom from a carbon atom in the β-position of an alkyl ligand to the metal center, resulting in the formation of a metal-hydride bond and an alkene.\n\nAn organometallic chemist is synthesizing a series of complexes with a generic metal center, M, to study their thermal stability. The stability is primarily dictated by the susceptibility of the attached alkyl ligand to undergo β-hydride elimination. The chemist is considering three different alkyl ligands:\n1.  Methyl ($-\\text{CH}_3$)\n2.  Ethyl ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$)\n3.  Benzyl ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5$)\n\nAssuming the metal center M has the necessary vacant coordination site and electronic properties to facilitate the reaction, which of the following statements correctly evaluates the relative susceptibility of the M-Alkyl complexes to decomposition via β-hydride elimination?\n\nA. The complex with the ethyl ligand is susceptible, while the complexes with the methyl and benzyl ligands are both effectively inert to this specific decomposition pathway.\n\nB. The complex with the ethyl ligand is the most susceptible, followed by the benzyl complex, with the methyl complex being the least susceptible.\n\nC. The complex with the benzyl ligand is the most susceptible due to the steric bulk of the phenyl group, followed by the ethyl complex, and then the methyl complex.\n\nD. All three complexes are equally susceptible to β-hydride elimination because they are all hydrocarbon-based ligands.\n\nE. The complex with the methyl ligand is the most susceptible because its small size allows the easiest access to the metal center.", "solution": "Beta-hydride elimination from an alkyl complex requires three key conditions: (i) the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon in the beta position relative to the metal-carbon bond, (ii) a vacant coordination site on the metal cis to the alkyl ligand, and (iii) a syn-coplanar arrangement of the M, C(alpha), C(beta), and H(beta) atoms to access a four-center transition state. Under these conditions, the generic transformation can be represented as\n$$\n\\text{M-CH}_{2}\\text{-CH}_{2}\\text{R} \\xrightarrow{\\beta\\text{-H elimination}} \\text{M-H} + \\text{CH}_{2}=\\text{CHR}.\n$$\nThe problem statement specifies that the metal center M has the necessary vacant site and electronic properties, so the decisive factor is the presence or absence of a beta hydrogen on the alkyl ligand.\n\nFor the methyl ligand, $\\text{M-CH}_{3}$, the carbon bound to M is the alpha carbon and there is no beta carbon at all. Therefore, there are no beta C-H bonds. Symbolically, the count of beta hydrogens is $n_{\\beta\\text{-H}}=0$, so the beta-hydride elimination pathway is forbidden by the absence of a required beta hydrogen.\n\nFor the ethyl ligand, $\\text{M-CH}_{2}\\text{-CH}_{3}$, the alpha carbon is the methylene carbon bound to M, and the beta carbon is the terminal methyl carbon. This beta carbon bears three C-H bonds, so $n_{\\beta\\text{-H}}\\geq 1$, satisfying the requirement. The ethyl complex is thus susceptible to beta-hydride elimination, which would produce a metal hydride and ethene:\n$$\n\\text{M-CH}_{2}\\text{-CH}_{3} \\rightarrow \\text{M-H} + \\text{CH}_{2}=\\text{CH}_{2}.\n$$\n\nFor the benzyl ligand, $\\text{M-CH}_{2}\\text{-C}_{6}\\text{H}_{5}$, the alpha carbon is the benzylic $\\text{CH}_{2}$ bound to M, and the beta carbon is the ipso carbon of the phenyl ring. That ipso carbon is substituted and does not bear a hydrogen atom; hence there is no beta C-H bond. Therefore, $n_{\\beta\\text{-H}}=0$ and beta-hydride elimination is not accessible for the benzyl complex under the standard mechanism.\n\nCombining these analyses, only the ethyl complex possesses beta hydrogens and is susceptible to beta-hydride elimination, while the methyl and benzyl complexes are effectively inert to this specific pathway. This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2300449"}, {"introduction": "The presence of a β-hydrogen is necessary but not always sufficient for the reaction to proceed. This exercise explores the critical stereoelectronic requirement for β-hydride elimination: the ability to achieve a syn-coplanar arrangement of the M-C-C-H atoms. By comparing rigid and flexible cyclic ligands, you will gain insight into how geometric constraints can override simple structural predictions and dictate a complex's reactivity [@problem_id:2300424].", "problem": "A common decomposition pathway for organometallic alkyl complexes is β-hydride elimination. This intramolecular reaction involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom from a carbon atom in the β-position relative to the metal center, forming a metal-hydride bond and an alkene. A critical geometric prerequisite for this process is that the metal center (M), the α-carbon (Cα), the β-carbon (Cβ), and the β-hydrogen (Hβ) must be able to achieve a syn-coplanar arrangement. This conformation corresponds to an M-Cα-Cβ-Hβ dihedral angle of approximately 0°.\n\nConsider two related complexes: a generic late-transition metal complex with a cyclopropyl ligand, $[\\text{M}]-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_2)_2$, and an analogous complex with a cyclobutyl ligand, $[\\text{M}]-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_2)_3$. It is observed experimentally that the cyclopropyl complex is remarkably stable and does not undergo β-hydride elimination, whereas the cyclobutyl complex undergoes β-hydride elimination, although at a much slower rate than a comparable acyclic ethyl complex.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this difference in reactivity?\n\nA. The C-H bonds on the β-carbons of the cyclopropyl ring are significantly stronger than those on the cyclobutyl ring due to increased s-character, making them kinetically inert.\n\nB. The rigid, triangular geometry of the cyclopropyl ring fixes the M-Cα-Cβ-Hβ dihedral angle far from the required 0°, making the syn-coplanar transition state geometrically inaccessible. The more flexible cyclobutyl ring can pucker to approach this geometry, but doing so induces significant strain.\n\nC. The cyclobutyl complex readily undergoes β-hydride elimination to form the highly stable cyclobutene, which relieves the ring strain of the four-membered ring.\n\nD. The metal center in the cyclopropyl complex is electronically deactivated for β-hydride elimination because the cyclopropyl group acts as a strong π-acceptor ligand.\n\nE. β-hydride elimination is energetically favorable for both systems, but the cyclopropyl complex is stabilized by a strong agostic interaction with a γ-hydrogen, which prevents the β-hydrogen from approaching the metal.", "solution": "The elementary step of a $\\beta$-hydride elimination proceeds through a concerted, four-center transition state that requires a syn-coplanar arrangement of the atoms $\\mathrm{M}$, $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$, $\\mathrm{C_{\\beta}}$, and $\\mathrm{H_{\\beta}}$. Denoting the dihedral angle by $\\phi = \\angle(\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}-\\mathrm{C_{\\beta}}-\\mathrm{H_{\\beta}})$, the stereoelectronic requirement for productive overlap is $\\phi \\approx 0^{\\circ}$. This enables donation from the $\\sigma(\\mathrm{C_{\\beta}-H_{\\beta}})$ orbital into an empty metal orbital while simultaneously forming $\\mathrm{M}$–$\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}{=}\\mathrm{C_{\\beta}}$.\n\nFor the cyclopropyl complex $\\left[\\mathrm{M}\\right]-\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{CH_{2}})_{2}$, the $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$ atom is a vertex of a three-membered ring. The cyclopropyl framework possesses a rigid, nearly planar triangular geometry with severe constraints: rotation about the $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\beta}}$ bond is essentially prohibited, and the $\\mathrm{C_{\\beta}-H_{\\beta}}$ bonds are oriented largely out of the ring plane due to the bent-bond (Walsh) character of the ring. The $\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$ bond lies approximately in the ring plane, so placing any $\\mathrm{H_{\\beta}}$ into the same plane to achieve $\\phi \\approx 0^{\\circ}$ is geometrically inaccessible without breaking or severely distorting the three-membered ring. Thus, the syn-coplanar transition state cannot be reached, and $\\beta$-hydride elimination is effectively prevented.\n\nFor the cyclobutyl complex $\\left[\\mathrm{M}\\right]-\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{CH_{2}})_{3}$, the four-membered ring is strained but conformationally more flexible. The ring can pucker (butterfly/envelope conformations), which allows modulation of the dihedral $\\phi$ by deforming the $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\beta}}$ segment and reorienting a $\\mathrm{C_{\\beta}-H_{\\beta}}$ bond toward coplanarity with $\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$. Approaching $\\phi \\approx 0^{\\circ}$ is therefore possible, but it incurs additional angle and torsional strain in the ring. Consequently, the transition state is accessible but higher in energy than in an acyclic system where free rotation readily achieves $\\phi = 0^{\\circ}$. This explains why the cyclobutyl complex undergoes $\\beta$-hydride elimination, but more slowly than a comparable acyclic ethyl complex.\n\nThese geometric and stereoelectronic considerations directly address the observed reactivity difference. The alternative statements are less accurate for the following reasons: (i) invoking stronger $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ bonds on $\\beta$-carbons (option A) is not the fundamental kinetic determinant, since the concerted elimination barrier is governed by alignment and orbital overlap rather than simple bond dissociation energies; (ii) claiming facile strain relief to a “highly stable” cyclobutene (option C) contradicts the observed slower rate and overstates the thermodynamic driving force, as cyclobutene remains strained; (iii) suggesting strong $\\pi$-acceptor behavior of cyclopropyl (option D) is incorrect for its electronic character; and (iv) proposing a blocking $\\gamma$-agostic interaction (option E) is not the general or primary reason for the suppression observed in cyclopropyl complexes.
