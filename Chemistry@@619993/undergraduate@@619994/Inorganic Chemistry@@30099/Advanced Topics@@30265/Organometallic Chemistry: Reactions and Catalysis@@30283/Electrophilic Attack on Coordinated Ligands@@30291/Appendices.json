In organometallic complexes with multiple potential points of attack, understanding the electronic distribution across the ligands is key. This exercise [@problem_id:2250431] provides a classic case of intramolecular selectivity, challenging you to use formal ligand assignments based on aromaticity to determine which of two different cyclic ligands in a mixed-sandwich complex is more nucleophilic and therefore more susceptible to electrophilic attack.", "problem": "Consider the stable, yet paramagnetic, mixed-sandwich organometallic complex, $(\\eta^5-C_5H_5)V(\\eta^7-C_7H_7)$. In organometallic chemistry, the electronic properties and reactivity of such complexes are often analyzed by considering the formal charges of the ligands that would render them aromatic. For the ligands in this complex, these are the $6\\pi$-electron cyclopentadienyl anion ($C_5H_5^-$) and the $6\\pi$-electron tropylium cation ($C_7H_7^+$). An electrophile is a chemical species that is attracted to electron-rich centers and participates in reactions by accepting an electron pair.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the site of electrophilic attack (e.g., Friedel-Crafts acylation) on the $(\\eta^5-C_5H_5)V(\\eta^7-C_7H_7)$ complex?\n\nA. The $\\eta^7-C_7H_7$ ring is more susceptible to attack because it is a larger ring system and its interaction with the metal's d-orbitals makes it more electron-rich.\n\nB. Both rings are equally susceptible to attack because the central vanadium atom facilitates complete delocalization of charge between the two rings, resulting in identical electron density.\n\nC. The $\\eta^5-C_5H_5$ ring is more susceptible to attack because the formal description of the ligands as $C_5H_5^-$ and $C_7H_7^+$ implies that the cyclopentadienyl ring is the more nucleophilic of the two.\n\nD. The $\\eta^7-C_7H_7$ ring is more susceptible to attack. Since it is formally a cation, it is a strong $\\pi$-acceptor, and the vanadium atom will heavily donate electron density into its antibonding orbitals, making it the most electron-rich ring.\n\nE. Neither ring will undergo electrophilic attack, as the paramagnetic nature of the complex means the unpaired electron at the metal center is the most reactive site.", "solution": "We first assign the formal charges to the ligands that render them aromatic. The cyclopentadienyl ring is described as $C_{5}H_{5}^{-}$ (a $6\\pi$-electron aromatic anion) and the tropylium ring as $C_{7}H_{7}^{+}$ (a $6\\pi$-electron aromatic cation). Denote their formal charges as $q_{\\text{Cp}}=-1$ and $q_{\\text{Tr}}=+1$.\n\nFor the neutral complex $(\\eta^5-C_5H_5)V(\\eta^7-C_7H_7)$, overall charge conservation gives\n$$q_{\\text{complex}}=0=q_{\\text{V}}+q_{\\text{Cp}}+q_{\\text{Tr}},$$\nso\n$$q_{\\text{V}}=0.$$\nThus, the vanadium oxidation state is zero.\n\nNext, we perform electron counting to confirm the paramagnetism and assess bonding. Let $g$ be the group number of vanadium, so $g=5$. The $\\eta^5-C_5H_5^-$ donates $6$ electrons and the $\\eta^7-C_7H_7^+$ donates $6$ electrons as well. The valence electron count is\n$$VE=g+6+6=5+6+6=17,$$\nwhich predicts a $17$-electron, paramagnetic complex, consistent with the statement.\n\nNow, we analyze relative electron density at the two rings to predict the site of electrophilic attack by an electrophile $E^{+}$. The $C_{5}H_{5}^{-}$ ligand is a strong $\\pi$-donor and is formally an anion, so it carries excess electron density. The $C_{7}H_{7}^{+}$ ligand is a $\\pi$-acceptor and is formally a cation, so it is electron-deficient. Even allowing for metal-to-ligand backbonding, the cationic tropylium ring remains the more electron-poor ring relative to the anionic cyclopentadienyl ring. Therefore, the inequality in electron densities at the ring carbons can be expressed qualitatively as\n$$\\rho_{\\text{Cp}}>\\rho_{\\text{Tr}},$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\text{Cp}}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{Tr}}$ denote the electron densities at the cyclopentadienyl and tropylium rings, respectively.\n\nElectrophilic aromatic substitution proceeds at the most electron-rich site. Hence, $E^{+}$ will preferentially attack the $\\eta^5-C_5H_5$ ring rather than the $\\eta^7-C_7H_7$ ring.\n\nThis reasoning directly supports the statement that the cyclopentadienyl ring is more nucleophilic due to its formal anionic character and stronger $\\pi$-donor nature, whereas the tropylium ring is comparatively electron-poor and $\\pi$-accepting. Therefore, among the options, the statement that uses the formal $C_{5}H_{5}^{-}$ and $C_{7}H_{7}^{+}$ description to identify the cyclopentadienyl ring as the preferred site for electrophilic attack is the most accurate. Options asserting equal susceptibility or enhanced reactivity at the tropylium ring due to size or backdonation overlook the intrinsic electron-withdrawing character of the $C_{7}H_{7}^{+}$ ligand, and paramagnetism does not preclude electrophilic substitution at the ring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2250431"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying *where* a reaction occurs, it is crucial to understand the factors that govern *how fast* it proceeds. This practice [@problem_id:2250437] explores the relative reactivity of a homologous series of metallocenes toward electrophilic acylation. By comparing ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, you will investigate how periodic trends, specifically the increasing metal-ligand bond strength down a group, influence the stability of the reaction intermediate and, consequently, the overall rate of electrophilic substitution.", "problem": "The group 8 metallocenes, ferrocene ($(\\eta^5-C_5H_5)_2Fe$), ruthenocene ($(\\eta^5-C_5H_5)_2Ru$), and osmocene ($(\\eta^5-C_5H_5)_2Os$), are known for their rich aromatic-like chemistry. They readily undergo electrophilic substitution reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts acylation, on their cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings.\n\nConsider the relative rates of acylation for this series of compounds under identical reaction conditions. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the order of reactivity and provides the best chemical reasoning for this trend?\n\nA. Ferrocene > Ruthenocene > Osmocene. This is because the Metal-Cp bond strength increases down the group (Fe < Ru < Os). The stronger bond in osmocene makes the structural distortion required to stabilize the cationic reaction intermediate energetically less favorable, thus slowing the reaction.\n\nB. Osmocene > Ruthenocene > Ferrocene. This is because the polarizability and electron-donating ability of the metal center increase down the group, making the Cp rings more nucleophilic and thus more reactive towards electrophiles.\n\nC. Ferrocene > Ruthenocene > Osmocene. This is because the electronegativity of the metal increases down the group (Fe > Ru > Os), leading to greater net electron withdrawal from the Cp rings and deactivating them for heavier metals.\n\nD. The rates are approximately equal (Ferrocene ≈ Ruthenocene ≈ Osmocene). This is because the chemistry is dominated by the cyclopentadienyl rings, which are identical in all three complexes, and the central metal has a negligible effect on the ring's reactivity.", "solution": "We analyze the electrophilic substitution (acylation) of group 8 metallocenes on their cyclopentadienyl rings. The general mechanism is analogous to aromatic electrophilic substitution and proceeds through a cationic, Wheland-type intermediate on the Cp ring. In metallocenes, stabilization of this intermediate requires structural distortion of the sandwich complex, typically involving a change in hapticity (ring slippage, e.g., partial change from $\\eta^{5}$ coordination), and redistribution of electron density between the metal and the Cp ring to delocalize positive charge. Consequently, the rate depends on how easily the metallocene framework can undergo the required distortion and how effectively the metal can stabilize the developing cationic character.\n\nKey principle: The energetic cost to reach the cationic intermediate correlates with the strength and rigidity of the metal–Cp interaction. Stronger metal–Cp bonding disfavors the structural relaxation (ring slippage and bond reorganization) needed to stabilize the intermediate, increasing the activation barrier and decreasing the rate.\n\nPeriodic trend: Down group 8 from Fe to Ru to Os, metal–Cp bonding generally becomes stronger and more covalent due to the greater radial extension and better overlap of the $4d$ and $5d$ orbitals with the Cp $\\pi$ system, as well as lower $d$-orbital energies that increase metal–ligand bonding. This increased bond strength and rigidity makes ring slippage more energetically costly for ruthenocene than ferrocene, and even more so for osmocene. Therefore, the rate of electrophilic substitution decreases down the group:\nFerrocene reacts fastest, then ruthenocene, then osmocene.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- Option A states the order Ferrocene $>$ Ruthenocene $>$ Osmocene and attributes it to increasing metal–Cp bond strength down the group, making the distortion to stabilize the cationic intermediate less favorable for heavier congeners. This aligns with the mechanistic rationale above.\n- Option B reverses the order and invokes increased polarizability and electron donation down the group to enhance nucleophilicity. This contradicts the observed decrease in reactivity and overlooks the dominant effect of increased bond strength and reduced ease of ring slippage in $4d/5d$ metallocenes.\n- Option C gives the correct order but provides an incorrect rationale: it claims electronegativity increases as Fe $>$ Ru $>$ Os and that electron withdrawal increases down the group. The stated electronegativity trend is incorrect and does not appropriately explain the observed reactivity.\n- Option D claims similar rates because the Cp ligands are identical. This ignores the critical role of the metal in stabilizing the intermediate and in controlling the ease of ring slippage, which significantly impacts the rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2250437"}, {"introduction": "A powerful concept in coordination chemistry is the ability of a metal center to actively control the reactivity of its ligands.

No reaction occurs in either case because the coordinated DMSO ligand is electronically deactivated and non-nucleophilic.", "solution": "Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is ambidentate and can coordinate through sulfur or oxygen. The site of coordination to a metal center alters the polarization of the $S=O$ bond and thereby inverts the relative nucleophilicity of S and O at the unbound atom. Methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate provides the strong electrophile $CH_3^+$, which attacks the more nucleophilic, noncoordinated site of the coordinated DMSO. After alkylation, the modified organic ligand is displaced, giving a free organic cation characteristic of the alkylation site.\n\nPrinciple: By the HSAB concept, soft acids favor binding to soft bases, and hard acids favor binding to hard bases. Pt(II) is a soft acid and binds DMSO through S; Al(III) is a hard acid and binds DMSO through O. Coordination through one atom decreases its nucleophilicity and increases the nucleophilicity at the other atom via polarization of the $S=O$ bond (often represented by the resonance form $R_2S^{+}-O^{-}$).\n\nFor Complex A, $[PtCl_3(DMSO)]^-$: Pt(II) is soft, so DMSO is S-bound. S coordination diminishes sulfur nucleophilicity and enhances the negative character at oxygen. Therefore $CH_3^+$ attacks oxygen, giving O-methylation. O-methylation of DMSO affords the methoxydimethylsulfonium cation, written as $[(CH_3)_2S(OCH_3)]^+$.\n\nFor Complex B, $[AlCl_5(DMSO)]^{2-}$: Al(III) is hard, so DMSO is O-bound.

S-methylation of DMSO affords the trimethylsulfoxonium cation, written as $[(CH_3)_3SO]^+$.\n\nThus, Complex A yields the methoxydimethylsulfonium ion and Complex B yields the trimethylsulfoxonium ion, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2250454"}]}
