In this model, we assign standard charges to the ligands to deduce the charge (oxidation state) of the central metal atom required to balance the overall charge of the complex.\n\nFirst, let's establish the oxidation state of the starting active catalyst, $cis\\text{-}[\\text{Rh(CO)}_2\\text{I}_2]^-$. The overall charge of the complex is -1. Carbonyl ligands (CO) are neutral, so they are assigned a charge of 0. Iodide ligands (I) are halides, so they are assigned a charge of -1 each. Let the oxidation state of rhodium be $x$.\nThe sum of the oxidation states must equal the overall charge of the complex:\n$x + 2 \\times (0)_{\\text{for CO}} + 2 \\times (-1)_{\\text{for I}} = -1$\n$x + 0 - 2 = -1$\n$x = +1$\nSo, the starting catalyst contains Rh(I).\n\n**Step 1: Oxidation state in Species A (after Oxidative Addition)**\nThe reaction is the oxidative addition of $\\text{CH}_3\\text{I}$ to $[\\text{Rh(CO)}_2\\text{I}_2]^-$. In this process, the $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-I}$ bond is broken, and both the methyl group ($\\text{CH}_3$) and the iodide (I) formally add to the metal center.\nThe resulting complex, **Species A**, has the formula $[\\text{Rh(CH}_3)(\\text{CO})_2\\text{I}_3]^-$.\nThe overall charge of Species A is still -1. The ligands are one methyl group, two carbonyls, and three iodides. In the ionic model, the methyl group is treated as the methyl anion, $\\text{CH}_3^-$, with a charge of -1. Carbonyls are neutral (0), and iodides are -1.\nLet the oxidation state of Rh in Species A be $x_A$.\n$x_A + 1 \\times (-1)_{\\text{for CH}_3} + 2 \\times (0)_{\\text{for CO}} + 3 \\times (-1)_{\\text{for I}} = -1$\n$x_A - 1 + 0 - 3 = -1$\n$x_A - 4 = -1$\n$x_A = +3$\nThe oxidation state of rhodium in Species A is +3. This is consistent with the definition of oxidative addition, which increases the metal's oxidation state by two units (from +1 to +3).\n\n**Step 2: Oxidation state in Species B (after Migratory Insertion)**\nSpecies A, $[\\text{Rh(CH}_3)(\\text{CO})_2\\text{I}_3]^-$, undergoes migratory insertion to form Species B. The methyl group migrates to a carbonyl ligand, forming a single acetyl ligand ($-\\text{COCH}_3$). The complex becomes $[\\text{Rh(COCH}_3)(\\text{CO})\\text{I}_3]^-$.\nThe overall charge of Species B remains -1. The ligands are now one acetyl group, one carbonyl, and three iodides. The acetyl group is treated as the acetyl anion, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}^-$, with a charge of -1.\nLet the oxidation state of Rh in Species B be $x_B$.\n$x_B + 1 \\times (-1)_{\\text{for COCH}_3} + 1 \\times (0)_{\\text{for CO}} + 3 \\times (-1)_{\\text{for I}} = -1$\n$x_B - 1 + 0 - 3 = -1$\n$x_B - 4 = -1$\n$x_B = +3$\nThe oxidation state of rhodium in Species B is +3. Migratory insertion is an intramolecular process that does not change the formal oxidation state of the metal center.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation state in the regenerated catalyst**\nThe problem asks for the oxidation state of the rhodium in the regenerated catalyst, $[\\text{Rh(CO)}_2\\text{I}_2]^-$. As we calculated at the very beginning, the oxidation state of rhodium in this complex is +1. The process of reductive elimination, which precedes the regeneration, causes the oxidation state of the metal to decrease by two units (from +3 back to +1).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sequence of oxidation states for the rhodium center in Species A, Species B, and the regenerated catalyst $[\\text{Rh(CO)}_2\\text{I}_2]^-$ is (+3, +3, +1).
