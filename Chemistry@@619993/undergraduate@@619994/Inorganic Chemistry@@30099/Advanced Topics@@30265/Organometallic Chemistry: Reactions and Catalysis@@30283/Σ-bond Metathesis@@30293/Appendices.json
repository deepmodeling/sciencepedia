The reaction is a σ-bond metathesis, which proceeds via elimination of $\\text{H}_2$. There are two possible pathways, one involving the S-H bond and the other involving the O-H bond.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction pathways**\nThe two possible reactions are:\n1.  Reaction at the thiol group (S-H):\n    $(\\text{Cp}^*)_2\\text{Lu-H} + \\text{H-SCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} \\rightarrow (\\text{Cp}^*)_2\\text{Lu}(\\text{SCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}) + \\text{H}_2$\n    This forms the thiolate, **Product A**.\n\n2.

The rate of a σ-bond metathesis reaction involving a metal hydride and a protic substrate is highly dependent on the acidity of the proton being transferred. The reaction proceeds through a four-centered transition state, and the cleavage of the E-H bond (where E = S or O) is a key part of the rate-determining step. A more acidic proton will lead to a lower activation energy and thus a faster reaction rate.\n\nWe are given the $p\\text{K}_a$ values:\n- $p\\text{K}_a(\\text{R-SH}) \\approx 10$\n- $p\\text{K}_a(\\text{R-OH}) \\approx 16$\n\nSince a lower $p\\text{K}_a$ value corresponds to a higher acidity, the thiol group (S-H) is significantly more acidic than the alcohol group (O-H). Therefore, the protonolysis of the Lu-H bond by the S-H group will be kinetically favored. The reaction will proceed much faster via pathway 1.\n\nThe major product formed under kinetic control (low temperature, short reaction time) will be the one resulting from the reaction at the more acidic site.\nKinetic Product (K) = $(\\text{Cp}^*)_2\\text{Lu}(\\text{SCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH})$ = **Product A**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the thermodynamic product**\nThe thermodynamic product is the most stable product, which corresponds to the overall most favorable change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction. In this type of reaction, the main factor determining the relative stability of the products is the strength of the new metal-element bond that is formed (Lu-S vs. Lu-O).\n\nWe are given two key pieces of information:\n1.  Lutetium(III) is a hard Lewis acid.\n2.  The Lu-O bond is substantially more stable than the Lu-S bond.\n\nThis is consistent with the Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) principle. The $\\text{Lu}^{3+}$ center is a hard acid. The oxygen donor in the alkoxide ($\\text{RO}^-$) is a hard base, while the sulfur donor in the thiolate ($\\text{RS}^-$) is a soft base. Hard-hard interactions are more favorable and lead to stronger, more stable bonds than hard-soft interactions.\n\nTherefore, the alkoxide complex, $(\\text{Cp}^*)_2\\text{Lu}(\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{SH})$, is thermodynamically more stable than the thiolate complex, $(\\text{Cp}^*)_2\\text{Lu}(\\text{SCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH})$. Over time and with sufficient thermal energy (higher temperature), the initially formed kinetic product can rearrange to the more stable thermodynamic product.\n\nThe major product formed under thermodynamic control (equilibrium conditions) will be the most stable species.\nThermodynamic Product (T) = $(\\text{Cp}^*)_2\\text{Lu}(\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{SH})$ = **Product B**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and select the correct option**\nWe have determined:\n- Kinetic Product (K) = Product A\n- Thermodynamic Product (T) = Product B\n\nThis corresponds to the pair (K = Product A, T = Product B).
