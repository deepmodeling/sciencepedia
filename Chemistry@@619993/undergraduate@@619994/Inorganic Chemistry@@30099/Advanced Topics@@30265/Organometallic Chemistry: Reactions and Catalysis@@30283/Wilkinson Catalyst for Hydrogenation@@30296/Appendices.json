In this scenario [@problem_id:2299130], a seemingly simple change of solvent brings the powerful Wilkinson catalyst, $RhCl(PPh_3)_3$, to a halt. By diagnosing the mechanistic reason for this inhibition, you will learn to think critically about how solvent choice and other external factors can intercept key catalytic intermediates and disrupt a reaction pathway.", "problem": "Wilkinson's catalyst, chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium(I) ($RhCl(PPh_3)_3$), is a highly effective homogeneous catalyst for the hydrogenation of alkenes. The widely accepted mechanism in a non-coordinating solvent like benzene involves the initial dissociation of a triphenylphosphine ($PPh_3$) ligand to generate a coordinatively unsaturated 14-electron species, $RhCl(PPh_3)_2$. This active species then proceeds through a cycle of oxidative addition of $H_2$, alkene coordination, migratory insertion, and reductive elimination to yield the alkane and regenerate the catalyst.\n\nAn experiment is conducted to compare the rate of hydrogenation of 1-hexene. In one trial, benzene is used as the solvent, and the reaction proceeds rapidly. In a second trial, all conditions are kept identical, but the solvent is replaced with pyridine. In this case, the rate of hydrogenation is observed to be drastically inhibited, falling to nearly zero.\n\nBased on the principles of organometallic chemistry and catalytic cycles, which of the following statements provides the most accurate mechanistic explanation for the observed inhibition by pyridine?\n\nA. Pyridine, being a strong Lewis base and present in high concentration as the solvent, coordinates to the 14-electron intermediate $RhCl(PPh_3)_2$ to form a stable, 16-electron square planar complex, $RhCl(PPh_3)_2(py)$, which is reluctant to participate in the subsequent oxidative addition of $H_2$.\n\nB. Pyridine is a strong enough ligand to cause the complete dissociation of all three $PPh_3$ ligands from the rhodium center, leading to the formation of a catalytically inert species, $[RhCl(py)_3]$.\n\nC. The aromatic ring of pyridine undergoes a Friedel-Crafts-type alkylation reaction with the 1-hexene substrate, catalyzed by the rhodium complex. This side reaction consumes the alkene, preventing it from being hydrogenated.\n\nD. The pyridine ligand coordinates to the rhodium center, but due to its smaller size compared to $PPh_3$, it enhances the rate of oxidative addition of $H_2$. The resulting 18-electron dihydrido complex is so stable that the final reductive elimination step is completely blocked.\n\nE. Pyridine acts as a pi-acceptor ligand that withdraws electron density from the Rh(I) center, making the metal too electron-poor to undergo the necessary oxidative addition of $H_2$, a step which requires an electron-rich metal center.\n\nF. The nitrogen atom in pyridine is sufficiently basic to deprotonate the 1-hexene substrate, forming a carbanion that is unreactive toward the catalyst.", "solution": "The problem asks for the mechanistic reason behind the severe inhibition of Wilkinson's-catalyzed hydrogenation when pyridine is used as a solvent instead of a non-coordinating solvent like benzene. To solve this, we must analyze the standard catalytic cycle and consider how a strongly coordinating solvent like pyridine could interfere with it.\n\nFirst, let's outline the key steps of the established catalytic cycle for hydrogenation using $RhCl(PPh_3)_3$ in a non-coordinating solvent:\n\n1.  **Pre-equilibrium (Catalyst Activation):** The 16-electron pre-catalyst $RhCl(PPh_3)_3$ must first dissociate one bulky $PPh_3$ ligand to open up a coordination site. This forms the true active catalyst, the T-shaped, 14-electron species $RhCl(PPh_3)_2$.\n    $$RhCl(PPh_3)_3 \\rightleftharpoons RhCl(PPh_3)_2 + PPh_3$$\n    This 14-electron species is highly reactive because it is coordinatively and electronically unsaturated.\n\n2.  **Oxidative Addition:** The active catalyst reacts with dihydrogen ($H_2$) in an oxidative addition step. The oxidation state of rhodium changes from +1 to +3, and the electron count increases from 14 to 16.\n    $$RhCl(PPh_3)_2 + H_2 \\rightarrow H_2RhCl(PPh_3)_2$$\n\n3.  **Substrate Coordination:** The alkene substrate coordinates to the 16-electron dihydrido complex. This step is typically reversible.\n    $$H_2RhCl(PPh_3)_2 + \\text{alkene} \\rightleftharpoons H_2RhCl(PPh_3)_2(\\text{alkene})$$\n\n4.  **Migratory Insertion:** One of the hydride ligands migrates to one of the alkene's carbon atoms, forming a rhodium-alkyl bond. This is an intramolecular process.\n    $$H_2RhCl(PPh_3)_2(\\text{alkene}) \\rightarrow HRhCl(PPh_3)_2(\\text{alkyl})$$\n\n5.  **Reductive Elimination:** The remaining hydride ligand and the alkyl group couple and are eliminated from the metal center as the final alkane product. This step regenerates the 14-electron active catalyst, $RhCl(PPh_3)_2$, allowing the cycle to continue.\n    $$HRhCl(PPh_3)_2(\\text{alkyl}) \\rightarrow RhCl(PPh_3)_2 + \\text{alkane}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of using pyridine as the solvent. Pyridine is a small molecule with a lone pair on the nitrogen atom, making it an excellent Lewis base and a strong coordinating ligand. Since it is the solvent, its concentration is extremely high compared to the catalyst and the substrates ($H_2$ and 1-hexene).\n\nThe crucial point of intervention is at the very first step of the catalytic cycle proper, involving the highly reactive 14-electron intermediate, $RhCl(PPh_3)_2$. This species is desperate for electron density and an open coordination site. In the absence of a coordinating solvent, it will react with $H_2$ or the alkene. However, in a pyridine solution, it is overwhelmingly more likely to encounter and react with a pyridine molecule.\n\n$$RhCl(PPh_3)_2 + py \\rightleftharpoons RhCl(PPh_3)_2(py)$$\n\nThis reaction forms $RhCl(PPh_3)_2(py)$, a 16-electron, square planar complex. This species is coordinatively saturated (for a $d^8$ metal like Rh(I)) and electronically stable. The equilibrium for this reaction lies far to the right because pyridine is both a strong ligand and is present in vast excess. This complex is often called a \"catalyst resting state\" or, more accurately in this case, a \"poisoned\" or \"inhibited\" state. Because this 16-electron complex is stable, it does not readily dissociate the pyridine ligand to open a site for $H_2$ to add. The catalytic cycle is effectively shut down because the concentration of the necessary active species, $RhCl(PPh_3)_2$, is reduced to a negligible level.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A:** This statement accurately describes the situation. Pyridine coordinates to the 14-electron intermediate, forming a stable 16-electron adduct that is unreactive towards $H_2$. This sequesters the active catalyst and halts the cycle. This is the correct explanation.\n\n*   **B:** While pyridine is a strong ligand, it is not strong enough to displace all three bulky and reasonably strongly-bound $PPh_3$ ligands. The inhibition mechanism is one of competitive coordination with the active intermediate, not wholesale ligand substitution on the pre-catalyst.\n\n*   **C:** Friedel-Crafts reactions are characteristic of electrophilic aromatic substitution and typically require a strong Lewis acid catalyst (like $AlCl_3$) and an activated aromatic ring. This type of reaction is irrelevant to the conditions of homogeneous hydrogenation.\n\n*   **D:** This option suggests pyridine accelerates oxidative addition but blocks reductive elimination. This is incorrect. A coordinating solvent would generally compete for the coordination site needed for $H_2$ addition, thus slowing it down, not accelerating it. The primary effect is blockage at the very start of the cycle.\n\n*   **E:** Pyridine is primarily a sigma-donor ligand, not a strong pi-acceptor. Ligands like CO or $NO^+$ are strong pi-acceptors. Pyridine's sigma-donation actually increases the electron density on the metal center. Therefore, the premise that it makes the metal too electron-poor is incorrect. In fact, more electron density should favor oxidative addition, but the site is blocked.\n\n*   **F:** Pyridine is a base, but it is not nearly strong enough to deprotonate a non-activated alkene like 1-hexene. This option is chemically implausible.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that pyridine poisons the catalyst by forming a stable, unreactive adduct with the active 14-electron species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2299130"}, {"introduction": "Modern catalysis has moved beyond discovery to rational design, where a catalyst's properties can be precisely tuned.
