The electron configuration is built upon the preceding noble gas, Xenon (Xe, $Z=54$). A neutral Gd atom has $64 - 54 = 10$ valence electrons to be placed in the 4f, 5d, and 6s orbitals. The aufbau principle predicts the filling order. However, Gadolinium is a known exception, favoring a half-filled 4f subshell for added stability. Instead of [Xe] 4f⁸ 6s², its configuration is [Xe] 4f⁷ 5d¹ 6s².\n\nStep 2: Determine the ground-state electron configuration of the $Gd^{3+}$ ion.\nTo form the $Gd^{3+}$ ion, we must remove three electrons from the neutral Gd atom. Electrons are removed from the orbitals with the highest principal quantum number first. In this case, we remove the two 6s electrons and the one 5d electron.\n- Removing the two 6s electrons from Gd ([Xe] 4f⁷ 5d¹ 6s²) gives $Gd^{2+}$ with the configuration [Xe] 4f⁷ 5d¹.\n- Removing the one 5d electron from $Gd^{2+}$ gives $Gd^{3+}$ with the configuration [Xe] 4f⁷.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of unpaired electrons ($n$) in the $Gd^{3+}$ ion.\nThe electron configuration of $Gd^{3+}$ is [Xe] 4f⁷. The f subshell has 7 orbitals. According to Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, electrons will occupy separate orbitals with parallel spins before any pairing occurs. Since there are 7 electrons and 7 f-orbitals, each orbital will be occupied by a single electron.\n- Orbital 1: ↑\n- Orbital 2: ↑\n- Orbital 3: ↑\n- Orbital 4: ↑\n- Orbital 5: ↑\n- Orbital 6: ↑\n- Orbital 7: ↑\nAll 7 electrons are in separate orbitals and are therefore unpaired.\nThus, the number of unpaired electrons is $n=7$.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the spin-only magnetic moment ($\\mu_{so}$).\nThe formula for the spin-only magnetic moment is given as $\\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}$, with the unit being the Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$).\nWe substitute the value $n=7$ into the formula:\n$$ \\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{7(7+2)} $$\n$$ \\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{7(9)} $$\n$$ \\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{63} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value and round it to three significant figures as requested.\n$$ \\mu_{so} \\approx 7.93725... \\, \\mu_B $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$ \\mu_{so} \\approx 7.94 \\, \\mu_B $$\n\nThe two values requested are the number of unpaired electrons, $n=7$, and the spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_{so} = 7.94 \\, \\mu_B$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 7 & 7.94 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2263551"}, {"introduction": "One of the defining features of the f-block is the lanthanide contraction, a steady decrease in ionic size across the series that has profound chemical consequences. This exercise challenges you to apply this principle to predict a trend in the chemical properties of lanthanide compounds. By comparing the basicity of hydroxides from the beginning, middle, and end of the series, you will see how this subtle structural change governs reactivity [@problem_id:2263571].", "problem": "The lanthanide series of elements, which spans from Lanthanum (La) to Lutetium (Lu), is characterized by the filling of the 4f orbitals. This leads to a systematic trend in their physical and chemical properties, most notably the phenomenon known as the lanthanide contraction, which describes the steady decrease in the radii of the trivalent ions ($Ln^{3+}$) across the series. This trend in ionic size directly influences the nature of the chemical bonds these elements form and, consequently, the properties of their compounds.\n\nConsider the trivalent hydroxides of three lanthanide elements: Lanthanum hydroxide ($La(OH)_3$), Gadolinium hydroxide ($Gd(OH)_3$), and Lutetium hydroxide ($Lu(OH)_3$).

By Fajans’ rules, the covalent character of an $M$–$O$ bond increases as the cation’s polarizing power increases.\n\nAcross the lanthanide series from La to Lu, the lanthanide contraction leads to a steady decrease in the ionic radius $r$ of $Ln^{3+}$:\n$$r_{\\text{La}^{3+}} > r_{\\text{Gd}^{3+}} > r_{\\text{Lu}^{3+}}.$$\nDefine the ionic potential of the cation as\n$$I = \\frac{z}{r},$$\nwhere $z$ is the charge on the cation.
