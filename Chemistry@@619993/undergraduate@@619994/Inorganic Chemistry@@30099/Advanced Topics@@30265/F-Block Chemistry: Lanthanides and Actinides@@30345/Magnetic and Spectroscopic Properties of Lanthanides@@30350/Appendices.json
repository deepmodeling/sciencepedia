From rule 1, $S=3$ occurs for $k=6$ (since $S=\\frac{6}{2}=3$) and for $k=8$ (holes $h=6$ give $S=\\frac{6}{2}=3$). For these two:\n- For $k=6$ ($\\text{Eu}^{3+}$, less than half-filled): choose six $m_{l}$ values $3,2,1,0,-1,-2$ with parallel spins to maximize $L$. The sum is $3+2+1+0+(-1)+(-2)=3$, so $L=3$ ($F$). Hund’s third rule gives the ground $J$ as $J=|L-S|=|3-3|=0$. Thus the ground term is ${}^7F_0$, not ${}^7F_6$.\n- For $k=8$ ($\\text{Tb}^{3+}$, more than half-filled): use hole equivalence with $h=6$, which has the same $S=3$ and $L=3$ as $k=6$.
