{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the most fundamental ways to distinguish metals is through the acid-base properties of their oxides. This first practice invites you to compare the basicity of a d-block oxide, $Cr_2O_3$, with an f-block oxide, $La_2O_3$. By analyzing the factors that govern the ionic character of the metal-oxygen bond, such as electronegativity and ionic size, you will develop a foundational understanding of why f-block elements often exhibit more pronounced metallic and basic character than many of their d-block counterparts [@problem_id:2240102].", "problem": "An inorganic chemist is investigating the chemical properties of metal oxides, focusing on a comparison between a d-block element oxide, chromium(III) oxide ($Cr_2O_3$), and an f-block element oxide, lanthanum(III) oxide ($La_2O_3$). In both compounds, the metal cation is in the +3 oxidation state. Your task is to predict the relative basicity of these two oxides.\n\nBased on fundamental principles of chemical bonding and periodic trends, which of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison and reasoning?\n\nA. $Cr_2O_3$ is more basic than $La_2O_3$ because chromium is in the first row of the d-block, which typically form the most basic oxides among transition metals.\n\nB. $La_2O_3$ is more basic than $Cr_2O_3$ because lanthanum is significantly less electronegative than chromium, which imparts a greater ionic character to the La-O bond.\n\nC. Both oxides have comparable basicity because the metallic elements, chromium and lanthanum, are both in the +3 oxidation state.\n\nD. $Cr_2O_3$ is more basic than $La_2O_3$ because the smaller ionic radius of the $Cr^{3+}$ ion compared to the $La^{3+}$ ion leads to a higher charge density, which strengthens the basic character of the oxide.\n\nE. $La_2O_3$ is more basic than $Cr_2O_3$ because f-block elements are inherently more metallic and thus always form more basic oxides than d-block elements, regardless of other factors.", "solution": "We compare the basicity of $Cr_{2}O_{3}$ and $La_{2}O_{3}$ by applying fundamental bonding principles and periodic trends. The basicity of a metal oxide correlates with the ionic character of the metal–oxygen bond: more ionic oxides are more basic, while increased covalency reduces basicity and can lead to amphoterism or acidity. Two key factors control this: (i) the metal’s electronegativity (lower electronegativity promotes ionic bonding), and (ii) the cation’s charge density and polarizing power (higher charge density increases covalent character via polarization of the oxide anion, per Fajans’ rules). Additionally, metallic character tends to increase basicity of the oxide. Qualitatively, a basic oxide reacts with water to form hydroxide, e.g., $M_{2}O_{3}+3\\,H_{2}O \\rightarrow 2\\,M(OH)_{3}$; a more ionic, electropositive $M$ favors this basic behavior, whereas a small, highly polarizing $M^{3+}$ reduces the oxide’s basicity.\n\nLanthanum is a large, electropositive f-block metal with low electronegativity, so $La$–$O$ bonding in $La_{2}O_{3}$ is strongly ionic, yielding a strongly basic oxide. Chromium is a first-row transition metal; $Cr^{3+}$ is relatively small with high charge density, which according to Fajans’ rules increases polarization of $O^{2-}$ and introduces covalent character in $Cr$–$O$, decreasing basicity and producing amphoteric behavior in $Cr_{2}O_{3}$. Thus, $La_{2}O_{3}$ is more basic than $Cr_{2}O_{3}$ because $La$ is much less electronegative and forms a more ionic oxide than $Cr$.\n\nEvaluating the options: A is incorrect because first-row transition-metal oxides are often less basic and can be amphoteric; $Cr_{2}O_{3}$ is not more basic than $La_{2}O_{3}$. B is correct: lower electronegativity of $La$ leads to greater ionic character and higher basicity. C is incorrect because identical oxidation state does not equalize basicity; bonding character matters. D is incorrect because a smaller $Cr^{3+}$ with higher charge density increases polarization and covalency, which reduces, not strengthens, basic character. E is an overgeneralization; while lanthanide oxides are typically basic, the absolute statement “always … regardless of other factors” is not a sound justification; B provides the accurate, principle-based reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2240102"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the solid state to aqueous solutions, the behavior of hydrated metal ions offers deeper insights into metal-ligand interactions. This exercise focuses on the acidity of aqua ions, comparing the d-block $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$ with the f-block $[Gd(H_2O)_9]^{3+}$. You will explore how both charge density and the potential for covalent bonding—a key distinction arising from the differing nature of d- and f-orbitals—determine the ease with which a coordinated water molecule releases a proton [@problem_id:2240130].", "problem": "The acidity of hydrated metal ions is a key concept in coordination chemistry, describing the tendency of a coordinated water molecule to release a proton. Consider two specific aqua ions, that of iron(III), $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$, and that of gadolinium(III), $[Gd(H_2O)_9]^{3+}$. The acid dissociation for the first deprotonation step is quantified by the pKa value. For these two species, the experimentally determined pKa values are approximately 2.2 for $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$ and 8.0 for $[Gd(H_2O)_9]^{3+}$.

The $Fe^{3+}$ ion has a smaller ionic radius than the $Gd^{3+}$ ion, leading to a higher charge density. Additionally, the Fe-O bonds have greater covalent character due to the participation of d-orbitals in bonding.\n\nB. The $Gd^{3+}$ ion has a higher formal charge than the $Fe^{3+}$ ion, allowing it to better stabilize the negative charge of the resulting hydroxide ligand.\n\nC. The hydrated iron(III) complex has a lower coordination number, which makes the individual coordinated water molecules more acidic.\n\nD. The 4f orbitals of $Gd^{3+}$ are more effective at forming covalent bonds with water ligands than the 3d orbitals of $Fe^{3+}$, which stabilizes the aqua ion and reduces its acidity.\n\nE.

The markedly lower $pK_{a}$ of $[Fe(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{3+}$ relative to $[Gd(H_{2}O)_{9}]^{3+}$ implies stronger polarization of the coordinated O–H bond by $Fe^{3+}$.\n\nThe acidity of metal aqua ions correlates with the metal’s polarizing power on the coordinated water ligands, which depends primarily on charge density. For fixed charge $+3$, a smaller ionic radius $r$ gives a stronger electric field at the ligand and greater polarization of the O–H bond, stabilizing $[M(H_{2}O)_{n-1}(OH)]^{2+}$ relative to $[M(H_{2}O)_{n}]^{3+}$ and increasing $K_{a}$. The $Fe^{3+}$ ion is significantly smaller than $Gd^{3+}$, so its charge density is higher and its Lewis acidity stronger; this is a principal reason for the lower $pK_{a}$ of $[Fe(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{3+}$.\n\nIn addition, the nature of metal–ligand bonding differs: for $Fe^{3+}$, the 3d orbitals can overlap appreciably with O 2p orbitals, imparting greater covalent character to the Fe–O bond. This increased covalency enhances electron withdrawal from the coordinated water oxygen and further weakens the O–H bond, facilitating deprotonation. In contrast, for $Gd^{3+}$ the 4f orbitals are contracted and core-like, contributing little to bonding; lanthanide–oxygen bonds are largely ionic, leading to weaker polarization of the O–H bond and thus higher $pK_{a}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly identifies both the higher charge density of $Fe^{3+}$ due to its smaller radius and the greater covalent character arising from 3d participation, both of which increase acidity.\n- B is false because $Fe^{3+}$ and $Gd^{3+}$ have the same formal charge.\n- C is incomplete and misleading: coordination number differences do not dominate the strong acidity difference; size and bonding character are the primary factors.\n- D is incorrect: 4f orbitals are poor at covalent bonding compared to 3d, and the stated effect is opposite to established bonding trends.\n- E is an overgeneralization and does not provide the causal explanation.\n\nTherefore, the most complete and accurate explanation is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2240130"}, {"introduction": "The stability of half-filled electron subshells is a familiar concept, yet it can be misleading when comparing the redox chemistry of d- and f-block elements.
