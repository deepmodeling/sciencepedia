This filling has a significant consequence on the chemical and physical properties of these elements and their compounds.\n\nConsider two trivalent metal fluorides: Lanthanum(III) Fluoride ($LaF_3$) and Lutetium(III) Fluoride ($LuF_3$). For the purpose of this problem, assume that both compounds adopt the exact same crystal structure type.\n\nBased on fundamental principles of inorganic chemistry, which of these two compounds would you predict to have a lattice energy of greater magnitude? Select the option that contains both the correct prediction and the correct primary justification.\n\nA. LaF3, because the La³⁺ ion is larger than the Lu³⁺ ion, which minimizes Pauli repulsion between electron clouds in the crystal lattice.\n\nB. LuF3, because the Lu³⁺ ion is smaller than the La³⁺ ion due to the lanthanide contraction, resulting in a smaller interionic distance and thus a stronger electrostatic attraction.\n\nC. LuF3, because Lutetium is heavier than Lanthanum, and the greater mass leads to stronger London dispersion forces that contribute to the lattice energy.\n\nD. LaF3, because the 4f orbitals in Lu³⁺ are completely filled, leading to increased inter-electronic repulsion that weakens the ionic bond compared to LaF3 where the 4f orbitals are empty.\n\nE. The lattice energies are approximately equal, because both cations have a +3 charge and the anion is F⁻ in both cases, making the charge product the dominant and effectively equal factor.", "solution": "We compare the lattice energies using the Born–Landé expression for an ionic crystal:\n$$\nU=-\\frac{N_{A} M z_{+} z_{-} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} r_{0}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $N_{A}$ is Avogadro’s constant, $M$ is the Madelung constant determined by the crystal structure, $z_{+}$ and $z_{-}$ are the ionic charges, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity, $r_{0}$ is the nearest-neighbor cation–anion separation, and $n$ is the Born exponent describing short-range repulsion.\n\nGiven that $LaF_{3}$ and $LuF_{3}$ adopt the same crystal structure type, $M$ and $n$ are the same for both. Both salts contain $\\mathrm{M^{3+}}$ cations and $\\mathrm{F^{-}}$ anions, so $z_{+}=3$ and $z_{-}=1$ are also the same. The constants $N_{A}$, $e$, and $\\epsilon_{0}$ are universal. Therefore, the only variable that differs between the two is $r_{0}$:\n$$\n|U| \\propto \\frac{1}{r_{0}}.\n$$\n\nBy the lanthanide contraction, the ionic radius decreases across the series from $\\mathrm{La^{3+}}$ to $\\mathrm{Lu^{3+}}$, so $\\mathrm{Lu^{3+}}$ is smaller than $\\mathrm{La^{3+}}$.

This corresponds to option B. Alternative justifications are incorrect: Pauli repulsion minimization is not the dominant term for lattice energy magnitude here (A), atomic mass and London dispersion are not the primary contributors to ionic lattice energy (C), filled $4f$ shells do not increase interelectronic repulsion to weaken the ionic bond in a way that outweighs Coulombic attraction (D), and ignoring the effect of interionic distance while focusing only on charge products is incomplete (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294774"}, {"introduction": "Beyond influencing physical properties, the lanthanide contraction also systematically alters the chemical nature of bonding across the series. This practice delves into how the changing size of the $Ln^{3+}$ cation impacts the character of the metal-oxygen bond in their common oxides. By applying the principles of ionic polarization, you will analyze whether the bonding becomes more ionic or more covalent, providing insight into the reactivity and acid-base properties of these materials. [@problem_id:2294788]", "problem": "The lanthanide series of elements, from Lanthanum (La, Z=57) to Lutetium (Lu, Z=71), are characterized by the filling of the 4f electron subshell. A prominent chemical feature of these elements is their stable +3 oxidation state, leading to the formation of a series of sesquioxides with the general formula $M_2O_3$, where M is a lanthanide metal.\n\nConsider the trend in the chemical bonding properties of these oxides across the series. As one progresses from lanthanum(III) oxide ($La_2O_3$) to lutetium(III) oxide ($Lu_2O_3$), how does the nature of the metal-oxygen (M-O) bond change? Select the statement that correctly describes the trend and provides the most accurate underlying chemical principle.\n\nA. The M-O bond becomes progressively more ionic. This is because the decreasing size of the $M^{3+}$ cation leads to a lower polarizing power, thereby strengthening the purely electrostatic interaction with the oxide anion.\n\nB. The M-O bond becomes progressively more covalent. This is because the decreasing size of the $M^{3+}$ cation leads to a greater charge density and thus a greater polarizing power, increasing the sharing of electron density with the oxide anion.\n\nC. The M-O bond character remains essentially constant across the series. Since all the cations have the same $+3$ charge and belong to the same f-block series, their fundamental bonding characteristics with a given anion like $O^{2-}$ are nearly identical.\n\nD. The M-O bond becomes progressively more covalent. This is because the ionization energy of the lanthanide metal required to form the $M^{3+}$ cation increases significantly, which in turn causes the resulting oxide to favor electron sharing.\n\nE. The M-O bond becomes progressively more ionic. This is because the increasing nuclear charge of the lanthanide atom more effectively stabilizes a closed-shell ionic configuration, discouraging the formation of covalent character.", "solution": "We identify how M–O bond character varies across $M_{2}O_{3}$ for lanthanides $M^{3+}$ from La to Lu by applying the lanthanide contraction and Fajans' rules. \n\nFirst, across the lanthanide series from La to Lu, the effective nuclear charge on the valence shell increases while the $4f$ electrons shield poorly. This produces the lanthanide contraction, so the ionic radius decreases monotonically:\n$$\nr\\left(\\mathrm{La}^{3+}\\right) > r\\left(\\mathrm{Lu}^{3+}\\right).\n$$\nSecond, according to Fajans' rules, the extent of covalent character in an ionic bond increases with the polarizing power of the cation and the polarizability of the anion. For a given anion $O^{2-}$, the dominant variable across the series is the cation’s polarizing power. A standard measure of polarizing power $P$ is proportional to the cation charge $z$ divided by the square of its radius $r$:\n$$\nP \\propto \\frac{z}{r^{2}}.\n$$\nAcross the lanthanide series, $z=+3$ is constant while $r$ decreases due to the lanthanide contraction. Therefore,\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{La}^{3+}} < P_{\\mathrm{Lu}^{3+}},\n$$\nso the polarizing power increases from La to Lu. Increased polarizing power of the cation induces greater distortion of the electron cloud of $O^{2-}$, enhancing electron density sharing between M and O, i.e., increasing covalent character in the M–O bond.\n\nA closely related viewpoint is that the cationic charge density increases as $r$ decreases; equivalently, the electrostatic field strength near the cation increases, which enhances polarization of the anion and thus covalency. Additionally, the slight increase in electronegativity across the series is consistent with a small increase in covalent character. Empirically, this corresponds with decreasing basicity of the oxides from La to Lu, which is a hallmark of increasing M–O covalency.\n\nNow we evaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect: decreasing $r$ at constant $z$ increases, not decreases, polarizing power, which increases covalency rather than ionicity.\n- Option B is correct: the decreasing size increases charge density and polarizing power, so the M–O bond becomes progressively more covalent.\n- Option C is incorrect: the lanthanide contraction induces a continuous change in $r$ and thus in polarizing power and bonding character.\n- Option D is incorrect: while ionization energies to form $M^{3+}$ do change across the series, the covalency trend in the solid oxide is governed primarily by cation size and polarizing power with a given anion, not by the formation energetics of the gas-phase cation.\n- Option E is incorrect: increasing nuclear charge, with poor $4f$ shielding, makes the cation smaller and more polarizing, which increases covalency rather than ionicity.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the M–O bond becomes progressively more covalent across the series because the $M^{3+}$ cation becomes smaller, increasing its polarizing power and promoting electron density sharing with $O^{2-}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294788"}, {"introduction": "The impact of the lanthanide contraction reaches far beyond the f-block, profoundly influencing the properties of subsequent elements in the 6th period. This hands-on thought experiment quantifies the effect by asking you to calculate the hypothetical size of a gold atom without this contraction.
