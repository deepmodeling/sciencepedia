By using Bond Dissociation Enthalpies (BDEs), we can create a simple but powerful thermodynamic model to estimate the feasibility of breaking and forming chemical bonds.

The thermodynamics of this reaction, M + R-X → R-M-X, can be estimated by considering the bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of the bonds broken and formed.\n\nConsider a generic low-valent metal complex, M, which can undergo oxidative addition with either a fluorocarbon, R-F, or an iodocarbon, R-I. We are interested in quantifying the thermodynamic difference between these two activation processes.\n\nUse the following hypothetical, average BDE values for your calculations:\n- BDE for the C-F bond in R-F: 485 kJ/mol\n- BDE for the C-I bond in R-I: 240 kJ/mol\n- BDE for the M-C bond formed: 200 kJ/mol (assume this is independent of the halogen)\n- BDE for the M-F bond formed: 450 kJ/mol\n- BDE for the M-I bond formed: 280 kJ/mol\n\nLet $\\Delta H_{C-F}$ be the estimated reaction enthalpy for the oxidative addition of the C-F bond, and $\\Delta H_{C-I}$ be the estimated reaction enthalpy for the oxidative addition of the C-I bond.\n\nCalculate the difference, $\\Delta(\\Delta H) = \\Delta H_{C-F} - \\Delta H_{C-I}$.

Oxidative addition is a cornerstone elementary step where a metal center formally inserts into a chemical bond, and its stereospecificity is often key to controlling the structure of catalytic intermediates. This classic problem [@problem_id:2288165] involving a Vaska-type complex illustrates how the geometry of the starting metal complex can be predictably translated to the product, a vital concept for designing stereoselective catalysts.", "problem": "Consider the reaction of the square planar complex *trans*-$[\\text{Ir}(\\text{CO})\\text{Cl}(\\text{PPh}_3)_2]$, where $PPh_3$ represents the triphenylphosphine ligand, with an excess of methyl iodide ($CH_3I$). This reaction is known to proceed to completion, yielding a single major organometallic product. The geometry of the starting complex is square planar, with the two bulky $PPh_3$ ligands positioned *trans* to each other, and similarly, the carbonyl (CO) and chloro (Cl) ligands are *trans* to one another.\n\nAssuming the reaction results in a stable, six-coordinate octahedral iridium(III) complex, identify the correct structural description of this major product from the options provided below.\n\nA. An octahedral complex where the two $PPh_3$ ligands remain *trans* to each other, the CO and Cl ligands remain *trans* to each other, and the newly added methyl ($CH_3$) and iodo (I) groups are positioned *trans* to each other.\n\nB. An octahedral complex where the two $PPh_3$ ligands remain *trans* to each other, the CO and Cl ligands remain *trans* to each other, but the newly added methyl ($CH_3$) and iodo (I) groups are positioned *cis* (adjacent) to each other.\n\nC.

Using the neutral ligand method, CO and $PPh_3$ are neutral donors, while $Cl^-$ is an anionic ligand with charge $-1$. The overall complex is neutral, so the metal oxidation state satisfies\n$$\\text{ox. state of Ir} + (-1) = 0 \\implies \\text{Ir is } +1.$$\nIridium in the $+1$ oxidation state is $d^{8}$, and with four ligands it adopts a square planar geometry, consistent with the given structure.\n\nReaction with $CH_3I$ proceeds by oxidative addition of the C–I bond to the Ir center. The fundamental principle of oxidative addition is that both the metal oxidation state and coordination number increase by $2$. Thus, Ir goes from $+1$ to $+3$ and from $d^{8}$ to $d^{6}$, giving a six-coordinate octahedral Ir(III) product. Formally, $CH_3I$ adds as $CH_3^{-}$ and $I^{-}$, so in the product the anionic ligands are $Cl^{-}$, $I^{-}$, and $CH_3^{-}$, giving a neutral complex with Ir in the $+3$ oxidation state:\n$$\\text{Ir}^{+3} \\text{ with ligation: CO, Cl}^{-}, \\text{I}^{-}, \\text{CH}_{3}^{-}, \\text{PPh}_{3}, \\text{PPh}_{3}.$$\n\nThe stereochemical outcome follows the well-established behavior of oxidative addition to square planar $d^{8}$ complexes (Vaska-type). The four ligands present prior to oxidative addition define a square plane. In a stereospecific oxidative addition that retains the original arrangement, the two newly added ligands occupy the two positions perpendicular to that plane in the resulting octahedral complex. These two positions are trans to each other. Consequently:\n- The original trans relationships ($PPh_3$ trans to $PPh_3$, and CO trans to Cl) are retained in the equatorial plane.\n- The newly added $CH_3$ and I necessarily occupy the remaining pair of positions, which are trans to each other.\n\nThis geometric constraint can also be seen from the octahedral geometry: if two independent trans pairs ($PPh_3$–$PPh_3$ and CO–Cl) are fixed, the remaining two coordination sites must form the third trans pair. Therefore, with the original trans pairs preserved, $CH_3$ and I must be trans to each other.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- Option A matches exactly this outcome: $PPh_3$ ligands remain trans, CO and Cl remain trans, and $CH_3$ and I are trans. This is the expected stereospecific oxidative addition product and is also sterically favorable because the bulky $PPh_3$ ligands remain trans.\n- Option B proposes $CH_3$ and I cis while both $PPh_3$ and CO–Cl remain trans. This is geometrically impossible in an octahedron; fixing two independent trans pairs forces the last two positions to be trans, not cis.\n- Options C and D require rearrangement to make the two bulky $PPh_3$ ligands cis. This is strongly disfavored sterically and contradicts the usual stereoretentive outcome of oxidative addition to this Ir(I) square planar precursor.\n- Option E is false; oxidative addition of $CH_3I$ to $trans\\text{-}[\\text{Ir}(\\text{CO})\\text{Cl}(\\text{PPh}_3)_2]$ is a well-known, facile reaction that proceeds to completion under the stated conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct structural description is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2288165"}, {"introduction": "A productive catalyst must not only perform the desired transformation but also resist unwanted side reactions and decomposition.

For this reaction to occur directly, several conditions must typically be met, including the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon atom beta to the metal center and an available coordination site on the metal.\n\nConsider the organometallic complex ethylpentacarbonylmanganese(I), which has the chemical formula $[\\text{Mn}(\\text{CO})_5(\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3)]$.

The manganese center is rendered too electron-poor by the five strongly π-accepting carbonyl ligands, which destabilizes the transition state for C-H bond activation.\n\nD. The five carbonyl ligands create significant steric hindrance that prevents the M-C-C-H dihedral angle from achieving the syn-coplanar geometry required for the transition state.\n\nE. The overall reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable because the formation of a manganese-hydride bond and an ethene molecule is energetically uphill from the starting manganese-ethyl complex.", "solution": "Beta-hydride elimination from a metal-alkyl complex proceeds by a concerted pathway that requires: (i) at least one hydrogen on the carbon beta to the metal, (ii) a vacant coordination site on the metal to accept an agostic interaction from the C–H bond in a syn-coplanar M–C–C–H arrangement, and (iii) a suitable electron count and geometry to access the transition state. The most immediate kinetic gate is the need for a vacant site.\n\nFor the complex $[\\text{Mn}(\\text{CO})_5(\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3)]$, perform an electron count using the ionic method. The manganese oxidation state is $+1$ (neutral complex; five neutral CO ligands; one anionic ethyl). Thus the metal is $d^{6}$.

Direct beta-hydride elimination requires such a site to form the necessary agostic interaction and transition state; without prior ligand dissociation (for example, CO loss to generate a $16$-electron species), the direct pathway is kinetically inaccessible under standard conditions. This coordinative saturation is the primary reason for kinetic stability against direct beta-hydride elimination.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because an ethyl group possesses beta hydrogens on the terminal methyl carbon.\n- B is correct: the complex follows the $18$-electron rule and is coordinatively saturated, leaving no vacant site for beta-hydride elimination.\n- C may describe a secondary electronic effect, but it is not the primary kinetic reason; many electron-poor complexes still undergo beta-hydride elimination if a vacant site is available.\n- D is not compelling here; carbonyls are not so sterically demanding as to universally preclude the required geometry, and sterics are not the dominant factor in this canonical system.\n- E addresses thermodynamics, whereas the observed stability is dominantly kinetic; moreover, beta-hydride elimination in analogous systems is often reversible and not strongly uphill.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and primary reason is coordinative saturation and the absence of a vacant site, i.e., option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2300461"}]}
