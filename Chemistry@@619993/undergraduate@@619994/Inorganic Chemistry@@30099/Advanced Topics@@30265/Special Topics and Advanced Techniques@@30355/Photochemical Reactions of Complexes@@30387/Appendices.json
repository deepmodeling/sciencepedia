(i) Bromide ligand; (ii) Both the bromide ligand and the terminal amine group are substituted at equal rates.", "solution": "This problem requires us to apply two distinct sets of principles to predict the outcome of a substitution reaction on a square planar platinum(II) complex: one for a thermal (ground-state) reaction and one for a photochemical (excited-state) reaction. The complex is $\\text{[Pt(dien)Br]}^+$, where the tridentate dien ligand and a bromide ligand occupy the four coordination sites around the Pt(II) center. The solvent is water, which acts as the incoming nucleophile.\n\n**Part (i): Thermal Substitution Reaction**\n\nThermal substitution reactions of square planar $d^8$ complexes like Pt(II) are governed by ground-state properties. We need to determine which ligand, an amine donor from the dien ligand or the bromide ligand, is more likely to be replaced by a water molecule. Several factors influence this outcome.\n\n1.  **Bond Strength and Leaving Group Ability**: Platinum-nitrogen bonds are generally stronger and less labile than platinum-bromide bonds. Correspondingly, the bromide ion ($Br^-$) is a better leaving group than a neutral amine group would be.\n2.  **The Chelate Effect**: The dien ligand is a tridentate chelating agent. Dissociating one of the Pt-N bonds to break open the chelate ring is entropically unfavorable. The loss of a monodentate ligand like $Br^-$ does not incur this entropic penalty. The stability gained from the chelate effect strongly disfavors the partial dissociation of the dien ligand.\n\nWhile the trans effect also plays a role in the kinetics of square planar substitution (labilizing the ligand trans to a strong trans-director), the combination of leaving group ability and the powerful chelate effect makes the substitution of the monodentate $Br^-$ ligand the overwhelmingly favored thermal pathway.\n\nTherefore, upon heating, the bromide ligand is substituted by a water molecule:\n$$[Pt(dien)Br]^+ + H_2O \\xrightarrow{\\Delta} [Pt(dien)(H_2O)]^{2+} + Br^-$$\n\nThe ligand substituted in the thermal reaction is the **bromide ligand**.\n\n**Part (ii): Photochemical Substitution Reaction**\n\nPhotochemical reactions proceed through an electronically excited state, and their mechanisms can be very different from thermal reactions. For substitutions in $d^8$ square planar complexes, a set of general principles (often related to Adamson's rules) can be used to predict the product.\n\n1.  **Identify Ligand Field Strengths**: We first rank the ligands according to their ligand field strength using the spectrochemical series. For the ligands in $\\text{[Pt(dien)Br]}^+$, the order is: $Br^-$ (weak field) < amine N-donors (strong field).\n\n2.  **Identify the \"Weak Axis\"**: Photochemical labilization is predicted to occur along the axis of the complex containing the weakest-field ligand. The problem states that the complex has a terminal amine group trans to the bromide ligand. The two axes of the complex are therefore `(term-NH_2)-Pt-(sec-NH)` and `(term-NH_2)-Pt-Br`. Since $Br^-$ is the weakest field ligand in the entire complex, the `(term-NH_2)-Pt-Br` axis is the \"weak axis.\"\n\n3.  **Determine the Leaving Group**: The rule for photosubstitution states that on the labilized \"weak axis\", it is the ligand with the **stronger ligand field** that is preferentially substituted. On the `(term-NH_2)-Pt-Br` axis, the amine group ($-\\text{NH}_2$) is the stronger field ligand compared to the bromide ($Br^-$).\n\nTherefore, upon UV irradiation, the N-donor of the terminal amine group that is trans to the bromide ligand will be substituted by a water molecule. This involves the dissociation of one arm of the dien chelate.\n\nThe ligand substituted in the photochemical reaction is the **terminal amine group of the dien ligand that is trans to the bromide**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n-   In the thermal reaction (i), the **bromide ligand** is substituted.\n-   In the photochemical reaction (ii), the **terminal amine group of the dien ligand that is trans to the bromide** is substituted.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2281900"}, {"introduction": "Once a photochemical reaction pathway is established, the next crucial question is its efficiency. This exercise [@problem_id:2281896] introduces the concept of quantum yield ($\\Phi$) by asking you to compare two related metal carbonyl complexes.

It is defined as the number of reacting molecules per photon absorbed. Consider the photochemical substitution of a carbonyl (CO) ligand from two isostructural octahedral metal hexacarbonyl complexes, $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$ and $\\text{[W(CO)}_6\\text{]}$, in a non-coordinating solvent. Upon absorption of a photon of suitable energy, a M-C bond is cleaved, forming a short-lived square pyramidal intermediate, $\\text{[M(CO)}_5\\text{]}$, and a dissociated CO ligand within a \"solvent cage\". This intermediate can then either react with a new ligand to form a product or undergo geminate recombination, where it recombines with the original CO ligand to reform the starting complex.

Both complexes would have nearly identical quantum yields as the primary photochemical step is the electronic excitation, which is similar for isoelectronic species.", "solution": "Define the quantum yield $\\Phi$ for photosubstitution as the number of molecules that proceed to substitution per photon absorbed.

This final problem [@problem_id:2281870] explores how chemists can dramatically enhance the light-emitting properties of a copper(I) complex by altering its molecular structure. This practice will deepen your understanding of the competition between radiative and non-radiative decay, showing how suppressing unwanted structural changes in the excited state is a powerful strategy for creating efficient luminescent materials.", "problem": "Copper(I) complexes with diimine ligands are of great interest for applications in photocatalysis and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Consider two related copper(I) complexes, Complex A and Complex B, in a non-coordinating solvent.\n\nComplex A is bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)copper(I), denoted as $\\text{[Cu(dmp)}_2]^+$. In this complex, the two bulky `dmp` ligands enforce a pseudo-tetrahedral coordination geometry around the Cu(I) center.\n\nComplex B is a derivative where the two `dmp` ligands are covalently linked by a short, rigid hydrocarbon chain, effectively \"strapping\" them together. This creates a single, more rigid tetradentate ligand system around the copper center, but maintains the same donor atoms and a similar pseudo-tetrahedral ground-state geometry.\n\nUpon photoexcitation, both complexes exhibit luminescence originating from a Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) excited state. However, experimental measurements show that the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), which is the ratio of photons emitted to photons absorbed, is dramatically higher for the strapped Complex B ($\\Phi_B \\approx 0.25$) compared to the unstrapped Complex A ($\\Phi_A < 10^{-4}$).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the significantly higher PLQY of the strapped Complex B compared to its unstrapped analogue, Complex A?\n\nA. The hydrocarbon strap is electron-donating, which lowers the energy of the LUMO on the phenanthroline ligands, making the radiative transition more energetically favorable.\n\nB. The strap increases the steric bulk around the metal center, preventing solvent molecules from approaching and quenching the excited state via collisional deactivation.\n\nC. The strap creates a rigid coordination sphere that sterically disfavors the large structural reorganization (flattening) that the complex would otherwise undergo in the excited state, thereby suppressing a major non-radiative decay pathway.\n\nD. The strap enhances spin-orbit coupling at the copper center, which accelerates intersystem crossing to the emissive triplet state and thus increases the efficiency of phosphorescence.\n\nE. The covalent strap prevents photo-induced dissociation of one of the phenanthroline ligands, which is the primary deactivation pathway for the unstrapped Complex A.", "solution": "Define the photoluminescence quantum yield as the ratio of the radiative decay rate to the total decay rate from the emissive excited state:\n$$\n\\Phi=\\frac{k_{r}}{k_{r}+k_{nr}},\n$$\nwhere $k_{r}$ is the radiative rate constant and $k_{nr}$ is the sum of all nonradiative rate constants.\n\nFrom the observation that $\\Phi_{A}\\ll 1$ for Complex A and $\\Phi_{B}$ is substantially larger for Complex B, it follows that $k_{nr,A}\\gg k_{r,A}$, while for Complex B the ratio $k_{nr,B}/k_{r,B}$ is much smaller. If $k_{r}$ is similar for the two complexes, then the difference in $\\Phi$ must be dominated by a reduction in $k_{nr}$ upon strapping.\n\nFor copper(I) diimine complexes, the lowest excited state is typically MLCT in character. Promotion to an MLCT state formally increases Cu oxidation state character toward Cu(II) and places electron density on the diimine acceptor. The Cu(II)-like character strongly favors a more square-planar geometry, whereas the Cu(I) ground state prefers pseudo-tetrahedral geometry. Therefore, along the excited-state relaxation coordinate there exists a large-amplitude flattening motion that lowers the MLCT state energy and provides an efficient pathway to nonradiative decay through internal conversion and population of nonemissive metal-centered states. This behavior is commonly rationalized by pseudo–Jahn-Teller vibronic coupling between the tetrahedral-like MLCT surface and lower-lying distorted surfaces that prefer flattened coordination.\n\nModel the structural distortion along a generalized flattening coordinate $Q$ with a harmonic restoring force in the ground-state framework, $V_{g}(Q)=\\frac{1}{2}kQ^{2}$, and an excited-state stabilization by vibronic coupling $FQ$ to a lower-symmetry configuration. The pseudo–Jahn-Teller stabilization energy scales as\n$$\nE_{s}\\propto \\frac{F^{2}}{k\\Delta},\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the vibronic coupling constant along $Q$, $k$ is the effective force constant (rigidity) opposing distortion, and $\\Delta$ is the energy gap between the interacting electronic states. The equilibrium distortion amplitude on the excited surface scales as\n$$\nQ^{*}\\propto \\frac{F}{k}.\n$$\nA larger $Q^{*}$ facilitates access to crossings or avoided crossings with dark states and increases Franck–Condon overlap with high-density vibrational manifolds, enhancing nonradiative decay. In nonadiabatic theories of internal conversion, a dominant contribution to $k_{nr}$ can be written as\n$$\nk_{nr}\\propto |H_{c}|^{2}\\,\\rho(\\Delta E,\\lambda),\n$$\nwhere $|H_{c}|$ is the electronic coupling between the MLCT and accepting states (often maximized at flattened geometries), and $\\rho$ is the Franck–Condon weighted density of states that grows rapidly with large structural reorganization energy $\\lambda$ associated with $Q^{*}$. Because $\\lambda$ increases with the distortion amplitude, reducing $Q^{*}$ and suppressing access to flattened geometries decreases $\\rho$ and $|H_{c}|$ at the relevant geometries, thereby lowering $k_{nr}$.\n\nIntroducing a short, rigid covalent strap between the two diimine ligands increases the effective stiffness $k$ of the coordination sphere and sterically blocks the flattening coordinate. Symbolically, $k\\to k_{\\text{strap}}>k_{\\text{unstrap}}$ implies $Q^{*}\\to Q^{*}_{\\text{strap}}<Q^{*}_{\\text{unstrap}}$, which in turn reduces both the reorganization that promotes nonradiative decay and the probability of reaching geometries where nonradiative crossings are efficient. Thus,\n$$\nk_{nr,B}\\ll k_{nr,A},\n$$\nwhile $k_{r,B}\\approx k_{r,A}$ because the donor atoms, overall electronic structure, and absence of additional heavy atoms are unchanged to first order.
