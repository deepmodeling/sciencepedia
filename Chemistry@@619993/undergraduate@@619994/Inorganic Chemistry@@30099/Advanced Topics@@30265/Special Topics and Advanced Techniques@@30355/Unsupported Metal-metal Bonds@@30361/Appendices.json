Principles used:\n- A group 7 metal center contributes $7$ valence electrons.\n- Each terminal carbonyl ligand, CO, donates $2$ electrons.\n- A metal–metal single bond is a $2$-electron bond shared between two metals; when counting per metal center, it contributes $1$ electron to each metal.\n\nFor $Mn_2(CO)_{10}$:\n- Each $Mn$ is group $7$, so contributes $7$ electrons.\n- Each $Mn$ is bound to $5$ CO ligands, contributing $5 \\times 2 = 10$ electrons.\n- The $Mn\\text{--}Mn$ bond contributes $1$ electron per $Mn$ center.\nTherefore, the valence electron count per $Mn$ center is\n$$\n7 + 10 + 1 = 18.\n$$\nAn $18$-electron configuration is a closed shell; thus each $Mn$ center is diamagnetic, and the whole molecule is diamagnetic.\n\nEquivalently, the total electron count for the dimer is\n$$\n2 \\times 7 + 10 \\times 2 + 2 = 36,\n$$\nwhich is consistent with two $18$-electron centers and a closed-shell, diamagnetic species.\n\nFor the monomeric radical fragment $Mn(CO)_5$:\n- The $Mn$ center contributes $7$ electrons.\n- The $5$ CO ligands contribute $5 \\times 2 = 10$ electrons.\n- There is no metal–metal bond.\nThus, the valence electron count is\n$$\n7 + 10 = 17,\n$$\nwhich is an odd-electron configuration, implying one unpaired electron and hence a paramagnetic radical.\n\nTherefore, $Mn_2(CO)_{10}$ is diamagnetic and $Mn(CO)_5$ is paramagnetic, matching option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2297285"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting the existence of a bond, we can also quantify its strength.
