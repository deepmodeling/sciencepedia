A key step in the proposed catalytic cycle involves an interaction between the metal center (M) and a C-H bond of an attached ethyl group. To characterize the structure of this crucial intermediate, a neutron diffraction experiment is performed, which is highly sensitive to the positions of hydrogen atoms. The experiment yields the following key geometric parameters for the suspected interaction:\n\n*   Metal-Hydrogen distance (M-H): 1.85 Å\n*   Carbon-Hydrogen distance (C-H): 1.16 Å\n*   Metal-Hydrogen-Carbon angle (M-H-C): 105°\n\nIn the context of organometallic chemistry, an \"agostic interaction\" describes a three-center, two-electron bond where a metal atom interacts with a C-H bond. The structural criteria for identifying a distinct, or \"strong,\" agostic interaction are generally accepted as follows:\n1.  The M-H distance is typically 10-20% longer than a corresponding terminal M-H bond (a standard two-center, two-electron M-H bond, which is usually around 1.60 Å), but significantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii.\n2.  The M-H-C angle is distinctly acute, generally falling in the range of 90° to 120°.\n3.  The C-H bond involved in the interaction is elongated compared to a typical, non-interacting C-H bond in a similar chemical environment (which is approximately 1.09 Å).\n\nBased on the experimental data and the provided criteria, which of the following statements is the most accurate assessment of the M-H-C unit in the complex?\n\nA. The M-H-C unit represents a classical dative bond from the C-H sigma-bond to the metal, but the parameters do not fit the criteria for a strong agostic interaction.\n\nB. The parameters are highly consistent with the presence of a strong agostic interaction, as all three geometric criteria are satisfied.\n\nC. The parameters suggest only a very weak agostic interaction, primarily because the M-H distance is too long to be considered a significant bonding interaction.\n\nD. The system is best described as a fully formed alkyl hydride, where the C-H bond has been completely broken to form a terminal M-H bond and a metal-carbon bond.\n\nE. No definitive conclusion can be drawn from the geometric data alone; spectroscopic data, such as the C-H stretching frequency from Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, would be required.", "solution": "We are asked to assess whether the measured M-H-C geometry is consistent with a strong agostic interaction by checking it against the three geometric criteria stated.\n\nFirst criterion (M-H distance relative to a terminal M-H bond): A typical terminal M-H bond is about $1.60\\,\\text{\\AA}$. The measured value is $d_{\\mathrm{M-H}}=1.85\\,\\text{\\AA}$. The fractional elongation relative to a terminal M-H bond is\n$$\n\\frac{d_{\\mathrm{M-H}}-1.60}{1.60}=\\frac{1.85-1.60}{1.60}=0.15625,\n$$\nwhich lies within the stated window $0.10$ to $0.20$. Moreover, $1.85\\,\\text{\\AA}$ is significantly shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii for a metal and hydrogen, satisfying the requirement that the contact is well within bonding distance rather than a mere van der Waals contact. Thus, criterion 1 is satisfied.\n\nSecond criterion (acute M-H-C angle): The measured angle is $\\angle(\\mathrm{M-H-C})=105^{\\circ}$, which lies within the $90^{\\circ}$ to $120^{\\circ}$ range specified for agostic interactions. Thus, criterion 2 is satisfied.\n\nThird criterion (C-H bond elongation): A typical non-interacting C-H bond in a similar environment is about $1.09\\,\\text{\\AA}$. The measured value is $d_{\\mathrm{C-H}}=1.16\\,\\text{\\AA}$. The elongation is\n$$\n\\Delta d_{\\mathrm{C-H}}=1.16-1.09=0.07\\,\\text{\\AA}>0,\n$$\nshowing the C-H bond is measurably longer than typical, as expected for an agostic interaction. Thus, criterion 3 is satisfied.\n\nBecause all three independent geometric diagnostics are met, the parameters are highly consistent with a strong agostic interaction. This supports option B. For completeness, we note why the other options are less accurate: A is inconsistent because the parameters do fit strong agostic criteria; C is inconsistent because $1.85\\,\\text{\\AA}$ is not too long in this context and matches the expected 10 to 20 percent elongation; D is inconsistent because a fully formed terminal M-H bond would be near $1.60\\,\\text{\\AA}$ and the C-H bond would not persist at $1.16\\,\\text{\\AA}$; E is overly cautious in light of the stated criteria, because the geometric data provided are sufficient to make the assignment here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2233285"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying agostic bonds, it is essential to understand the electronic factors that govern their formation. This problem explores how the ancillary ligands attached to a metal center can tune its electronic properties, thereby influencing its tendency to form an agostic interaction.

The tendency for an agostic interaction will increase because CO is a strong pi-acceptor, which makes the metal center more electron-deficient.\n\nB. The tendency for an agostic interaction will decrease because CO is a less sterically bulky ligand than trimethylphosphine, which removes the crowding that forces the C-H bond toward the metal.\n\nC. The tendency for an agostic interaction will decrease because trimethylphosphine is a strong sigma-donor, and a more electron-rich metal center is required for an agostic interaction.\n\nD. The tendency for an agostic interaction will increase because CO is a stronger sigma-donor than trimethylphosphine, which strengthens the overall metal-ligand framework.\n\nE.

The key electronic requirement is that the metal center be sufficiently electron-deficient and possess a low-lying acceptor orbital; the stabilization arises from $\\sigma_{\\text{C-H}} \\rightarrow M$ donation. Therefore, the tendency for agostic bonding increases as the metal becomes more electron-poor and decreases as the metal becomes more electron-rich.\n\nCompare the ligands by their electronic effects on the metal:\n- Trimethylphosphine, $\\text{P}(\\text{CH}_3)_3$, is a strong $\\sigma$-donor and a weak $\\pi$-acceptor. Its net effect is to increase electron density at $M$ by strong $\\sigma$ donation and minimal $\\pi$ backbonding withdrawal. Relative to CO, it renders $M$ more electron-rich, which disfavors agostic donation because the acceptor character of the metal is reduced.\n- Carbon monoxide, CO, is a strong $\\pi$-acceptor and a competent $\\sigma$-donor. The dominant effect compared to $\\text{P}(\\text{CH}_3)_3$ is strong $\\pi$-acceptance that promotes $M \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}_{\\text{CO}}$ backbonding, which withdraws electron density from the metal and makes $M$ more electron-deficient.

CO’s strong $\\pi$-acceptor character makes $M$ more electron-deficient, increasing agostic propensity.\n- B: Incorrect emphasis. Although CO is less bulky than $\\text{P}(\\text{CH}_3)_3$, steric relief alone does not override the dominant electronic effect; furthermore, the prompt requests a prediction based on fundamental electronic properties.\n- C: Incorrect. Agostic interactions are favored by an electron-deficient (not electron-rich) metal; strong $\\sigma$ donation from $\\text{P}(\\text{CH}_3)_3$ makes the metal more electron-rich and therefore generally reduces agostic tendency.\n- D: Incorrect. CO is not a stronger $\\sigma$-donor than $\\text{P}(\\text{CH}_3)_3$; its key distinguishing feature is strong $\\pi$-acceptance.\n- E: Incorrect. Although both ligands are neutral and do not change formal oxidation state, they strongly affect the electron density at the metal through $\\sigma$ donation and $\\pi$ backbonding, which in turn alters agostic propensity.\n\nThus, the best prediction is that the agostic tendency increases when replacing $\\text{P}(\\text{CH}_3)_3$ with CO.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2233271"}, {"introduction": "Once an agostic interaction is identified, it must be correctly incorporated into the electronic models used to predict the stability and reactivity of organometallic complexes.
