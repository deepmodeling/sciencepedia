This initial interaction is not always the same; it can range from a weak, temporary physical attraction to the formation of a strong chemical bond. This exercise [@problem_id:2257163] will guide you in exploring the fundamental energetic differences between these two modes of adsorption—physisorption and chemisorption—a distinction that is foundational to understanding catalyst activity and selectivity.", "problem": "A materials scientist is studying the interaction of gases with a newly developed metallic catalyst surface maintained at a low temperature. Two separate experiments are conducted in an ultra-high vacuum chamber to ensure surface purity. In the first experiment, the pristine surface is exposed to a controlled dose of Argon (Ar) gas. In the second experiment, a fresh, identical pristine surface is exposed to a controlled dose of Carbon Monoxide (CO) gas. In both cases, the exothermic process of adsorption occurs, where gas molecules bind to the surface and release heat.\n\nThe interaction of Argon, a noble gas, with the surface is known to be governed by weak, non-specific van der Waals forces. In contrast, Carbon Monoxide can form a strong, directional chemical bond with the metal atoms on the surface through the lone pair of electrons on its carbon atom.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of surface chemistry, which of the following statements correctly predicts the relative magnitude of the heat released during these two processes and provides the correct underlying reasoning?\n\nA. Argon adsorption will release significantly more heat because Ar is a noble gas, and its complete electron shell leads to a very stable, low-energy bound state on the surface.\n\nB. Carbon Monoxide adsorption will release significantly more heat because it undergoes chemisorption, a process involving chemical bond formation, which is inherently much more energetic than the physisorption process that Argon undergoes.\n\nC. Argon adsorption will release significantly more heat because its atomic radius is larger than the covalent radius of Carbon, allowing for a greater surface area of interaction and thus stronger overall van der Waals forces.\n\nD. Carbon Monoxide adsorption will release significantly more heat because the very strong triple bond within the CO molecule is broken upon adsorption, releasing its bond energy as heat.\n\nE. Both processes will release a comparable amount of heat because the heat of adsorption is primarily determined by the kinetic energy of the incoming gas molecules, which is the same for both gases if they are at the same temperature.", "solution": "The problem asks us to compare the heat released when Argon (Ar) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) adsorb onto a metal surface. The heat released during adsorption corresponds to the negative of the enthalpy of adsorption, $-\\Delta H_{ads}$. Adsorption processes are categorized into two main types based on the nature of the interaction forces: physisorption and chemisorption.\n\nFirst, let's define these two types of adsorption.\n1.  **Physisorption (Physical Adsorption):** This process is driven by weak, non-specific intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces (including London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and induced-dipole interactions). In physisorption, no chemical bonds are formed or broken, and the electronic structure of the adsorbate molecule remains largely unperturbed. This interaction is analogous to the condensation of a gas into a liquid. The enthalpy of physisorption is typically low, with magnitudes in the range of 20 to 40 kJ/mol.\n2.  **Chemisorption (Chemical Adsorption):** This process involves the formation of a true chemical bond (e.g., covalent or ionic) between the adsorbate molecule and the atoms of the surface. This requires a significant overlap of electron orbitals and creates a new chemical species at the surface. The process is highly specific to the nature of the adsorbate and the surface. The enthalpy of chemisorption is comparable to that of chemical reactions, with typical magnitudes in the range of 80 to 400 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, let's apply these definitions to the specific case described in the problem.\n-   **Argon (Ar):** The problem states that Ar interacts with the surface via weak van der Waals forces. Argon is a noble gas with a closed-shell electronic configuration, making it chemically inert. It cannot form chemical bonds under these conditions. Therefore, the adsorption of Ar on the metal surface is a classic example of physisorption. We expect the heat released to be small.\n-   **Carbon Monoxide (CO):** The problem states that CO forms a strong, directional chemical bond with the metal surface. On many transition metal surfaces, CO acts as a Lewis base, donating electron density from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) on the carbon atom into an empty d-orbital of the metal. Simultaneously, the metal can back-donate electron density from a filled d-orbital into an empty antibonding orbital (the $\\pi^*$) of the CO molecule. This synergistic bonding mechanism results in the formation of a strong coordinate covalent bond. This process is, by definition, chemisorption. We expect the heat released to be large.\n\nComparing the two, the heat released from chemisorption (CO) will be significantly greater than the heat released from physisorption (Ar) because the formation of a chemical bond releases much more energy than the weak attraction due to van der Waals forces. The energy difference is typically an order of magnitude.\n\nFinally, let's evaluate the given options:\n-   **A:** This is incorrect. The stable, closed electron shell of Ar is precisely why it only interacts weakly via van der Waals forces, leading to *low* heat of adsorption.\n-   **B:** This is correct. It precisely identifies the types of adsorption for each molecule (chemisorption for CO, physisorption for Ar) and correctly states that chemical bond formation in chemisorption is a much more energetic (exothermic) process.\n-   **C:** This is incorrect. While the magnitude of van der Waals forces does scale with size/polarizability, this effect is minor and cannot overcome the fundamental difference in the nature and strength of the interaction between physisorption and chemisorption.\n-   **D:** This is incorrect. This describes a common misconception. The process of chemisorption involves the *formation* of a new bond between the adsorbate and the surface. The strong C-O triple bond is typically weakened slightly upon adsorption, but it is not broken. The energy is released from the formation of the new metal-carbon bond, not the destruction of the internal C-O bond.\n-   **E:** This is incorrect. The heat of adsorption is an intrinsic thermodynamic property of the adsorbate-adsorbent system. While the kinetics of adsorption can depend on the incoming kinetic energy of the molecules, the total heat released upon reaching the bound state is determined by the potential energy difference between the free gas molecule and the adsorbed state, not the initial kinetic energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2257163"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand that reactants must adsorb onto a surface, the next logical question is: how does the number of available surface sites affect the overall reaction rate? The Langmuir model provides a powerful framework for thinking about this relationship. This exercise [@problem_id:2257142] challenges you to apply the core assumptions of this model to explain a classic kinetic phenomenon—why a reaction rate, initially dependent on reactant pressure, becomes constant at high pressures.

The reaction mechanism is well-described by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, where the rate-determining step is the surface reaction of an adsorbed molecule of A. Experimental observations show that at low partial pressures of reactant A, the reaction rate is directly proportional to its pressure. However, as the partial pressure of A becomes very high, the reaction rate approaches a constant, maximum value and becomes independent of the pressure of A.\n\nWhich of the following statements, based on the core assumptions of the Langmuir model, correctly explains why the reaction rate becomes constant at very high reactant pressures?\n\nA. At high pressures, the fraction of occupied active sites on the catalyst surface approaches one, meaning the surface is saturated. The rate is then limited by the intrinsic speed of the surface reaction itself, not by the rate of reactant adsorption.\n\nB. At high pressures, the ideal gas assumption for reactant A breaks down, and intermolecular forces in the gas phase reduce the effective rate at which molecules strike the surface, causing the reaction rate to plateau.\n\nC. At high pressures, the reaction equilibrium $A(\\text{g}) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Products}$ shifts strongly to the left, and the net forward reaction rate is suppressed, leading to a constant observed rate.\n\nD. At high pressures, multilayer adsorption of reactant A begins to occur. Since only the first layer is catalytically active, the addition of further layers does not increase the reaction rate.\n\nE. At high pressures, the rate of desorption of reactant A becomes significantly faster than its rate of adsorption, preventing the surface concentration from increasing further and thus holding the reaction rate constant.", "solution": "Let $A(\\mathrm{g})$ adsorb on a uniform set of catalytic sites $*$ to form $A*$, with monolayer coverage and no lateral interactions (Langmuir assumptions).
