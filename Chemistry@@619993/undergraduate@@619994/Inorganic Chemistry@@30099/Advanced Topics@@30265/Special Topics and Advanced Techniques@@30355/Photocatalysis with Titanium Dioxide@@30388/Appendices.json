The process relies on a semiconductor, such as titanium dioxide ($\\text{TiO}_2$), which can absorb a photon of light to create an electron-hole pair. This is achieved when the photon's energy is sufficient to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band of the semiconductor. The minimum energy required for this electronic transition is equal to the semiconductor's band gap energy, $E_g$.\n\nA chemist is investigating the degradation of a pollutant using the anatase crystalline form of $\\text{TiO}_2$, which has a band gap energy of $E_g = 3.20$ eV.

Yes, the process will be initiated because the high intensity of the laser beam can compensate for the low energy of individual photons through a multi-photon absorption process.\n\nB.

No, the process will not be initiated because the energy of a photon from the red laser is less than the band gap energy of anatase $\\text{TiO}_2$.\n\nD.

The experiment involves the degradation of an organic pollutant, modeled by a solution of Methylene Blue (MB) dye. The student prepares a suspension of $\\text{TiO}_2$ nanoparticles in an aqueous solution of MB and exposes it to a Ultraviolet (UV) light source. Over the course of the experiment, the student observes a significant decrease in the intensity of the blue color of the solution, suggesting the MB has been removed.\n\nHowever, the student recognizes that the removal of the dye from the solution could be due to two possible processes:\n1.  **Photocatalytic degradation**: The UV light excites the $\\text{TiO}_2$, creating electron-hole pairs that generate highly reactive radicals, which then chemically break down the MB molecules into colorless products.\n2.  **Physical adsorption**: The MB molecules simply stick to the large surface area of the $\\text{TiO}_2$ nanoparticles without being chemically changed.\n\nTo definitively prove that the observed dye removal is primarily due to photocatalysis and not just physical adsorption, the student must design a proper control experiment. Which of the following experimental procedures represents the most direct and crucial control for isolating the effect of physical adsorption?\n\nA. Run a parallel experiment containing the same concentrations of MB and $\\text{TiO}_2$, but keep the suspension in complete darkness for the same duration.\n\nB.

Photocatalysis mechanism: Under UV irradiation, $\\text{TiO}_2$ absorbs photons with energy greater than or equal to its band gap, generating electron-hole pairs. These charge carriers form reactive oxygen species that chemically degrade MB into colorless products. This pathway requires both $\\text{TiO}_2$ and UV light.\n2. Adsorption mechanism: MB can physically adsorb onto the surface of $\\text{TiO}_2$ nanoparticles due to electrostatic and surface interactions. This process does not require light and can occur in the dark.\n3. Control requirement: To isolate the effect of physical adsorption, the experiment must keep all variables the same (MB concentration, $\\text{TiO}_2$ loading, time, mixing, temperature, pH, ionic strength) while eliminating the possibility of photocatalysis. The necessary and sufficient condition to eliminate photocatalysis is to remove the light input while keeping $\\text{TiO}_2$ present with MB for the same duration.\n4. Interpretation strategy: Measure the MB concentration (e.g., via absorbance using the Beer–Lambert law) after the dark control. Any decrease relative to the initial value is attributable to adsorption. The difference between the UV-irradiated experiment and the dark control quantifies the net photocatalytic degradation.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A keeps MB and $\\text{TiO}_2$ identical but eliminates UV light, thereby suppressing photocatalysis and isolating adsorption. This is the direct and crucial control.\n- B removes $\\text{TiO}_2$ but keeps UV light; it tests direct photolysis of MB, which is a different control (useful but not isolating adsorption).\n- C omits MB entirely; it cannot measure adsorption of MB and thus does not serve the purpose.\n- D irradiates filtrate after removing $\\text{TiO}_2$; it does not isolate adsorption and confounds post-reaction effects.\n- E changes the catalyst; it introduces a new variable and is not a control for adsorption.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and crucial control to isolate physical adsorption is to perform the experiment in the dark with MB and $\\text{TiO}_2$ present for the same duration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2281569"}, {"introduction": "Once confirmed that photocatalysis is occurring, the next step is to probe the reaction mechanism.
