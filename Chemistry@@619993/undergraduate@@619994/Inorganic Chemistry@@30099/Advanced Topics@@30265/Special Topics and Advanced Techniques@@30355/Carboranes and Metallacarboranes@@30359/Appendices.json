For a cluster with $n$ skeletal vertices, the required number of skeletal electron pairs (SEP) is $n+1$ for closo, $n+2$ for nido, $n+3$ for arachno, and $n+4$ for hypho. For neutral carboranes with two carbon atoms, there is a convenient diagnostic by hydrogen count relative to $n$: the characteristic formulas are closo $C_{2}B_{n-2}H_{n}$, nido $C_{2}B_{n-2}H_{n+2}$, arachno $C_{2}B_{n-2}H_{n+4}$, and hypho $C_{2}B_{n-2}H_{n+6}$. Equivalently, for $n$ total vertices, the hydrogen count $H$ equals $n$, $n+2$, $n+4$, or $n+6$ for closo, nido, arachno, or hypho, respectively.\n\nFor $B_{4}C_{2}H_{8}$, the total number of skeletal vertices is $n=4+2=6$, and the hydrogen count is $H=8$. The difference is $H-n=2$, which matches the nido family ($H=n+2$). Therefore, $B_{4}C_{2}H_{8}$ is classified as nido.\n\nHence, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2237436"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static classification, the true power of electron-counting rules lies in predicting how a cluster's structure will change in response to a chemical reaction.

Structurally, it consists of a closed cage (a *closo*-cluster) in the shape of an icosahedron, with ten vertices occupied by boron atoms and two adjacent vertices occupied by carbon atoms. Each boron and carbon atom is also bonded to one external hydrogen atom. The room temperature, proton-decoupled $^{11}$B Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum of $1,2-C_2B_{10}H_{12}$ in solution exhibits four distinct resonance signals with a relative intensity ratio of 2:2:4:2.\n\nThis neutral carborane can be chemically reduced by reacting it with two equivalents of a strong reducing agent, such as sodium naphthalenide, to form the dianion, $[1,2-C_2B_{10}H_{12}]^{2-}$. This reduction process induces a significant change in the geometry of the molecular cage.\n\nBased on the principles of cluster electron counting and the fundamentals of NMR spectroscopy, predict the most likely qualitative changes that would be observed in the proton-decoupled $^{11}$B NMR spectrum when comparing the neutral starting material, $1,2-C_2B_{10}H_{12}$, to its dianionic product, $[1,2-C_2B_{10}H_{12}]^{2-}$.\n\nA.

Consistently, the observed proton-decoupled $^{11}$B NMR shows four signals in a $2:2:4:2$ ratio, reflecting the symmetry-inequivalent boron sites in the $n=12$ closo cage containing two adjacent carbon atoms.\n\nUpon two-electron reduction to the dianion $[1,2$-$\\mathrm{C_{2}B_{10}H_{12}}]^{2-}$, the skeletal electron count increases by $2$ electrons:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{skeletal}}^{2-} = 26 + 2 = 28 = 2n + 4 \\quad (n=12).\n$$\nBy Wade–Mingos rules, $2n+4$ corresponds to a nido cluster for the same number of vertices, i.e., an open-cage structure. This transformation from closo to nido lowers the molecular symmetry and increases the number of symmetry-inequivalent boron environments. Therefore, the number of distinct $^{11}$B resonances is expected to increase relative to the four observed for the neutral closo species.\n\nNext, consider the qualitative direction of $^{11}$B chemical shift changes. In NMR, the local field at the nucleus is\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{loc}} = B_{0}(1 - \\sigma),\n$$\nwhere $B_{0}$ is the applied magnetic field and $\\sigma$ is the shielding constant. The resonance frequency is proportional to $B_{\\mathrm{loc}}$, and the chemical shift $\\delta$ decreases (moves upfield to lower ppm) as $\\sigma$ increases. Addition of electrons into skeletal bonding orbitals of the cluster increases electron density at boron and generally increases $\\sigma$ for $^{11}$B, producing upfield shifts. The conversion from neutral closo to electron-richer nido dianion thus leads to significantly more shielded $^{11}$B nuclei, hence appreciable upfield movement of their resonances.\n\nCombining these two effects:\n- Structural change closo $\\rightarrow$ nido lowers symmetry and increases the number of distinct boron sites, so the number of $^{11}$B signals increases.\n- Increased electron density upon reduction increases shielding, so $^{11}$B resonances shift significantly upfield (to lower ppm).\n\nTherefore, the correct qualitative prediction is that the number of signals increases and they shift upfield.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2237460"}, {"introduction": "Delving deeper into the electronic structure of metallacarboranes often raises nuanced questions that go beyond simple geometric prediction. When a complex undergoes reduction, where does the added electron reside—on the metal or on the ligand cage? This advanced problem [@problem_id:2237483] presents a thought experiment designed to sharpen your understanding of molecular orbitals and spectroscopy, exploring how Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) can provide definitive evidence to distinguish between different possible electronic ground states.", "problem": "The diamagnetic metallacarborane anion, $[Co(C_2B_9H_{11})_2]^-$, commonly known as cobalt bis(dicarbollide), is a highly stable sandwich complex. In this species, a formal cobalt(III) ion ($d^6$) is coordinated by two *nido*-carborane ligands, $[C_2B_9H_{11}]^{2-}$, which act as 6-electron donors analogous to the cyclopentadienyl anion.\n\nA chemist performs a one-electron electrochemical reduction of this complex, generating the paramagnetic 19-electron species $[Co(C_2B_9H_{11})_2]^{2-}$. There are two plausible hypotheses for the electronic structure of this reduced product:\n\n*   **Hypothesis A:** The added electron is localized predominantly on the metal center, reducing it from Co(III) to Co(II). The product is best described as a high-spin or low-spin Co(II) ($d^7$) species.\n*   **Hypothesis B:** The added electron occupies a molecular orbital that is primarily ligand-based, delocalized over the two carborane cages. The metal center formally remains Co(III) ($d^6$).\n\nTo distinguish between these possibilities, an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrum of the reduced species is recorded. Based on your understanding of molecular orbital theory for organometallic complexes and the principles of EPR spectroscopy, predict which hypothesis is more likely and what characteristic features would appear in the EPR spectrum.\n\nThe relevant nuclear spin data are:\n*   $^{59}Co$: 100% abundance, $I = 7/2$\n*   $^{11}B$: 80.1% abundance, $I = 3/2$\n*   $^{10}B$: 19.9% abundance, $I = 3$\n*   $^{1}H$: 99.98% abundance, $I = 1/2$\n*   $^{12}C$: 98.9% abundance, $I = 0$\n\nSelect the option that presents the most plausible theoretical prediction and the corresponding definitive experimental signature.\n\nA. Hypothesis A is more likely. The EPR spectrum would be dominated by a large hyperfine coupling to a single $^{59}Co$ nucleus, resulting in an octet (8-line) pattern.\n\nB. Hypothesis B is more likely.

Hypothesis A is more likely. The EPR spectrum would be dominated by hyperfine coupling to the four $^{1}H$ nuclei attached to the carbon atoms, resulting in a quintet (5-line) pattern.\n\nF. Hypothesis B is more likely. The EPR spectrum would be dominated by coupling to the four framework carbon atoms, but since $^{12}C$ has $I=0$, it would simply show a single, sharp line with no hyperfine structure.", "solution": "We first establish the electron count and likely frontier orbitals. The diamagnetic parent anion $[Co(C_{2}B_{9}H_{11})_{2}]^{-}$ is an $18$-electron complex with a formal $d^{6}$ Co(III) center. Each $[C_{2}B_{9}H_{11}]^{2-}$ ligand donates $6$ electrons in analogy to $\\eta^{5}$-cyclopentadienyl, giving $12$ electrons from ligands and $6$ from the metal. Electrochemical one-electron reduction gives $[Co(C_{2}B_{9}H_{11})_{2}]^{2-}$, a $19$-electron species. The key question is whether the added electron occupies a predominantly metal-centered or ligand-centered molecular orbital.\n\nBy molecular orbital considerations for sandwich complexes with strongly delocalized carborane ligands, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the $18$-electron precursor is often ligand-based (having dominant carborane cage character with limited metal $d$ contribution). Thus, a one-electron reduction commonly populates a ligand-centered orbital, resulting in spin density delocalized over many boron atoms and only a small fraction on cobalt. This favors Hypothesis B over Hypothesis A.\n\nTo connect to EPR, we write the spin Hamiltonian for an $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ system:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\beta_{e}\\,\\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\mathbf{g}\\cdot \\mathbf{S} + \\sum_{k} \\mathbf{S}\\cdot \\mathbf{A}_{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{I}_{k},\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_{e}$ is the Bohr magneton, $\\mathbf{g}$ is the $g$-tensor, and $\\mathbf{A}_{k}$ are hyperfine tensors to nuclei with spin $\\mathbf{I}_{k}$. The EPR resonance condition in the simplest case is\n$$\nh\\nu = g \\mu_{B} B,\n$$\nand the selection rules are $\\Delta m_{S}=\\pm 1$, $\\Delta m_{I}=0$. Hyperfine structure for one coupled nucleus of spin $I$ produces $2I+1$ lines. For $n$ equivalent nuclei of spin $I$, the total number of lines is $2nI+1$, with intensities determined by multinomial coefficients for $I=\\frac{1}{2}$ and more complex patterns for $I>\\frac{1}{2}$. For multiple non-equivalent nuclei, the pattern is the convolution of individual splittings and often becomes broadened and unresolved if many couplings are present.\n\nIf the unpaired electron is metal-centered (Hypothesis A), the spin density at $^{59}$Co would be large, and the Fermi contact interaction would yield a dominant cobalt hyperfine coupling. Since $^{59}$Co has $I=\\frac{7}{2}$ and $100$ percent natural abundance, one expects an octet with $2I+1=8$ lines, typically with a large hyperfine constant and often significant $g$ anisotropy due to spin-orbit coupling characteristic of Co(II).\n\nIf the unpaired electron is ligand-centered (Hypothesis B), the spin density is spread over many boron atoms across both carborane cages, with only a small fraction on cobalt. The hyperfine pattern is then controlled by numerous $^{11}$B nuclei with $I=\\frac{3}{2}$ and natural abundance 0.801, interspersed with $^{10}$B nuclei with $I=3$ and natural abundance 0.199, plus many $^{1}$H nuclei with $I=\\frac{1}{2}$. Because there are many boron sites that are not equivalent, the resulting hyperfine structure is a superposition of many small couplings, leading to a complex and frequently unresolved multiplet, often observed as a broadened line or a poorly resolved envelope. In this scenario, the $^{59}$Co hyperfine coupling is small or negligible because the metal spin density is low, so no dominant $8$-line cobalt pattern is expected. Additionally, the $g$-value would be close to the free-electron value and relatively isotropic, characteristic of ligand-centered organic-like radicals, in contrast to the more anisotropic and shifted $g$ typical for Co(II) centers.\n\nWe can now evaluate the options against these principles:\n- A predicts Hypothesis A with an $8$-line $^{59}$Co pattern; this matches a metal-centered radical, not expected here.\n- B predicts Hypothesis B with complex, likely unresolved boron hyperfine and small/negligible $^{59}$Co coupling; this matches the ligand-centered radical picture and expected EPR signature.\n- C pairs Hypothesis A with boron-dominated hyperfine and small cobalt coupling, which contradicts a metal-centered radical.\n- D pairs Hypothesis B with a dominant cobalt octet, which contradicts a ligand-centered radical.\n- E predicts a dominant quintet from four equivalent $^{1}$H nuclei. In this framework, there are many $^{1}$H and numerous boron nuclei; even if there are four C–H protons, they are not equivalent and would not dominate over boron hyperfine in a ligand-centered radical.\n- F predicts a single sharp line due to coupling only to $^{12}$C ($I=0$). This ignores the numerous boron nuclei, which would produce complex hyperfine; thus it is inconsistent with a ligand-centered radical on carboranes.\n\nTherefore, Hypothesis B is more likely, and the definitive EPR signature is complex, largely boron-driven hyperfine with small or negligible cobalt hyperfine, rather than a dominant cobalt octet.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2237483"}]}
