Consider a molecule with a singlet ground electronic state ($S_0$), a first excited singlet state ($S_1$), a second excited singlet state ($S_2$), and a first excited triplet state ($T_1$). Each of these electronic states possesses a manifold of vibrational energy levels. After photoexcitation, the molecule can return to the ground state via several distinct pathways.\n\nFive de-excitation processes are described below:\n\nA. A transition occurs from the lowest vibrational level of the $S_2$ state to a high vibrational level of the $S_1$ state, with no photon being emitted.\nB. A transition occurs from the lowest vibrational level of the $S_1$ state to a vibrational level of the $S_0$ state, accompanied by the emission of a photon.\nC. A transition occurs from the lowest vibrational level of the $T_1$ state to a vibrational level of the $S_0$ state, accompanied by the emission of a photon. This process is typically much slower than process B.\nD. A transition occurs from the lowest vibrational level of the $S_1$ state to a high vibrational level of the $T_1$ state, with no photon being emitted.\nE. Following the transition described in process A, the molecule, now in a high vibrational level of the $S_1$ state, transitions to the lowest vibrational level of the same $S_1$ state.

Radiative processes involve photon emission; non-radiative processes proceed via internal conversion, intersystem crossing, or vibrational relaxation, transferring energy to other degrees of freedom (e.g., heat) without photon emission.\n\nClassify each process:\n\nProcess A: Transition from the lowest vibrational level of $S_{2}$ to a high vibrational level of $S_{1}$ with no photon emitted. This is an internal conversion between states of the same multiplicity (singlet to singlet) and is non-radiative.\n\nProcess B: Transition from the lowest vibrational level of $S_{1}$ to a vibrational level of $S_{0}$ with emission of a photon. This is fluorescence (radiative), hence radiative, not non-radiative.\n\nProcess C: Transition from the lowest vibrational level of $T_{1}$ to a vibrational level of $S_{0}$ with emission of a photon, typically slower than process B. This is phosphorescence (radiative), hence radiative, not non-radiative.\n\nProcess D: Transition from the lowest vibrational level of $S_{1}$ to a high vibrational level of $T_{1}$ with no photon emitted. This is intersystem crossing (singlet to triplet), which is non-radiative.\n\nProcess E: Transition within $S_{1}$ from a high vibrational level to the lowest vibrational level of the same electronic state, releasing energy as heat and not changing electronic state.
