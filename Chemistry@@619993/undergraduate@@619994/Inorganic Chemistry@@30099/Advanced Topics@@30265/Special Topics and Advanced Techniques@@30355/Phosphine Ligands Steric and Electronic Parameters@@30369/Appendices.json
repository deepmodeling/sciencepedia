The methyl group is the smallest typical alkyl substituent; the phenyl group is larger due to its six-membered ring and extended footprint; and the cyclohexyl group is a bulky saturated ring with a large three-dimensional envelope. Therefore, the steric order is\n$$\\theta(A) < \\theta(B) < \\theta(C).$$\n\nFor electronics, the $\\sigma$-donor strength correlates with the basicity of the phosphorus lone pair and the inductive/hyperconjugative effects of substituents. Alkyl groups are electron-releasing (positive inductive effect), increasing electron density at phosphorus, whereas aryl groups are less electron-donating and can reduce basicity relative to alkyls. Among the alkyl-substituted phosphines considered, tricyclohexylphosphine is known to be an especially strong $\\sigma$ donor (very strong +I effect with bulky saturated rings), stronger than trimethylphosphine, while triphenylphosphine is the weakest donor of the three.

This practice explores how you can systematically modify the electronic character of a ligand by introducing substituents on its aryl rings [@problem_id:2280757].

One common experimental method to quantify these properties is to measure the carbonyl stretching frequency ($\\nu(\\text{CO})$) of a related metal carbonyl complex using Infrared (IR) spectroscopy.\n\nConsider three arylphosphine ligands, designated X, Y, and Z:\n- Ligand X: Tris(4-methoxyphenyl)phosphine, $P(p\\text{-}C_6H_4OMe)_3$\n- Ligand Y: Triphenylphosphine, $P(C_6H_5)_3$\n- Ligand Z: Tris(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)phosphine, $P(p\\text{-}C_6H_4CF_3)_3$\n\nThese ligands are used to form a series of complexes with the general formula $L\\text{Ni(CO)}_3$, where $L$ is one of the phosphines X, Y, or Z. It is known that the magnitude of the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ frequency is inversely related to the electron-donating ability of the phosphine ligand L; a more strongly electron-donating ligand results in a lower $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ value for the complex.\n\nBased on the electronic effects of the substituents on the phenyl rings, predict the correct order of the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ stretching frequencies for the complexes formed with ligands X, Y, and Z.\n\nA. $\\nu(\\text{CO})(X) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(Y) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(Z)$\n\nB. $\\nu(\\text{CO})(Z) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(Y) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(X)$\n\nC. $\\nu(\\text{CO})(Y) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(X) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(Z)$\n\nD. $\\nu(\\text{CO})(Z) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(X) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(Y)$\n\nE. $\\nu(\\text{CO})(X) = \\nu(\\text{CO})(Y) = \\nu(\\text{CO})(Z)$", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the relative order of the carbonyl stretching frequencies, $\\nu(\\text{CO})$, for three complexes of the type $L\\text{Ni(CO)}_3$, where L is one of three different arylphosphine ligands (X, Y, or Z). The problem states that $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ is inversely related to the electron-donating ability of the ligand L. Therefore, to solve the problem, we must first rank the ligands according to their electron-donating strength ($\\sigma$-donor ability) and then use this ranking to determine the order of the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ frequencies.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the electronic nature of the substituents on each phosphine ligand.\nThe three ligands are based on the triphenylphosphine, $P(C_6H_5)_3$, framework. The electronic character of the phosphorus lone pair, which is responsible for $\\sigma$-donation to the metal, is modulated by the substituents on the para-position of the phenyl rings.\n\n- Ligand Y, triphenylphosphine ($P(C_6H_5)_3$), has no substituents on its phenyl rings. It serves as our reference point.\n\n- Ligand X, tris(4-methoxyphenyl)phosphine ($P(p\\text{-}C_6H_4OMe)_3$), has a methoxy group (-OMe) at the para position. The oxygen atom in the methoxy group has lone pairs that can be donated into the aromatic ring's $\\pi$-system through resonance (a +R effect). This resonance donation increases the electron density of the ring. While oxygen is electronegative and exerts an electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), the resonance effect from the para position is dominant. Therefore, the -OMe group is an overall electron-donating group (EDG). This increased electron density is partially relayed to the phosphorus atom, making its lone pair more available for donation. Thus, Ligand X is a stronger electron donor than Ligand Y.\n\n- Ligand Z, tris(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)phosphine ($P(p\\text{-}C_6H_4CF_3)_3$), has a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) at the para position. The three highly electronegative fluorine atoms strongly pull electron density away from the carbon atom. This creates a powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) that propagates through the sigma bonds of the phenyl ring. The -CF3 group is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG). This withdrawal of electron density from the ring reduces the electron density at the phosphorus atom, making its lone pair less available for donation. Thus, Ligand Z is a weaker electron donor than Ligand Y.\n\nStep 2: Rank the ligands by their $\\sigma$-donating strength.\nBased on the analysis in Step 1, the methoxy group enhances the electron-donating ability of the phosphine, while the trifluoromethyl group diminishes it. Therefore, the order of $\\sigma$-donating strength is:\nLigand X > Ligand Y > Ligand Z\n\nStep 3: Relate ligand donor strength to the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ frequency.\nThe interaction between the ligand, metal, and CO groups is described by the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model. The phosphine ligand (L) donates its lone pair electrons into an empty d-orbital on the nickel atom (the $\\sigma$-donation). In turn, the electron-rich nickel atom donates electron density from its filled d-orbitals into the empty antibonding $\\pi^*$ orbitals of the CO ligands. This process is called $\\pi$-backbonding.\n\n- A stronger $\\sigma$-donating ligand (like Ligand X) increases the electron density on the nickel center.\n- This increased electron density on the metal leads to greater $\\pi$-backbonding to the CO ligands.\n- Populating the antibonding $\\pi^*$ orbitals of CO weakens the C–O bond.\n- A weaker chemical bond vibrates at a lower frequency.\n\nTherefore, a stronger electron-donating ligand leads to a lower $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ stretching frequency.\n\nStep 4: Determine the order of the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ frequencies.\nUsing the inverse relationship established in Step 3 and the ligand donor strength order from Step 2 (X > Y > Z):\n\n- Ligand X is the strongest donor, so its complex, $X\\text{Ni(CO)}_3$, will have the most $\\pi$-backbonding and thus the lowest $\\nu(\\text{CO})$.\n- Ligand Z is the weakest donor, so its complex, $Z\\text{Ni(CO)}_3$, will have the least $\\pi$-backbonding and thus the highest $\\nu(\\text{CO})$.\n- Ligand Y is intermediate.\n\nThe resulting order of the carbonyl stretching frequencies is:\n$\\nu(\\text{CO})(Z) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(Y) > \\nu(\\text{CO})(X)$\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2280757"}, {"introduction": "The electronic character of a phosphine ligand is a two-way street, involving both $\\sigma$-donation to the metal and potential $\\pi$-acceptance from it. This problem focuses on $\\pi$-acidity, the ligand’s ability to accept electron density via backbonding, a property strongly influenced by substituent electronegativity [@problem_id:2280734]. By comparing phosphines with hydrogen, methyl, and highly electronegative fluorine substituents, you will develop a complete picture of the metal-phosphine bond and understand how to rank ligands as $\\pi$-acceptors.", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, the electronic properties of a ligand are crucial in determining the stability and reactivity of the resulting metal complex. Phosphine ligands ($PR_3$) are particularly versatile because their electronic character can be tuned by changing the R group. A key electronic property is π-acidity, which refers to the ligand's ability to accept electron density from a metal's filled d-orbitals into its own empty orbitals, a process known as π-backbonding.\n\nConsider the three phosphine ligands: phosphine ($PH_3$), trimethylphosphine ($PMe_3$), and phosphorus trifluoride ($PF_3$). Which of the following options correctly arranges these ligands in order of increasing π-acidity (from weakest to strongest π-acceptor) and provides the correct underlying electronic justification?\n\nA. $PMe_3 < PH_3 < PF_3$. The order is determined by the electronegativity of the groups attached to the phosphorus atom. More electronegative groups withdraw electron density from the phosphorus, lowering the energy of the ligand's acceptor orbitals and making them more accessible for backbonding.\n\nB. $PF_3 < PH_3 < PMe_3$. The order is determined by the steric bulk of the substituents. Less bulky groups like fluorine allow for a closer approach to the metal center, which paradoxically weakens the π-interaction by increasing lone-pair repulsion.\n\nC. $PMe_3 < PH_3 < PF_3$. The order is determined by the σ-donating ability of the ligand. Stronger σ-donors have more electron density on the phosphorus, which makes the ligand's empty orbitals lower in energy and thus better π-acceptors.\n\nD. $PF_3 < PH_3 < PMe_3$. The order is determined by the electronegativity of the groups attached to the phosphorus atom. Less electronegative groups, such as methyl, are better at stabilizing the empty orbitals on phosphorus, thus enhancing π-acidity.\n\nE. $PH_3 < PMe_3 < PF_3$. The order is determined by the unique p-orbitals of hydrogen. Hydrogen's lack of p-orbitals for bonding makes the P-H bond's antibonding orbital exceptionally low in energy, but this effect is outweighed by the electron-donating nature of the methyl groups in $PMe_3$.", "solution": "1) Define the property to be ordered. A ligand’s $\\pi$-acidity is its ability to accept electron density from a metal’s filled $d$ orbitals into ligand-based low-lying acceptor orbitals of appropriate symmetry (commonly denoted as $\\pi$ backbonding). The strength of $\\pi$ backbonding increases as the energy of the ligand’s acceptor orbital decreases and as overlap is favorable. Symbolically, if $E_{\\text{LUMO}}$ is the acceptor-orbital energy, then $\\pi$-acidity increases as $E_{\\text{LUMO}}$ decreases.\n\n2) Establish the substituent electronic effect on acceptor-orbital energy. Electron-withdrawing substituents on phosphorus stabilize (lower) the energies of acceptor orbitals on the ligand (including $\\sigma^{*}$ orbitals with $\\pi$ symmetry relative to the M–P axis), thereby increasing $\\pi$-acidity. Electron-donating substituents destabilize (raise) these acceptor-orbital energies, thereby decreasing $\\pi$-acidity.\n\n3) Apply to the specific ligands:\n- In $PF_{3}$, the highly electronegative $F$ substituents strongly withdraw electron density inductively, lowering the energy of acceptor orbitals, notably $\\sigma^*(\\text{P–F})$ orbitals that can accept backdonation with $\\pi$ symmetry. Thus $PF_{3}$ is a strong $\\pi$-acceptor and a weak $\\sigma$-donor.\n- In $PH_{3}$, $H$ is only weakly electron-withdrawing/donating; the acceptor orbitals are higher in energy than in $PF_{3}$, so $\\pi$-acidity is weaker than $PF_{3}$.\n- In $PMe_{3}$, the methyl groups donate electron density (via inductive effects and hyperconjugation), raising the energy of the ligand’s acceptor orbitals and thereby decreasing $\\pi$-acidity relative to $PH_{3}$.\n\n4) Order by increasing $\\pi$-acidity according to the above trends: $PMe_{3} < PH_{3} < PF_{3}$, because $E_{\\text{LUMO}}(PMe_{3}) > E_{\\text{LUMO}}(PH_{3}) > E_{\\text{LUMO}}(PF_{3})$.\n\n5) Match to the options and assess justifications. Option A gives $PMe_{3} < PH_{3} < PF_{3}$ and correctly attributes the trend to the electronegativity of the substituents: more electronegative groups withdraw electron density, lowering acceptor-orbital energies and enhancing $\\pi$-acidity. Options B, C, D, and E either give the wrong order or incorrect mechanistic rationale (e.g., steric control of $\\pi$-backbonding in this series, or claiming that stronger $\\sigma$ donation lowers acceptor-orbital energy, which it does not).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2280734"}]}
