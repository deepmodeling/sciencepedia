Mastering this relationship is the first step toward interpreting the spectra of complex organometallic molecules [@problem_id:2274091].", "problem": "In the study of organometallic chemistry, metal carbonyl clusters feature carbon monoxide (CO) ligands that can bond to one or more metal atoms. The specific bonding mode of a CO ligand significantly influences its physical properties, which can be probed using Infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Consider three distinct bonding modes for CO ligands in a hypothetical neutral metal carbonyl cluster:\n\n1.  **Terminal (T):** A CO ligand is bonded to a single metal atom (M-CO).\n2.  **$\\mu_2$-bridging (B2):** A CO ligand is bonded symmetrically to two metal atoms (M-CO-M).\n3.  **$\\mu_3$-bridging (B3):** A CO ligand is bonded symmetrically to three metal atoms, capping a triangular face of the metal cluster.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly arranges these three types of carbonyl ligands in order of increasing C-O bond stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$)?\n\nA.

T < B3 < B2", "solution": "The problem asks to rank the Carbon-Oxygen stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$) for terminal (T), $\\mu_2$-bridging (B2), and $\\mu_3$-bridging (B3) carbonyl ligands. The value of $\\nu_{CO}$ is a direct measure of the C-O bond strength; a stronger bond vibrates at a higher frequency.\n\nThe key to understanding the trend in $\\nu_{CO}$ for metal carbonyls is the concept of metal-to-ligand $\\pi$-back-donation. The bonding between a metal (M) and a carbon monoxide (CO) ligand consists of two primary interactions:\n1.  **$\\sigma$-donation:** The lone pair of electrons on the carbon atom of CO is donated into an empty d-orbital on the metal. This forms a M-C $\\sigma$-bond.\n2.  **$\\pi$-back-donation:** Electron density from filled metal d-orbitals is donated back into the empty $\\pi^*$ antibonding orbitals of the CO ligand.\n\nThe crucial interaction that affects the C-O bond strength is the $\\pi$-back-donation. When electron density is added to the $\\pi^*$ *antibonding* orbitals of the CO molecule, the bond order of the C-O bond is reduced, thereby weakening it. A weaker C-O bond results in a lower stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$) observed in the IR spectrum.\n\nNow, let's analyze the extent of $\\pi$-back-donation for each of the three bonding modes:\n\n-   **Terminal (T):** A single metal atom back-donates electron density into the CO $\\pi^*$ orbitals. This weakens the C-O bond relative to free CO (which has $\\nu_{CO} \\approx 2143 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$).\n\n-   **$\\mu_2$-bridging (B2):** The CO ligand is positioned between two metal atoms. Both metal atoms can simultaneously back-donate electron density into the same set of CO $\\pi^*$ orbitals. This results in a greater total amount of electron density being transferred into the antibonding orbitals compared to the terminal case. Consequently, the C-O bond in a $\\mu_2$-bridging ligand is weaker than that in a terminal ligand.\n\n-   **$\\mu_3$-bridging (B3):** The CO ligand interacts with three metal atoms. All three metals can contribute electron density to the CO $\\pi^*$ orbitals. This leads to the most extensive back-donation among the three modes. The C-O bond is therefore the most significantly weakened in the $\\mu_3$-bridging mode.\n\nTo summarize the effect on C-O bond strength:\nBond Strength (T) > Bond Strength (B2) > Bond Strength (B3)\n\nSince the stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$) is directly proportional to the bond strength, the frequencies must follow the same order:\n$\\nu_{CO}$ (T) > $\\nu_{CO}$ (B2) > $\\nu_{CO}$ (B3)\n\nThe question asks for the arrangement in order of *increasing* C-O bond stretching frequency. Therefore, we must reverse the order:\n$\\nu_{CO}$ (B3) < $\\nu_{CO}$ (B2) < $\\nu_{CO}$ (T)\n\nThis corresponds to the ordering B3 < B2 < T. Comparing this with the given options, we find that option C matches our derived order.\n\nAs a reference, typical IR stretching frequency ranges for these modes in neutral metal carbonyls are:\n-   Terminal (T): 1850 – 2120 $\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n-   $\\mu_2$-bridging (B2): 1750 – 1850 $\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n-   $\\mu_3$-bridging (B3): 1600 – 1750 $\\text{cm}^{-1}$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2274091"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational principles of carbonyl IR spectroscopy, this practice presents a common challenge faced by synthetic chemists: elucidating a molecule's structure from its spectroscopic data.

Terminal CO stretches are typically at higher wavenumber, while bridging and especially capping COs appear at lower wavenumber.\n\nThe spectrum shows exactly two bands in the CO stretching region: a relatively sharp band at $1995 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and a broader band centered at $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. The higher-frequency sharp band at $1995 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ is characteristic of terminal CO stretches, while the lower and broader band near $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ is characteristic of $\\mu_2$-bridging CO stretches (with breadth often arising from multiple coupled bridging modes that are close in energy). A $\\mu_3$-capped CO typically appears at even lower wavenumber than $\\mu_2$-bridging, so a band centered at $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ is more consistent with $\\mu_2$-bridging than with $\\mu_3$-capping.\n\nTherefore, the structure must contain both terminal and bridging CO ligands and produce only two distinct sets of IR-active CO stretches.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n\n- Option B (all terminal in $D_{3h}$, $M_3(CO)_{12}$) and Option E (linear, all terminal) both lack bridging CO. These would not plausibly give a strong band as low as $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$, and with multiple inequivalent terminal sites and vibrational couplings they would be expected to show more than a single terminal band. Thus both are inconsistent with the observed two-band pattern including a low-frequency band.\n\n- Option D ($C_{3v}$ with one $\\mu_3$-CO and nine terminal COs) contains a $\\mu_3$-CO, which should give a band typically lower than $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$, and the many terminal COs are unlikely to be all symmetry-equivalent in a way that yields only one terminal band; at minimum, one expects at least one $\\mu_3$ band and one or more terminal bands, i.e., more than two features or a $\\mu_3$ band at lower frequency than observed. This is not consistent with a single broad band centered at $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ plus one sharp terminal band.\n\n- Option C ($C_{2v}$ with two $\\mu_2$-bridges and remaining terminal) has low symmetry. Even if the two bridges are symmetry-equivalent, the terminal CO ligands in $C_{2v}$ will fall into multiple inequivalent sets, making it likely to produce more than two distinct CO stretching bands. This conflicts with the observation of exactly two bands.\n\n- Option A ($D_{3h}$ planar triangle with three $\\mu_2$-bridging CO and three terminal CO, all coplanar) provides exactly two symmetry-equivalent sets of CO ligands: three equivalent terminal CO and three equivalent $\\mu_2$-bridging CO. A group-theoretical count in $D_{3h}$ for three equivalent oscillators gives\n$$\\Gamma_{\\text{CO}} = A_{1}^{\\prime} + E^{\\prime}.$$\nFor in-plane CO stretches, $E^{\\prime}$ is IR-active, while $A_{1}^{\\prime}$ is Raman-active. Thus, each set (terminal and bridging) contributes one IR-active $E^{\\prime}$ band, giving exactly two IR bands total. The higher-frequency sharp band at $1995 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ corresponds to the set of terminal CO stretches, and the lower-frequency broader band centered at $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ corresponds to the set of $\\mu_2$-bridging CO stretches.

This final practice moves beyond static pictures to explore the concept of fluxionality, using the classic example of dicobalt octacarbonyl, $Co_2(CO)_8$.

The first isomer, dominant in the solid state, possesses $C_{2v}$ symmetry and features two bridging carbonyl (CO) ligands and six terminal CO ligands spanning a cobalt-cobalt single bond. The second isomer, which coexists in solution, has $D_{3d}$ symmetry and consists of two $Co(CO)_4$ units joined only by a cobalt-cobalt bond, with all eight carbonyl ligands being terminal.\n\nSpectroscopic studies indicate that these two isomers interconvert rapidly on the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) timescale. The most widely accepted low-energy pathway for this isomerization proceeds via a transition state that involves a *semi-bridging carbonyl* ligand. A semi-bridging carbonyl is one that is fully bonded to one metal center but also has a significant, albeit weaker, electronic interaction with the second metal center, representing an intermediate geometry between a symmetric bridge and a terminal position.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following sequences describes the most plausible mechanism for the intramolecular conversion of the doubly-bridged ($C_{2v}$) isomer to the non-bridged ($D_{3d}$) isomer?\n\nA. The bridged isomer first dissociates one terminal CO ligand to form a coordinatively unsaturated $Co_2(CO)_7$ intermediate. This intermediate then rearranges its geometry, followed by the re-association of a CO molecule from the solution to form the non-bridged isomer.\n\nB. The bridged isomer undergoes homolytic cleavage of the cobalt-cobalt bond, generating two seventeen-electron $Co(CO)_4$ radical fragments. These fragments subsequently recombine to form the non-bridged isomer.\n\nC. One of the two bridging carbonyls distorts into a semi-bridging position, leaning toward one of the cobalt atoms. This motion continues as the ligand becomes fully terminal on that cobalt atom. A similar and concerted or rapid subsequent motion of the second bridging carbonyl opens it to a terminal position on the other cobalt atom, completing the conversion.\n\nD. A terminal carbonyl ligand on one cobalt atom moves into a semi-bridging position. This ligand then becomes a fully symmetric bridging ligand, forming a transient triply-bridged intermediate, which subsequently rearranges to the non-bridged product.\n\nE. The two $Co(CO)_3$ units of the bridged isomer undergo a simple rotation about the cobalt-cobalt bond axis. This torsional motion forces the two bridging carbonyls to swing outward into terminal positions without passing through a distinct semi-bridging state.", "solution": "The $C_{2v}$ isomer of $Co_2(CO)_8$ has two bridging CO ligands and six terminal CO ligands across a Co-Co single bond; the $D_{3d}$ isomer has all eight CO ligands terminal across a Co-Co bond. Both isomers satisfy the 18-electron rule at each cobalt center. For the $C_{2v}$ isomer, per cobalt: 9 (Co valence) + 1 (from the Co-Co bond) + 6 (three terminal CO ligands at 2 electrons each) + 2 (two bridging CO ligands at 1 electron each) = 18. For the $D_{3d}$ isomer, per cobalt: 9 (Co valence) + 1 (Co-Co bond) + 8 (four terminal CO ligands at 2 electrons each) = 18. Thus, a low-energy intramolecular pathway should preserve near-18-electron counts throughout, avoid high-energy bond homolysis, and is consistent with spectroscopic identification of a semi-bridging CO in the transition state.\n\nOption A posits dissociation of a terminal CO to form $Co_2(CO)_7$, which would generate a 16-electron cobalt center upon CO loss, requiring external CO re-association. This is inconsistent with rapid intramolecular fluxionality on the NMR timescale and with the observed semi-bridging transition state; it also implies intermolecular CO exchange.\n\nOption B requires homolytic Co-Co bond cleavage to two $Co(CO)_4$ radicals, each 17 electrons, a high-energy and paramagnetic pathway not supported under conditions where rapid, reversible, diamagnetic fluxionality is observed; it does not rationalize a semi-bridging CO transition state.\n\nOption C describes distortion of one bridging CO into a semi-bridging geometry, followed by opening to a terminal position, with the second bridging CO undergoing an analogous motion, either concertedly or in rapid succession. This pathway preserves the Co-Co bond, maintains near-18-electron counts via continuous modulation of CO donation, and explicitly features the semi-bridging CO that spectroscopic studies identify as the low-energy transition-state motif. This matches the widely accepted mechanism for interconversion between the $C_{2v}$ and $D_{3d}$ isomers.\n\nOption D proposes formation of a transient triply-bridged intermediate via conversion of a terminal CO into a symmetric bridge. This increases bridging congestion and is not supported by the spectroscopic evidence for a semi-bridging, not fully symmetric bridging, transition state; it also implies an unnecessary increase in bridging that would raise the barrier.\n\nOption E suggests simple torsion about the Co-Co axis ejecting the bridges into terminal positions without a semi-bridging state, which contradicts the observation that the low-energy pathway proceeds via a semi-bridging CO transition state.\n\nTherefore, the only mechanism consistent with electron counting, low-energy intramolecular rearrangement, preservation of the Co-Co bond, and the spectroscopic identification of a semi-bridging CO in the transition state is the sequence described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2274129"}]}
