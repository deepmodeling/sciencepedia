Equivalence can arise from the static molecular symmetry in the slow-exchange limit and, in the fast-exchange limit, also from intramolecular processes that rapidly permute carbon positions relative to the NMR timescale. The cyclopentadienyl ligand $\\,\\mathrm{C}_{5}\\mathrm{H}_{5}^{-}\\,$ bound in $\\eta^{5}$ fashion presents five equivalent ring carbons (one resonance per $\\eta^{5}$ ligand set), while an $\\eta^{1}$-bound cyclopentadienyl ring has one Ti-bound ipso carbon, two equivalent ortho carbons, and two equivalent meta carbons (three resonances per $\\eta^{1}$ ligand set) in the absence of rapid site exchange around the ring.\n\nLow-temperature (slow-exchange) limit: The complex contains two $\\eta^{5}$ and two $\\eta^{1}$ cyclopentadienyl ligands. The spectroscopic structure implies a symmetry that renders the two $\\eta^{5}$ ligands equivalent to each other and the two $\\eta^{1}$ ligands equivalent to each other (e.g., a $C_{2}$ operation exchanging like ligands). Therefore:\n- All five carbons within an $\\eta^{5}$ ring are equivalent, and the two $\\eta^{5}$ rings are equivalent to each other, giving $1$ $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signal from the $\\eta^{5}$ set.\n- Each $\\eta^{1}$ ring has three distinct carbon environments (ipso, two ortho equivalent, two meta equivalent). Since the two $\\eta^{1}$ rings are equivalent, these three environments are not duplicated, giving $3$ $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signals from the $\\eta^{1}$ set.\nThus, the total number of signals at low temperature is $1+3=4$.\n\nHigh-temperature (fast-exchange) limit for the specified rearrangement: The problem states that a specific intramolecular rearrangement involving the $\\eta^{1}$-$\\mathrm{C}_{5}\\mathrm{H}_{5}$ ligands becomes very fast. The relevant process is a haptotropic/“ring-walking” migration of the Ti–C bond around each $\\eta^{1}$ ring that rapidly permutes the five ring carbons. In the fast-exchange limit, this process averages all five ring carbons within each $\\eta^{1}$ ligand, making them equivalent. Because the two $\\eta^{1}$ ligands are equivalent to each other, the $\\eta^{1}$ set contributes $1$ averaged $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signal. The $\\eta^{5}$ ligands remain $\\eta^{5}$ and equivalent, still contributing $1$ signal.
