The X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) region of the spectrum contains the \"absorption edge,\" which corresponds to the energy required to excite a core electron to a vacant orbital.

The technique used is Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, performed at the Platinum L₃ absorption edge. The EXAFS data, which is a function of the photoelectron wave number $k$, is analyzed by taking its Fourier Transform (FT).\n\nThe magnitude of the FT of an EXAFS spectrum yields a pseudo-radial distribution function, where peaks correspond to shells of atoms surrounding the central absorbing atom (in this case, Platinum). Two key principles govern the interpretation of this FT spectrum:\n1.  **Peak Position**: A peak in the FT appears at an apparent distance, $R$, which is shorter than the true interatomic distance, $r$, due to a phase shift effect. The relationship is approximately $R \\approx r - \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive phase shift value typically between 0.2 Å and 0.5 Å.\n2.  **Peak Amplitude**: The amplitude (or intensity) of a peak is proportional to the number of atoms in that shell and the backscattering strength of those atoms.
