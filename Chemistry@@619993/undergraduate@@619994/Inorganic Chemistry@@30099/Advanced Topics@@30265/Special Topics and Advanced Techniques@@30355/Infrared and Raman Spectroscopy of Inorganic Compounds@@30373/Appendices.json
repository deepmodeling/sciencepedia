The symmetric stretch gains IR intensity by borrowing it from the IR-active bending mode through a mechanism called Fermi resonance, which is significantly enhanced by the strong electronic interaction with the metal atom.\n\nC. The formation of the M-O-C-O adduct lowers the overall symmetry of the molecule, removing the center of inversion. In the new, lower-symmetry point group, the vibrational mode corresponding to the original symmetric stretch now transforms according to an irreducible representation that corresponds to a change in the dipole moment, making it IR-active.\n\nD.

The symmetric stretching mode $\\nu_{1}$ transforms as $\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$. Infrared activity of a vibrational mode requires that the mode transform as one of the Cartesian coordinates; specifically, the IR-active irreducible representations in $D_{\\infty h}$ are $\\Pi_{u}$ (for $x,y$) and $\\Sigma_{u}^{+}$ (for $z$).

The infrared intensity for a mode with normal coordinate $Q$ is proportional to\n$$\nI \\propto \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q}\\right|^{2},\n$$\nand a mode is IR-active if and only if $\\Gamma(Q)$ transforms like one of the components of the dipole moment $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ (i.e., $x$, $y$, or $z$). In $D_{\\infty h}$, $\\Gamma(Q_{\\nu_{1}})=\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$, which does not transform like any Cartesian coordinate; hence $\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q_{\\nu_{1}}}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ by symmetry, and the mode is IR-inactive.\n\nUpon complexation with the metal atom M to form an end-on, bent M–O–C–O adduct, the molecule is no longer linear and no longer has a center of inversion. The overall point group is reduced (often to $C_{s}$ or $C_{2v}$, depending on geometry). In such lower-symmetry, non-centrosymmetric groups, the mutual exclusion rule no longer applies, and modes that were previously gerade can become IR-active because their symmetry now matches that of one or more Cartesian coordinates. In correlation terms, the original $\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ mode of $\\text{CO}_{2}$ correlates to $A'$ in $C_{s}$ or $A_{1}$ in $C_{2v}$, both of which carry Cartesian vector character (for example, $A'$ carries in-plane components in $C_{s}$ and $A_{1}$ carries $z$ in $C_{2v}$).
