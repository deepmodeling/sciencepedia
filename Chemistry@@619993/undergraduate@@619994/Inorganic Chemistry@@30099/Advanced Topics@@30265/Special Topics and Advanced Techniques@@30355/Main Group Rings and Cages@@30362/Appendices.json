This gives the ring backbone: -S-O-S-O-S-O-.\nAdditionally, each sulfur atom is bonded to two terminal oxygen atoms.\n\nLet's focus on one of the sulfur atoms. It is bonded to two oxygen atoms within the ring and two terminal oxygen atoms. This means each sulfur atom forms a total of four single bonds in the initial skeletal structure.\n\nTo create a plausible Lewis structure, we distribute the remaining electrons and aim to minimize formal charges. Let's analyze one sulfur atom and its surrounding atoms. A structure that minimizes formal charge greatly involves sulfur expanding its octet. Sulfur is in the third period, so it is capable of having an expanded octet.\n\nConsider a sulfur atom forming two double bonds with its two terminal oxygen atoms and two single bonds with the two oxygen atoms in the ring.\n- The two terminal oxygen atoms would each have a double bond and 2 lone pairs.\n- The two ring oxygen atoms would each have two single bonds and 2 lone pairs.\n- The sulfur atom would have no lone pairs and form a total of 6 bonds (two single, two double).\n\nLet's calculate the formal charges for this arrangement:\n- Formal Charge (FC) = (Valence Electrons) - (Non-bonding Electrons) - (1/2 * Bonding Electrons)\n- FC for a terminal oxygen (O_t): $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\n- FC for a ring oxygen (O_r): $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\n- FC for a sulfur atom (S): $6 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(12) = 0$\n\nThis structure results in a formal charge of zero for all atoms, making it the most stable and preferred Lewis structure.\n\n**Step 3: Apply VSEPR theory to a sulfur atom.**\nAccording to VSEPR theory, the geometry around a central atom is determined by the number of electron domains (lone pairs and bonding regions). For VSEPR purposes, single, double, and triple bonds all count as a single bonding region.\n\nLet's analyze a central sulfur atom from our derived Lewis structure:\n- It is bonded to four other atoms (two ring oxygens and two terminal oxygens). This accounts for 4 bonding regions.\n- It has no lone pairs of electrons.\n- The total number of electron domains around the sulfur atom is $4 + 0 = 4$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the electron and molecular geometries.**\n- The arrangement of 4 electron domains that minimizes repulsion is a tetrahedral geometry. This is the **electron geometry**.\n- The **molecular geometry** describes the arrangement of only the atoms. When there are no lone pairs on the central atom, the molecular geometry is the same as the electron geometry.\n- Since the sulfur atom has 4 bonding domains and 0 lone pairs, the molecular geometry around each sulfur atom is **tetrahedral**.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2267264"}, {"introduction": "Having examined a ring structure, we now advance into three dimensions to explore molecular cages.

Isomers of both Nido and Arachno are formed.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the structural classification of the product formed from the two-electron oxidation of *nido*-$B_5H_9$ with a concurrent loss of two protons.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the chemical formula of the product.**\n\nWe start with the reactant, pentaborane(9), which has the formula $B_5H_9$. The process involves three components: the starting material, the species that are removed, and the final product.\nThe overall reaction can be written as:\n$$B_5H_9 \\rightarrow \\text{Product} + 2e^{-} + 2H^{+}$$\n\nTo find the formula of the product, which we can denote as $[B_xH_y]^z$, we must apply the principles of conservation of mass (for atoms) and conservation of charge.\n\n*   **Conservation of Boron Atoms:** The only source of boron is the starting material, $B_5H_9$. Since no boron atoms are lost, the number of boron atoms in the product must be the same as in the reactant.\n    $x = 5$\n\n*   **Conservation of Hydrogen Atoms:** The starting material has 9 hydrogen atoms. The reaction explicitly states that two protons ($H^+$), which are hydrogen nuclei, are liberated.\n    $y = 9 - 2 = 7$\n\n*   **Conservation of Charge:** The starting material, $B_5H_9$, is a neutral molecule, so its charge is 0. The species lost are two electrons ($2e^-$), with a total charge of $-2$, and two protons ($2H^+$), with a total charge of $+2$. The net charge of the species removed is $(-2) + (+2) = 0$.\n    Since the starting material is neutral and the net charge of the lost species is zero, the final product must also be neutral.\n    $z = 0$\n\nCombining these results, the chemical formula of the final product is $B_5H_7$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the structure of the product using Wade-Mingos rules.**\n\nNow we apply the Polyhedral Skeletal Electron Pair Theory (PSEPT) to classify the structure of the product, $B_5H_7$. PSEPT relies on counting the number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs) available for bonding within the cluster's framework.\n\nThe number of skeletal electrons can be calculated by summing the contributions from each atom or fragment and accounting for the overall charge. The rules for contribution are:\n*   Each B-H unit contributes $3 (\\text{from B}) - 1 (\\text{for the B-H bond}) = 2$ skeletal electrons.\n*   Each bridging H atom contributes $1$ skeletal electron.\n*   The charge $q$ on the cluster adds $-q$ electrons to the skeletal count (e.g., a 2- charge adds 2 electrons).\n\nA more direct method is to first calculate the total number of valence electrons (TVE) and then determine the skeletal electrons.\nFor the product $B_5H_7$:\n*   Number of boron atoms (vertices), $n = 5$.\n*   Total valence electrons (TVE) = (5 B atoms $\\times$ 3 valence $e^-$ each) + (7 H atoms $\\times$ 1 valence $e^-$ each)\n    $$TVE = (5 \\times 3) + (7 \\times 1) = 15 + 7 = 22$$\n\nFrom the TVE, we can calculate the number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs). In a borane cluster with $n$ boron atoms, each boron atom is assumed to utilize one orbital and two electrons to form a bond to an external atom/group (typically a terminal hydrogen). The remaining electrons form the skeleton.\n*   Number of electrons used in exocyclic B-H bonds = $2 \\times n = 2 \\times 5 = 10$ electrons.\n*   Number of skeletal electrons (SE) = TVE - (electrons in exocyclic bonds)\n*   This approach can be problematic if the number of terminal hydrogens is not equal to $n$. A more robust formulation for boranes is to represent the molecule as $[B_nH_n]^{c-}H_p$, where $H_p$ represents bridging hydrogens. The total number of skeletal electrons is $2n+2+c+p$.\n*   For $B_5H_7$, we can write it as $[B_5H_5]H_2$. This implies 5 terminal hydrogens and 2 bridging hydrogens.\n*   Skeletal electrons from the $[B_5H_5]$ core: Each B-H unit contributes 2 SEs. Total = $5 \\times 2 = 10$ SEs.\n*   Skeletal electrons from the 2 bridging hydrogens: Each bridging H contributes 1 SE. Total = $2 \\times 1 = 2$ SEs.\n*   Total Skeletal Electrons (SE) = $10 + 2 = 12$ SEs.\n\nThe number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs) is half the number of skeletal electrons.\n$$SEPs = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$$\n\n**Step 3: Correlate SEPs with the structural type.**\n\nAccording to Wade-Mingos rules, the structure of a cluster with $n$ vertices is determined by its number of SEPs:\n*   $n+1$ SEPs $\\rightarrow$ *closo* structure (a complete, closed deltahedron)\n*   $n+2$ SEPs $\\rightarrow$ *nido* structure (a deltahedron with one vertex missing)\n*   $n+3$ SEPs $\\rightarrow$ *arachno* structure (a deltahedron with two vertices missing)\n*   $n+4$ SEPs $\\rightarrow$ *hypho* structure (a deltahedron with three vertices missing)\n\nFor our product, we have:\n*   Number of vertices, $n = 5$.\n*   Number of SEPs = 6.\n\nComparing our result to the rules, we find that the number of SEPs is equal to $n+1$ (since $5+1=6$). This corresponds to a *closo* structure. The parent polyhedron for $n=5$ is a trigonal bipyramid. The oxidation of the *nido* cluster has resulted in a more compact *closo* framework.\n\nTherefore, the final product, $B_5H_7$, has a *closo* structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2267313"}]}
