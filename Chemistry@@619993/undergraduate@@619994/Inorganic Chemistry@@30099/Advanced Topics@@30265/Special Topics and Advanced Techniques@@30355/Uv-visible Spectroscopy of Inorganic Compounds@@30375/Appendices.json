This final practice delves into the fundamental selection rules that govern the intensity of absorption bands. By comparing the spectra of two cobalt(III) complexes with different symmetries—one perfectly octahedral ($O_h$) and one with lower symmetry ($C_{4v}$)—you will see how molecular geometry dictates whether a transition is \"allowed\" or \"forbidden\" by the Laporte rule, providing you with a deeper framework for interpreting and predicting the features of complex electronic spectra. [@problem_id:2297627]", "problem": "A chemist synthesizes two coordination complexes of cobalt(III). Complex A is hexaamminecobalt(III), $[\\text{Co(NH}_3)_6]^{3+}$, which adopts a perfectly octahedral ($O_h$) geometry. Complex B is chloropentaamminecobalt(III), $[\\text{Co(NH}_3)_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$, which has a lower symmetry (approximated as $C_{4v}$). Both are diamagnetic low-spin $d^6$ complexes. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra are recorded for aqueous solutions of both compounds.\n\nThe electronic transitions observed in these spectra can be classified as either d-d transitions within the cobalt ion's d-orbitals or as charge-transfer (CT) transitions between the metal and the ligands. The intensity of an absorption band is quantified by its molar absorptivity, $\\epsilon$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison of the expected features in the UV-Vis spectra of Complex A and Complex B?\n\nA. Complex A will exhibit more intense d-d absorption bands than Complex B because its higher symmetry allows for a larger number of possible electronic transitions.\n\nB. Both complexes will exhibit absorption bands of similar, high intensity ($\\epsilon > 1000$ L mol$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$) because d-d transitions in Co(III) complexes are always fully allowed.\n\nC. The spectrum of Complex B will be dominated by an intense metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band, whereas the spectrum of Complex A will only show very weak d-d bands.\n\nD. Complex A will show relatively weak d-d transitions. Complex B will show d-d transitions of significantly greater intensity than Complex A, and will also likely feature a very intense ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band involving the chloride ligand.\n\nE. The spectra of both complexes will be nearly identical, showing only two weak d-d absorption bands, as the substitution of a single ammine ligand with a chloride ligand is too small a perturbation to affect the electronic structure.", "solution": "For a low-spin $d^{6}$ octahedral cobalt(III) complex, the electronic configuration is $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$ with a singlet ground term. In $O_{h}$ symmetry, Complex A has ground state $^{1}A_{1g}$ and lowest-energy excited states derived from $t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{1}$ such as $^{1}T_{1g}$ and $^{1}T_{2g}$. The electric dipole transition moment is $\\mu_{if}\\propto\\langle \\psi_{f}|\\hat{\\mu}|\\psi_{i}\\rangle$. In centrosymmetric environments, the Laporte (parity) selection rule applies: electric dipole transitions require a change in parity ($g\\to u$ or $u\\to g$), while $g\\to g$ and $u\\to u$ are forbidden. Since both initial and final $d$-states are $g$, the d-d transitions in Complex A are Laporte forbidden, though they can gain weak intensity via vibronic coupling. Consequently, their molar absorptivities satisfy $\\epsilon\\ll 1000$ and are typically small.\n\nIn Complex B, the symmetry is approximated as $C_{4v}$, which lacks an inversion center. Without inversion symmetry, the Laporte rule does not strictly apply; odd-parity character can mix into the $d$-states, relaxing the parity restriction and enhancing d-d intensities. The spin selection rule $\\Delta S=0$ is still obeyed (singlet to singlet), so d-d transitions in Complex B are expected to be significantly more intense than in Complex A, though still generally weaker than fully allowed charge-transfer bands.\n\nCharge-transfer transitions are typically electric-dipole allowed and thus intense. For Co(III) with a halide ligand, ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) from the halide $p$-orbitals to the metal is favored because Co(III) is a strong electron acceptor and halides are good donors. An LMCT band involving chloride is therefore expected to be intense (with $\\epsilon\\gg 1000$) and can dominate the spectrum of Complex B. By contrast, metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) from Co(III) to ammine is disfavored because $\\text{NH}_3$ lacks low-lying acceptor orbitals, and MLCT to chloride is not meaningful since $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ is not an acceptor. Complex A, containing only ammine ligands, lacks a low-energy intense CT pathway in the visible; its spectrum is dominated by weak, Laporte-forbidden d-d bands.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: higher symmetry in $O_{h}$ enforces Laporte forbiddance and decreases, rather than increases, d-d intensity.\n- B is incorrect: d-d bands in Co(III) are not fully allowed; $\\epsilon$ is not generally greater than $1000$.\n- C is incorrect: the dominant CT in Complex B is LMCT (ligand to metal), not MLCT.\n- D is correct: Complex A shows weak d-d bands; Complex B shows more intense d-d bands due to loss of inversion symmetry and also a very intense LMCT band from Cl$^{-}$ to Co(III).\n- E is incorrect: the substitution of chloride significantly alters both symmetry (affecting selection rules) and introduces LMCT, so the spectra are not nearly identical.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2297627"}]}
