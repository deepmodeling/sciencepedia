A 1:3:3:1 quartet", "solution": "The multiplicity of a signal in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy due to spin-spin coupling is governed by the $2nI+1$ rule. In this rule, $n$ is the number of equivalent nuclei causing the splitting, and $I$ is their nuclear spin quantum number. The relative intensities of the peaks within the multiplet also depend on $n$ and $I$.\n\nFirst, let's verify this rule with the provided information for chloroform ($\\text{CHCl}_3$). The $^{13}\\text{C}$ nucleus is coupled to a single hydrogen atom ($n=1$). The nuclear spin $I$ for a proton ($^{1}\\text{H}$) is given as $1/2$.\nApplying the multiplicity rule:\nMultiplicity = $2nI + 1 = 2(1)(1/2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nThis predicts a doublet, which matches the problem description. For coupling to $n$ equivalent spin-1/2 nuclei, the relative intensities follow the coefficients of the binomial expansion, given by Pascal's triangle. For $n=1$, the ratio is 1:1. This confirms our understanding of the phenomenon.\n\nNow, we must apply the same principle to deuterochloroform ($\\text{CDCl}_3$). In this molecule, the $^{13}\\text{C}$ nucleus is bonded to a single deuterium atom ($n=1$). The problem states that the nuclear spin quantum number $I$ for deuterium ($^{2}\\text{H}$ or D) is $1$.\nUsing the $2nI+1$ rule for $\\text{CDCl}_3$:\nMultiplicity = $2nI + 1 = 2(1)(1) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nThis means the $^{13}\\text{C}$ signal will be split into a triplet.\n\nNext, we must determine the relative intensities of the three peaks in this triplet. The splitting is caused by the deuterium nucleus, which has three possible spin states corresponding to the magnetic quantum numbers $m_I = -1, 0, +1$. Since these spin states are almost equally populated under normal NMR conditions, the $^{13}\\text{C}$ nucleus experiences three slightly different local magnetic fields with nearly equal probability. This results in three peaks of approximately equal intensity. Therefore, the relative intensity ratio for a triplet arising from coupling to a single spin-1 nucleus is 1:1:1.\n\nThis prediction, a triplet with a 1:1:1 intensity ratio, matches option D.
