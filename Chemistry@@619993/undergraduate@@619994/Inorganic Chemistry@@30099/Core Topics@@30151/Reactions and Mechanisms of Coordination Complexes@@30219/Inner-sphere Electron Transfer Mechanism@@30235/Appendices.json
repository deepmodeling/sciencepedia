{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the inner-sphere mechanism begins with recognizing when it is, and is not, a viable pathway for electron transfer. This practice challenges you to apply the two crucial prerequisites for an inner-sphere reaction: the presence of a suitable bridging ligand and the substitutional lability of at least one of the metal centers. By comparing and contrasting several potential redox reactions, you will sharpen your ability to diagnose the most likely mechanism based on the fundamental structural and kinetic properties of coordination complexes [@problem_id:2260666].", "problem": "An inner-sphere electron transfer is a redox mechanism in which the oxidant and the reductant share a ligand in their inner coordination spheres, forming a bridged intermediate, before the electron is transferred. The formation of this bridge is a critical step. For the purpose of this problem, consider a metal complex to be \"substitutionally labile\" if it undergoes ligand exchange on a timescale of seconds or less, and \"substitutionally inert\" if its ligand exchange occurs on a timescale of many minutes, hours, or longer.\n\nConsider the following redox reactions between metal complexes. Which of these reactions is LEAST LIKELY to proceed via an inner-sphere mechanism?\n\nA. $[Co(NH_3)_5Cl]^{2+} + [Cr(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$\n\nB. $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{2+} + [Co(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$\n\nC. $[Co(CN)_6]^{3-} + [Ru(NH_3)_6]^{2+}$\n\nD. $[Ru(NH_3)_5(pyz)]^{2+} + [Cr(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ (where pyz is pyrazine, a bidentate-like bridging ligand)", "solution": "An inner-sphere electron transfer requires formation of a bridged intermediate, in which a ligand is coordinated to both the oxidant and the reductant. Formation of such a bridge is facilitated if at least one partner is substitutionally labile (able to undergo ligand exchange on a timescale of seconds or less) and if there is an available or pre-coordinated ligand that can act as a bridge (e.g., halides, hydroxo, oxo, or certain neutral donors like pyrazine). If both partners are substitutionally inert (ligand exchange on a timescale of many minutes, hours, or longer) and have fully saturated coordination spheres with nonbridging ligands, formation of the bridged intermediate is least likely, favoring an outer-sphere pathway instead.\n\nEvaluate each option against these criteria:\n\nA. In $[\\text{Co(NH}_3)_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+} + [\\text{Cr(H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$, the $Co(III)$ ammine complex is substitutionally inert, but the coordinated $Cl^{-}$ is a classical bridging ligand. The $Cr(II)$ aqua complex is substitutionally labile. Bridge formation via chloride from cobalt to chromium is well established (this is the prototypical Taube inner-sphere system), so an inner-sphere pathway is very likely.\n\nB. In $[\\text{Fe(H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+} + [\\text{Co(H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{3+}$, the $Fe(II)$ aqua complex is substitutionally labile, but the $Co(III)$ aqua complex is substitutionally inert. Both partners possess only water ligands, which are relatively poor for promoting inner-sphere electron transfer compared to halides or strongly bridging anions. Although in principle an aqua or hydroxo bridge could form by $Fe(II)$ binding to a water already coordinated to $Co(III)$ (not requiring ligand dissociation from $Co(III)$), the absence of a strong, preorganized bridging ligand makes an inner-sphere route disfavored. This suggests a preference for an outer-sphere mechanism, but we must compare with other options.\n\nC. In $[\\text{Co(CN)}_6]^{3-} + [\\text{Ru(NH}_3)_6]^{2+}$, both complexes are well known to be substitutionally inert: low-spin $Co(III)$ cyanide is extremely inert, and $[\\text{Ru(NH}_3)_6]^{2+}$ is also kinetically inert on the many minutes to hours timescale. While $CN^{-}$ can be a strong bridging ligand in general, forming a bridge here would require opening a coordination site on $[\\text{Ru(NH}_3)_6]^{2+}$. With both partners inert and no pre-existing bridging ligand that can bind without substitution at the second metal, the formation of a bridged intermediate is highly unlikely. Hence, an inner-sphere mechanism is least likely for this pair.\n\nD. In $[\\text{Ru(NH}_3)_5(\\text{pyz})]^{2+} + [\\text{Cr(H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$, pyrazine is an excellent bridging ligand because it has two donor nitrogens; it is already bound to $Ru(II)$ and can readily coordinate to the labile $Cr(II)$ to form a bridge without requiring substitution at ruthenium. With $Cr(II)$ labile and pyrazine predisposed to bridge, an inner-sphere pathway is very likely.\n\nComparing these, A and D are strongly predisposed to inner-sphere pathways due to an existing or very accessible bridging ligand and at least one labile partner. B is unfavorable for inner-sphere due to the weak bridging ability of aqua ligands and the inert $Co(III)$ partner, but C is even less favorable because both partners are substitutionally inert.
