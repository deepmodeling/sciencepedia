The kinetic rule is: a ligand trans to a stronger trans-directing ligand is substituted more rapidly. Using the given trans effect series $CN^{-} > I^{-} > Br^{-} > Cl^{-} > H_{2}O > NH_{3}$, $Cl^{-}$ is a stronger trans director than $NH_{3}$.\n\nRoute A proceeds stepwise from $[PdCl_{4}]^{2-}$ with one equivalent of $NH_{3}$, then a second equivalent:\nStep 1: \n$$[PdCl_{4}]^{2-} + NH_{3} \\rightarrow [PdCl_{3}(NH_{3})]^{-} + Cl^{-}.$$\nIn $[PdCl_{3}(NH_{3})]^{-}$, the single $NH_{3}$ is trans to one $Cl^{-}$, and there remain two $Cl^{-}$ ligands mutually trans. \nStep 2:\n$$[PdCl_{3}(NH_{3})]^{-} + NH_{3} \\rightarrow cis\\text{-}[PdCl_{2}(NH_{3})_{2}] + Cl^{-}.$$\nBy the trans effect, the $Cl^{-}$ trans to the strongest trans-directing ligand departs fastest. Since $Cl^{-}$ is stronger than $NH_{3}$, the $Cl^{-}$ trans to a $Cl^{-}$ is more labile than the $Cl^{-}$ trans to $NH_{3}$. Thus the incoming $NH_{3}$ replaces the $Cl^{-}$ trans to a $Cl^{-}$ and occupies a site trans to $Cl^{-}$, placing the two $NH_{3}$ ligands cis to each other. Therefore Route A yields *cis*-$[PdCl_2(NH_3)_2]$ selectively and efficiently.\n\nRoute B starts from $[Pd(NH_3)_4]^{2+}$ and adds $Cl^{-}$ twice:\n$$[Pd(NH_3)_4]^{2+} + Cl^{-} \\rightarrow [PdCl(NH_3)_3]^{+} + NH_{3},$$\nthen a second $Cl^{-}$ enters. Now $Cl^{-}$ is the strongest trans director present, so the ligand trans to $Cl^{-}$ (an $NH_{3}$) is labilized and replaced, placing the second $Cl^{-}$ trans to the first. This yields *trans*-$[PdCl_2(NH_3)_2]$, not the desired *cis* isomer.\n\nRoute C adds two equivalents of $NH_{3}$ simultaneously to $[PdCl_{4}]^{2-}$. This single-step approach lacks the stepwise control provided by the trans effect and typically gives mixtures; it is neither the mandated two-step sequence nor the most selective route to the *cis* product.\n\nRoute D first adds $Cl^{-}$ to $[PdCl_{4}]^{2-}$, which does not effect a substitution in square planar Pd(II) and at most shifts equilibria toward chlorido species. The subsequent addition of two equivalents of $NH_{3}$ in one operation again lacks stepwise trans-effect control and is not selective for the *cis* isomer.\n\nTherefore, only Route A uses the trans effect correctly to obtain *cis*-$[PdCl_2(NH_3)_2]$ selectively in two sequential steps.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2292878"}, {"introduction": "The *trans* effect can sometimes lead to surprising, non-intuitive outcomes that challenge a simple application of its rules.
