In coordination chemistry, thermodynamic stability refers to the extent to which a complex will form in a solution at equilibrium. This practice explores a powerful qualitative tool, the Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) principle, to predict which of two competing ligands will form the more thermodynamically stable complex with an iron(III) ion. Mastering this concept allows chemists to rationally design systems for applications like environmental remediation [@problem_id:2296701].", "problem": "An environmental chemist is investigating methods to remove toxic iron(III) ions from acidic wastewater. Two organic molecules are proposed as potential chelating agents: phenol ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH}$) and thiophenol ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{SH}$). In the target pH range, both molecules deprotonate to form their conjugate bases, the phenoxide ion ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^-$) and the thiophenoxide ion ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{S}^-$), which then act as ligands, binding to the $Fe^{3+}$ ion.\n\nTo develop an effective remediation strategy, the chemist needs to predict which ligand will form a more thermodynamically stable complex with the $Fe^{3+}$ ion. Based on fundamental principles of coordination chemistry, which of the following statements correctly predicts the relative stability and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. The $Fe^{3+}$ complex with phenoxide is more thermodynamically stable because $Fe^{3+}$ is a hard acid and the phenoxide ion is a hard base.\n\nB. The $Fe^{3+}$ complex with thiophenoxide is more thermodynamically stable because $Fe^{3+}$ is a soft acid and the thiophenoxide ion is a soft base.\n\nC. The $Fe^{3+}$ complex with thiophenoxide is more thermodynamically stable because the sulfur donor atom in thiophenoxide is more polarizable than the oxygen donor in phenoxide, leading to stronger covalent bonding.\n\nD. The $Fe^{3+}$ complex with phenoxide is more thermodynamically stable because the smaller size of the oxygen donor atom compared to sulfur leads to significantly less steric hindrance.\n\nE. The thermodynamic stabilities of the two complexes are expected to be nearly identical because oxygen and sulfur are in the same group of the periodic table, resulting in similar Lewis basicity.", "solution": "We identify the governing principle as the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) concept, which states that hard acids preferentially bind hard bases and soft acids preferentially bind soft bases, leading to greater thermodynamic stability (larger formation constants) for matched hard–hard or soft–soft pairs, and lower stability for hard–soft mismatches.\n\nClassify the metal center: $Fe^{3+}$ has a high positive charge, relatively small ionic radius, high charge density, and low polarizability; these properties define a hard Lewis acid.\n\nClassify the ligands by their donor atoms. The phenoxide ion donates through oxygen; oxygen donors are typically hard bases because oxygen is small, highly electronegative, and not very polarizable. The thiophenoxide ion donates through sulfur; sulfur donors are typically soft bases because sulfur is larger and more polarizable, favoring covalent interactions with soft acids.\n\nApply HSAB: A hard acid such as $Fe^{3+}$ will preferentially form more thermodynamically stable complexes with hard bases (oxygen donors) rather than with soft bases (sulfur donors). Therefore, the $Fe^{3+}$ complex with phenoxide is expected to be more stable than that with thiophenoxide.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A correctly states that $Fe^{3+}$ is a hard acid and phenoxide is a hard base, predicting a more stable complex.\n- B is incorrect because $Fe^{3+}$ is not a soft acid.\n- C is incorrect in this context: although sulfur is more polarizable and can form more covalent bonds, that favors binding to soft acids, not to the hard acid $Fe^{3+}$.\n- D invokes sterics, which are secondary here and do not override the HSAB-driven preference.\n- E is incorrect because oxygen and sulfur, while in the same group, have significantly different electronegativity and polarizability, leading to different HSAB classifications and different stabilities.\n\nThus, the correct prediction and reasoning are given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2296701"}, {"introduction": "While thermodynamics tells us the final destination of a reaction, kinetics tells us how fast we will get there.
