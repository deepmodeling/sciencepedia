A chemist is investigating a specific synthetic pathway to generate a diamminedichloridoplatinum(II) complex, a class of compounds known for potential therapeutic applications. The synthesis begins with an aqueous solution of the tetraammineplatinum(II) cation, $[Pt(NH_3)_4]^{2+}$. This starting material is then reacted sequentially with two molar equivalents of chloride ions ($Cl^-$) under conditions that favor stepwise ligand substitution and are governed by kinetic control.\n\nPredict the major geometric isomer of the final neutral product, $[Pt(NH_3)_2Cl_2]$, that is formed.\n\nA.

A different complex, $[PtCl_4]^{2-}$, is formed.", "solution": "Platinum(II) complexes are $d^{8}$ and adopt square planar geometry. Substitution at square planar $d^{8}$ centers such as $Pt^{2+}$ proceeds by an associative mechanism (denoted $A_{N}$), often via a five-coordinate transition state or intermediate with trigonal bipyramidal character. The stereochemical outcome under kinetic control is governed by the trans effect: a ligand already bound to the metal accelerates substitution of the ligand trans to itself. The magnitude of the trans effect follows the empirical series in which $Cl^{-}$ exerts a stronger trans effect than $NH_{3}$ (for example, $I^{-} > Br^{-} > Cl^{-} > NH_{3}$).\n\nStarting from the tetraammine complex, the first substitution by chloride occurs without stereochemical bias because all four $NH_{3}$ ligands are equivalent:\n$$\n[Pt(NH_{3})_{4}]^{2+} + Cl^{-} \\xrightarrow{A_{N}} [Pt(NH_{3})_{3}Cl]^{+} + NH_{3}.\n$$\nIn the intermediate $[Pt(NH_{3})_{3}Cl]^{+}$, the coordinated $Cl^{-}$ has a stronger trans effect than $NH_{3}$. Therefore, in the second substitution step, the site trans to the existing $Cl^{-}$ is labilized and the incoming $Cl^{-}$ preferentially replaces the $NH_{3}$ trans to the first $Cl^{-}$:\n$$\n[Pt(NH_{3})_{3}Cl]^{+} + Cl^{-} \\xrightarrow{A_{N},\\, \\text{trans effect of } Cl^{-}} [Pt(NH_{3})_{2}Cl_{2}] + NH_{3}.\n$$\nBecause the second chloride enters trans to the first chloride, the product has the two chlorides opposite each other, giving the trans isomer. Under kinetic control, this directed pathway dominates and yields the trans product rather than the cis isomer. Only two equivalents of $Cl^{-}$ are used, so neither complete chlorination to $[PtCl_{4}]^{2-}$ nor recovery of starting material is expected.\n\nTherefore, the major geometric isomer formed is the trans isomer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2265735"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of directed synthesis, we now delve deeper into the kinetic consequences of the trans effect. This effect is not simply an \"on/off\" switch; it is a graded scale of influence where some ligands are far more effective at labilizing their trans partners than others.
