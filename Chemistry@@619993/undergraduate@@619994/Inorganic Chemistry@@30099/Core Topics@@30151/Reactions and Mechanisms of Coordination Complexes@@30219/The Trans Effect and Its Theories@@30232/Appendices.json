A key kinetic phenomenon in these reactions is the trans effect: a ligand already bound to $\\mathrm{Pt(II)}$ accelerates substitution of the ligand trans to itself. The strength of this effect depends on the ligand and is ordered in the trans-directing series. Closely related is the trans influence (a ground-state weakening of the bond trans to a given ligand), but for sequencing substitutions the kinetic trans effect is decisive.\n\nStep 2: Connect the trans effect to synthetic control of geometry.\nBecause the ligand trans to a strong trans director is replaced fastest, one can control which position is substituted at each step by choosing which ligand occupies the site trans to the leaving group. Therefore, to place a specific ligand trans to another in the final square planar product, one typically:\n- Introduces a strong trans-directing ligand early, so that the next entering ligand is installed trans to it due to the enhanced rate for substitution at that position.\n- Continues substitutions with knowledge of relative trans effects to avoid scrambling and to favor the desired trans relationships.\nThis strategy requires knowing the relative trans-directing strengths of the ligands involved, i.e., the trans-directing series.\n\nStep 3: Apply to the given ligand set and justify why that ranking is the critical information.\nAmong $\\mathrm{NO_{2}^{-}}$, $\\mathrm{py}$, $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$, and $\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$, the trans effect generally follows that $\\mathrm{NO_{2}^{-}}$ and soft, $\\pi$-accepting ligands are stronger trans directors than $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$, which in turn is stronger than $\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$; $\\mathrm{py}$ is typically intermediate, stronger than $\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$ and comparable to or weaker than $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ depending on conditions. Knowing this order is essential for deciding which ligand to install first to direct the next substitution trans to it, and thus to ensure that the target ligand pairs end up trans in the desired geometric isomer.\n\nStep 4: Exclude the alternative options by showing they do not provide the requisite kinetic positional control.\n- Spectrochemical series (option B) ranks ligands by field strength (d-orbital splitting), relevant to octahedral crystal field stabilization and spin states, not the kinetic directionality of substitution at square planar $\\mathrm{Pt(II)}$.\n- Steric bulk or Tolman cone angles (option C) are most relevant for phosphines and do not systematically control which site is substituted in square planar $\\mathrm{Pt(II)}$ with small ligands like $\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$, $\\mathrm{py}$, $\\mathrm{NO_{2}^{-}}$, and $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$.\n- Formal ligand charges (option D) affect overall complex charge and sometimes rates via ion-pairing or medium effects but do not dictate the specific trans relationships formed during stepwise substitution.\n- Conjugate-acid $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ values (option E) describe Br√∏nsted acidity/basicity in solution and are not the determining factor for the kinetic trans-directing control in square planar substitution sequences.\n\nTherefore, the most critical information for planning the sequence to obtain a specific geometric isomer is the trans-directing series, i.e., option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2296167"}, {"introduction": "With the importance of the trans-directing series established, let's apply it to a practical scenario.

In $[PtCl_{3}(NH_{3})]^{-}$, the three $Cl^{-}$ ligands include one trans to $NH_{3}$ and two trans to $Cl^{-}$. Because $Cl^{-}  NH_{3}$, the bond trans to $Cl^{-}$ is more labile, so $py$ replaces a $Cl^{-}$ trans to $Cl^{-}$. The resulting $[PtCl_{2}(NH_{3})(py)]$ has $py$ cis to $NH_{3}$.

With $Cl^{-}$ and $py$ present, $Cl^{-}$ is the stronger trans director.\nStep 2: Add $NH_{3}$. In $[PtCl_{3}(py)]^{-}$, one $Cl^{-}$ is trans to $py$ and two $Cl^{-}$ are trans to $Cl^{-}$.

Among $py$ and $NH_{3}$, $py  NH_{3}$, so the ligand trans to $py$ (an $NH_{3}$) is labilized and is replaced, giving $[Pt(NH_{3})_{2}(py)Cl]^{+}$ with $Cl^{-}$ trans to $py$.\nStep 2: Add $Cl^{-}$. Now the strongest trans director present is $Cl^{-}$ (since $Cl^{-}  py  NH_{3}$). The ligand trans to $Cl^{-}$ is $py$, so $py$ is replaced, yielding $[Pt(NH_{3})_{2}Cl_{2}]$, not the target mixed-ligand complex.
