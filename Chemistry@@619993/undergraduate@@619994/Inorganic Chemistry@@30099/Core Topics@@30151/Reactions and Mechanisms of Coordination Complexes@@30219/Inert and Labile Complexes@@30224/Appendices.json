A stronger bond leads to a more inert complex (slower exchange), while a weaker bond results in a more labile complex (faster exchange).

Complex A is more labile because the loss of a ligand causes a smaller, and therefore less energetically costly, change in its Ligand Field Stabilization Energy.\n\nE. Complex B is more labile because the electronic rearrangement upon forming the five-coordinate transition state results in a much smaller loss (or even a gain) of Ligand Field Stabilization Energy compared to Complex A.", "solution": "We are asked to compare the kinetic lability of two strong-field octahedral complexes, Complex A with a $d^{3}$ metal and Complex B with a $d^{8}$ metal, under a dissociative (D) mechanism involving a five-coordinate transition state. The most accurate ligand field rationale must consider how the Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE) changes when the coordination number drops from six to five.\n\n1) Octahedral ground-state LFSEs.\n\nIn an octahedral field, the $d$ orbitals split into $t_{2g}$ (lower) and $e_{g}$ (upper) with energies $-0.4\\Delta_{o}$ and $+0.6\\Delta_{o}$, respectively. Thus, for an electron configuration $t_{2g}^{n_{t}}e_{g}^{n_{e}}$, the octahedral LFSE is\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}=( -0.4\\Delta_{o})\\,n_{t} + ( +0.6\\Delta_{o})\\,n_{e}.\n$$\nFor $d^{3}$ (Complex A): $n_{t}=3$, $n_{e}=0$, so\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{3})=3(-0.4\\Delta_{o})=-1.2\\Delta_{o}.\n$$\nFor $d^{8}$ (Complex B): $n_{t}=6$, $n_{e}=2$, so\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{8})=6(-0.4\\Delta_{o})+2(+0.6\\Delta_{o})=-2.4\\Delta_{o}+1.2\\Delta_{o}=-1.2\\Delta_{o}.\n$$\nTherefore, both have the same octahedral ground-state LFSE:\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{3})=\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{8})=-1.2\\Delta_{o}.\n$$\nThis directly invalidates any claim that one is more labile solely because its octahedral ground state is less stabilized (option A), and shows that equal ground-state LFSE alone does not ensure similar lability (option B), because the mechanism depends on the five-coordinate transition state.\n\n2) Dissociative mechanism and LFSE change upon forming a five-coordinate transition state.\n\nFor a dissociative (D) pathway, the activation barrier contains a ligand-field contribution that is governed by the LFSE change upon losing one ligand to form the five-coordinate transition state (5C-TS). Define\n$$\n\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{LFSE}}=\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}-\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}.\n$$\nA smaller or more negative $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{LFSE}}$ lowers the barrier and increases lability; a larger positive value raises the barrier and decreases lability.\n\nThe five-coordinate transition state for octahedral dissociation is commonly square pyramidal (SP) when a trans ligand dissociates, although trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) is also possible. The qualitative ligand field splittings are:\n- In SP, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ is highest; $d_{z^{2}}$ is lowered relative to its octahedral $e_{g}$ energy because one axial ligand is removed; the remaining three orbitals are lower still. Thus, the strongly antibonding character associated with $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ can be left unoccupied if electron count permits.\n- In TBP, $d_{z^{2}}$ (often labeled $a_{1}^{\\prime}$) is highest; the two $e$ sets are lower. Either way, relative to the octahedral case, the net antibonding character of the $e_{g}$-derived orbitals is reduced in the five-coordinate field.\n\n3) Consequences for $d^{3}$ versus $d^{8}$ in the 5C-TS.\n\n- For $d^{3}$: In the octahedral ground state, all three electrons occupy $t_{2g}$ orbitals at $-0.4\\Delta_{o}$. Upon forming the 5C-TS, the $t_{2g}$-derived set splits and at least one electron is promoted into an orbital that is less stabilizing than $-0.4\\Delta_{o}$ (because the symmetry lowering and reduced coordination raise some of the $t_{2g}$-derived energies relative to the octahedral case). Symbolically, if the three lowest 5C orbital energies are $E_{1}$, $E_{2}$, $E_{3}$ (relative to the barycenter, with $E_{1}\\leq E_{2}\\leq E_{3}$), then\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}(d^{3})=E_{1}+E_{2}+E_{3},\n$$\nwith\n$$\nE_{1}+E_{2}+E_{3}>3(-0.4\\Delta_{o})=-1.2\\Delta_{o}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\n\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{LFSE}}(d^{3})=\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}(d^{3})-\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{3})>0,\n$$\ni.e., there is a loss of LFSE (an energetic penalty) upon forming the 5C-TS, which disfavors dissociation kinetically.\n\n- For $d^{8}$: In the octahedral ground state, two electrons occupy $e_{g}$ antibonding orbitals at $+0.6\\Delta_{o}$. In the SP 5C-TS, one $e_{g}$-derived orbital ($d_{z^{2}}$) is stabilized substantially relative to $+0.6\\Delta_{o}$ (call this lowering $\\delta>0$), while the other ($d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$) remains strongly antibonding and can be left empty for $d^{8}$. Denote the SP energies schematically by\n$$\nE(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}})=+0.6\\Delta_{o}+\\epsilon,\\quad E(d_{z^{2}})=+0.6\\Delta_{o}-\\delta,\n$$\nwith $\\epsilon>0$ and $\\delta>0$, and the remaining three orbitals below. For $d^{8}$ in a strong field, the eight electrons can fully occupy the four lower-energy orbitals (including $d_{z^{2}}$) and leave the highest orbital $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ empty. Thus, relative to the octahedral case where both $e_{g}$ orbitals are occupied at $+0.6\\Delta_{o}$ each, the 5C-TS reduces or removes occupancy of the most antibonding level. Consequently,\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}(d^{8})\\leq \\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{8}),\n$$\nso that\n$$\n\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{LFSE}}(d^{8})=\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}(d^{8})-\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{8})\\leq 0.\n$$\nIn words: the LFSE loss on going to the 5C-TS is much smaller for $d^{8}$ than for $d^{3}$, and can even become a net gain (especially for an SP-like TS), which lowers the activation barrier and increases lability.\n\n4) Evaluation of the statements.\n\n- A is false because both have the same octahedral LFSE, so A’s premise is incorrect.\n- B is incomplete/incorrect for kinetics under a D mechanism since the relevant comparison is the LFSE change to the 5C-TS, not just the ground-state LFSE.\n- C is an oversimplification for a D mechanism; although $e_{g}$ occupancy weakens bonds, the decisive factor is the LFSE difference to the 5C-TS, which is better captured by E.\n- D is false; $d^{3}$ suffers a larger LFSE loss on 5C formation than $d^{8}$.\n- E correctly states that $d^{8}$ is more labile because formation of the 5C transition state entails a much smaller LFSE loss (and often a gain) relative to the octahedral ground state, whereas $d^{3}$ incurs a significant LFSE penalty.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2259729"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are powerful, but they must be validated by experiment.
