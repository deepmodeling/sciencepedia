To understand their chemical behavior, a detailed knowledge of their electronic structure is essential. Consider the most stable resonance structure for the $[P_3O_9]^{3-}$ ion, which has a cyclic backbone of alternating phosphorus and oxygen atoms. Assuming the structure adheres to the principle of formal charge minimization and allows for expanded octets on third-period elements, determine the following three quantities:\n1. The total count of phosphorus-oxygen single bonds (P-O).\n2. The total count of phosphorus-oxygen double bonds (P=O).\n3. The total count of valence electron lone pairs on all atoms in the ion.", "solution": "The problem asks for three structural quantities of the most stable resonance structure of the cyclic trimetaphosphate ion, $[P_3O_9]^{3-}$. We need to draw the Lewis structure that minimizes formal charges.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of valence electrons.**\nPhosphorus (P) is in Group 15, so it has 5 valence electrons.\nOxygen (O) is in Group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\nThe ion has 3 phosphorus atoms, 9 oxygen atoms, and a charge of -3.\nTotal valence electrons = ($3 \\times 5$) + ($9 \\times 6$) + 3 (for the charge)\nTotal valence electrons = $15 + 54 + 3 = 72$ electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the skeletal structure.**\nThe problem states that the ion has a cyclic backbone of alternating phosphorus and oxygen atoms. This means we have a six-membered ring: P-O-P-O-P-O. The remaining oxygen atoms must be attached to the phosphorus atoms, as phosphorus is less electronegative than oxygen and can accommodate more bonds. With 3 P atoms and 9 O atoms total, and 3 O atoms in the ring, there are $9 - 3 = 6$ oxygen atoms left. These must be distributed among the 3 P atoms, so each P atom is bonded to 2 terminal oxygen atoms.\nThe skeleton consists of 6 single bonds forming the ring (3 P-O and 3 O-P) and 6 single bonds connecting the phosphorus atoms to the terminal oxygen atoms (3 P atoms $\\times$ 2 terminal O atoms).\nTotal bonds in skeleton = $6 + 6 = 12$ single bonds.\nElectrons used in the skeleton = $12 \\times 2 = 24$ electrons.\n\n**Step 3: Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs.**\nElectrons remaining = Total valence electrons - Electrons in skeleton\nElectrons remaining = $72 - 24 = 48$ electrons.\nWe distribute these electrons to the most electronegative atoms (the oxygen atoms) first to satisfy their octets.\n-   The 3 oxygen atoms within the ring are each bonded to two phosphorus atoms (4 bonding electrons). To complete their octets, they each need 2 lone pairs (4 non-bonding electrons).\n    Electrons for ring oxygens = $3 \\times 4 = 12$ electrons.\n-   The 6 terminal oxygen atoms are each bonded to one phosphorus atom (2 bonding electrons). To complete their octets, they each need 3 lone pairs (6 non-bonding electrons).\n    Electrons for terminal oxygens = $6 \\times 6 = 36$ electrons.\nTotal electrons distributed as lone pairs = $12 + 36 = 48$ electrons.\nThis uses up all the remaining electrons.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate formal charges to assess the stability of this initial structure.**\nThe formula for formal charge is: FC = (Valence e⁻) - (Non-bonding e⁻) - $\\frac{1}{2}$(Bonding e⁻).\n-   For each of the 3 ring oxygens: FC = $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$.\n-   For each of the 6 terminal, singly-bonded oxygens: FC = $6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$.\n-   For each of the 3 phosphorus atoms (each bonded to 2 ring O's and 2 terminal O's, all single bonds): FC = $5 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = +1$.\nThe net charge of the ion is $(3 \\times 0) + (6 \\times -1) + (3 \\times +1) = -3$, which is correct. However, this structure has a significant separation of charge (+1 on all P atoms, -1 on all terminal O atoms).\n\n**Step 5: Minimize formal charges by forming double bonds.**\nTo create a more stable resonance structure, we should minimize the formal charges. Since phosphorus is in the third period, it can have an expanded octet. We can reduce the formal charge by converting a lone pair from a terminal oxygen atom with a -1 FC into a bonding pair with an adjacent phosphorus atom with a +1 FC. This forms a P=O double bond.\nTo neutralize the +1 formal charge on each of the 3 phosphorus atoms, we can form one P=O double bond for each P atom. This involves one of the two terminal oxygen atoms for each phosphorus. The result is a structure where each P atom forms a double bond with one terminal oxygen and a single bond with another.\nLet's recalculate the formal charges for this new structure:\n-   The 3 ring oxygens are unchanged: FC = 0.\n-   The structure now contains three terminal oxygens with single bonds and three with double bonds.\n-   For the 3 terminal oxygens with single bonds: They still have 3 lone pairs. FC = $6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$.\n-   For the 3 terminal oxygens with double bonds: They now have 2 lone pairs. FC = $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$.\n-   For each of the 3 phosphorus atoms: Each is now bonded to 2 ring O's (single), 1 terminal O (single), and 1 terminal O (double). Total bonding electrons = $2+2+2+4=10$. FC = $5 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(10) = 0$.\nThis structure has a net charge of $3 \\times (-1) = -3$, and the formal charges are minimized (zero on 9 atoms, -1 on 3 atoms). This is the most stable resonance structure.\n\n**Step 6: Count the required quantities from the stable structure.**\n1.  **Phosphorus-oxygen single bonds (P-O):** There are 6 single bonds in the P-O-P ring, and 3 single bonds connecting P atoms to terminal O atoms. \n    Total P-O single bonds = $6 + 3 = 9$.\n2.  **Phosphorus-oxygen double bonds (P=O):** There are 3 P=O double bonds, one for each P atom, connected to a terminal O atom.\n    Total P=O double bonds = 3.\n3.  **Total valence electron lone pairs:**\n    -   On the 3 ring oxygens: $3 \\times 2 = 6$ lone pairs.\n    -   On the 3 terminal singly-bonded oxygens: $3 \\times 3 = 9$ lone pairs.\n    -   On the 3 terminal doubly-bonded oxygens: $3 \\times 2 = 6$ lone pairs.\n    -   On the 3 phosphorus atoms: 0 lone pairs.\n    Total lone pairs = $6 + 9 + 6 = 21$.\n\nThe three requested quantities are 9, 3, and 21.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 3 & 21 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2281299"}, {"introduction": "A chemical formula alone can sometimes be misleading; the actual arrangement of atoms determines a molecule's properties.

It is stated that H₃PO₃ is a diprotic acid.\n\nFirst, we write the chemical equations for the two-step neutralization process:\n1.  H₃PO₃(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂PO₃⁻(aq) + H₂O(l)\n2.  H₂PO₃⁻(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → HPO₃²⁻(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\nThe second equivalence point is reached when all the initial H₃PO₃ has been completely converted to the phosphite ion, HPO₃²⁻. This stoichiometry requires the addition of two moles of OH⁻ for every mole of H₃PO₃ initially present.\n\nWe begin by calculating the initial number of moles of H₃PO₃.\nGiven an initial acid concentration, $C_a = 0.1000$ M, and an initial acid volume, $V_a = 50.00$ mL = $0.05000$ L.\nThe initial moles of H₃PO₃ are:\n$$ \\text{moles of H}_3\\text{PO}_3 = C_a \\times V_a = (0.1000 \\text{ mol/L}) \\times (0.05000 \\text{ L}) = 0.005000 \\text{ mol} $$\n\nTo reach the second equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added must be twice the initial moles of H₃PO₃:\n$$ \\text{moles of NaOH} = 2 \\times 0.005000 \\text{ mol} = 0.01000 \\text{ mol} $$\n\nNext, we find the volume of the NaOH solution required.
