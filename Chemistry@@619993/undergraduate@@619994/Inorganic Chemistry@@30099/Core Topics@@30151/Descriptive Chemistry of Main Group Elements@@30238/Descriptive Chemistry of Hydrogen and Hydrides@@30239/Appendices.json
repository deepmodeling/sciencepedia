[@problem_id:2247198]", "problem": "Methane ($CH_4$), the primary component of natural gas, is kinetically stable in the presence of atmospheric oxygen at room temperature and requires an ignition source, such as a spark, to combust. In stark contrast, silane ($SiH_4$) is pyrophoric, meaning it ignites spontaneously upon contact with air. This question explores the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic reasons for this dramatic difference in reactivity.\n\nConsider the complete combustion reactions for methane and silane:\n$CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \\rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(g)$\n$SiH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \\rightarrow SiO_2(s) + 2H_2O(g)$\n\nUse the following average bond enthalpy data (in kJ/mol) to assist your analysis.

The oxidation of silane is significantly more thermodynamically favorable than that of methane. This large thermodynamic driving force, combined with a much lower kinetic activation barrier for the reaction of silane with oxygen, accounts for its pyrophoricity.\n\nB. Although both reactions are thermodynamically favorable, the oxidation of methane is substantially more exothermic than that of silane. The extreme reactivity of silane is therefore a purely kinetic phenomenon, unrelated to the reaction's thermodynamics.\n\nC. The thermodynamic driving forces for the oxidation of methane and silane are very similar. The observed difference in reactivity is due entirely to kinetics, as the activation barrier for silane oxidation is exceptionally low while the barrier for methane oxidation is very high.\n\nD. The kinetic activation barriers for the reaction of both hydrides with oxygen are comparable. The reason for silane's pyrophoricity is that its oxidation is an enormously exothermic process, while the oxidation of methane is only marginally exothermic.\n\nE. The oxidation of silane is thermodynamically favorable and kinetically accessible, whereas the oxidation of methane is kinetically hindered and thermodynamically unfavorable, preventing it from reacting spontaneously with air.", "solution": "We analyze thermodynamic driving forces by estimating reaction enthalpies via average bond enthalpies, using the relation\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} \\approx \\sum \\text{(bonds broken)} - \\sum \\text{(bonds formed)}.\n$$\nFor methane combustion, $CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \\rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(g)$:\n- Bonds broken: $4$ C–H and $2$ O=O, giving\n$$\n\\sum \\text{broken} = 4\\times 413 + 2\\times 498 = 1652 + 996 = 2648.\n$$\n- Bonds formed: in $CO_2$, $2$ C=O; in $2H_2O$, $4$ O–H, giving\n$$\n\\sum \\text{formed} = 2\\times 804 + 4\\times 467 = 1608 + 1868 = 3476.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}(CH_4) \\approx 2648 - 3476 = -828.\n$$\n\nFor silane combustion, $SiH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \\rightarrow SiO_2(s) + 2H_2O(g)$, approximating $SiO_2$ formation as $4$ Si–O single bonds per formula unit:\n- Bonds broken: $4$ Si–H and $2$ O=O, giving\n$$\n\\sum \\text{broken} = 4\\times 323 + 2\\times 498 = 1292 + 996 = 2288.\n$$\n- Bonds formed: in $SiO_2$, $4$ Si–O; in $2H_2O$, $4$ O–H, giving\n$$\n\\sum \\text{formed} = 4\\times 466 + 4\\times 467 = 1864 + 1868 = 3732.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}(SiH_4) \\approx 2288 - 3732 = -1444.\n$$\n\nComparison shows the silane oxidation enthalpy is more negative by about\n$$\n(-1444) - (-828) = -616,\n$$\nindicating a substantially larger thermodynamic driving force for $SiH_4$ oxidation. This is consistent with the formation of very strong Si–O bonds in a network solid.\n\nNext, we consider kinetic barriers. The initial activation step for hydrocarbon oxidation with ground-state $O_2$ typically requires radical initiation because $O_2$ is a triplet and direct insertion into strong C–H bonds is inhibited. Methane has strong C–H bonds ($413$), which makes hydrogen abstraction and radical initiation difficult at room temperature without an ignition source. In contrast, silane has weaker Si–H bonds ($323$), facilitating H-abstraction and radical formation. Furthermore, the high exothermicity and the strong stabilization upon forming Si–O bonds lower the effective activation barrier for propagation steps, enabling rapid, self-sustaining reaction upon exposure to air. Therefore, silane oxidation is both more thermodynamically favorable and kinetically accessible, while methane oxidation, though clearly exothermic, faces a much higher kinetic barrier at room temperature and requires initiation.\n\nAmong the given statements, this aligns with the claim that silane oxidation is significantly more thermodynamically favorable and has a much lower kinetic activation barrier, accounting for pyrophoricity, whereas methane oxidation is thermodynamically favorable but kinetically hindered at room temperature.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2247198"}, {"introduction": "In modern inorganic chemistry, definitively identifying the structure of a newly synthesized molecule is paramount.
