Each F requires $6$ electrons as three lone pairs, so $4 \\times 6 = 24$ electrons are placed on fluorines, leaving $32 - 24 = 8$ electrons. Placing $6$ electrons on O (as three lone pairs) would complete its octet with a single bond, leaving $2$ electrons for Xe as one lone pair. This single-bond structure gives formal charges: on O, $\\text{FC} = 6 - (6 + 1) = -1$; on Xe, $\\text{FC} = 8 - (2 + 5) = +1$.
