While difunctional monomers create long, linear chains that behave as viscous liquids, the introduction of a trifunctional monomer can have a profound effect. This problem [@problem_id:2287762] presents a hypothetical scenario that illustrates the power of cross-linking, providing a conceptual link between the microscopic structure of a polymer network and its macroscopic state as a solid gel.", "problem": "The synthesis of polydimethylsiloxane, a common type of silicone oil, is achieved through the hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of dimethyldichlorosilane, $(CH_3)_2SiCl_2$. This process typically yields long, linear polymer chains, resulting in a product that is a viscous liquid at room temperature. A chemical engineer attempts to modify the process by adding a small quantity of methyltrichlorosilane, $CH_3SiCl_3$, to the initial reaction mixture along with the dimethyldichlorosilane. Upon carrying out the hydrolysis and condensation, the resulting silicone product is observed to be a rigid, solid gel, rather than a liquid.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct chemical reason for this change in the physical properties of the resulting polymer?\n\nA. The methyltrichlorosilane monomer has three reactive sites, which creates covalent cross-links between the polymer chains, forming a rigid three-dimensional network.\n\nB. The methyltrichlorosilane acts as a powerful catalyst for the condensation reaction, drastically increasing the average length and molecular weight of the linear polymer chains, leading to solidification through entanglement.\n\nC. The methyltrichlorosilane acts as a chain-terminating agent, producing very short oligomers that can pack efficiently into a crystalline solid structure.\n\nD. The single methyl group on the methyltrichlorosilane is more sterically accessible, leading to a much faster polymerization rate and the rapid formation of an amorphous solid.\n\nE. The incorporation of methyltrichlorosilane units removes a methyl group at various points along the chain, reducing intermolecular repulsion and allowing the polymer chains to pack together more tightly into a solid.", "solution": "The hydrolysis of difunctional dimethyldichlorosilane produces a difunctional silanediol that undergoes condensation to give linear polysiloxanes.

In step-growth terms, the presence of any fraction $x$ of $f=3$ units among predominantly $f=2$ units raises the average functionality to\n$$\n\\langle f \\rangle = 2(1-x) + 3x = 2 + x,\n$$\nand Flory–Stockmayer theory predicts gelation when the branching coefficient reaches unity, which in a mixed $f=2$/$f=3$ system occurs at a finite conversion $p_{c}$ given qualitatively by\n$$\np_{c} = \\frac{1}{\\langle f \\rangle - 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + x}  1 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad x>0.\n$$\nThus even a small amount of trifunctional monomer is sufficient, at typical extents of reaction, to generate an infinite, covalently cross-linked siloxane network, which manifests macroscopically as a rigid gel rather than a flowable liquid.
