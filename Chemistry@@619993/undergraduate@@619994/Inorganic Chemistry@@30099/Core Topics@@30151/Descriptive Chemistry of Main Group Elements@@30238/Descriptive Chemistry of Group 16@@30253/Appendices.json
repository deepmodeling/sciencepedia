Bent", "solution": "To determine the molecular geometry of the sulfite ion, $SO_3^{2-}$, using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of valence electrons.**\nThe central atom is sulfur (S), and the surrounding atoms are oxygen (O).\n- Sulfur is in Group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\n- Oxygen is also in Group 16, so each of the three oxygen atoms has 6 valence electrons, for a total of $3 \\times 6 = 18$ electrons.\n- The ion has a charge of $2-$, which means we must add 2 more electrons to the total count.\n- Total valence electrons = (electrons from S) + (electrons from 3 O's) + (charge)\n- Total valence electrons = $6 + 18 + 2 = 26$ electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Draw the Lewis structure.**\n1.  Place the least electronegative atom, sulfur, at the center and arrange the three oxygen atoms around it.\n2.  Draw single bonds from the central sulfur atom to each of the three oxygen atoms. This uses $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons.\n3.  Calculate the remaining electrons: $26 - 6 = 20$ electrons.\n4.  Distribute these remaining electrons as lone pairs to the terminal oxygen atoms to satisfy their octets. Each oxygen atom needs 6 more electrons (3 lone pairs). Distributing $3 \\times 6 = 18$ electrons to the three oxygen atoms fulfills their octets.\n5.  Calculate the remaining electrons: $20 - 18 = 2$ electrons.\n6.  Place the final 2 electrons on the central sulfur atom as a lone pair.\n\nAt this point, the Lewis structure shows sulfur single-bonded to three oxygen atoms, with one lone pair on the sulfur. Each oxygen has three lone pairs. Let's check the formal charges, which confirms this is a major resonance contributor:\n- Formal Charge of Oxygen (single bond) = $6 - (6 + 1) = -1$\n- Formal Charge of Sulfur = $6 - (2 + 3) = +1$\nThe sum of formal charges is $3 \\times (-1) + 1 = -2$, which matches the ion's charge.\n(Note: Other resonance structures involving S=O double bonds can be drawn, but for VSEPR purposes, both single and double bonds count as a single electron domain, so the conclusion remains the same.)\n\n**Step 3: Apply the VSEPR model.**\n1.  Count the number of electron domains around the central atom, sulfur. An electron domain is either a bond (single, double, or triple) or a lone pair.\n    - There are 3 bonding domains (the three S-O bonds).\n    - There is 1 lone pair domain on the sulfur atom.\n    - Total number of electron domains = $3 + 1 = 4$.\n\n2.  Determine the electron geometry. The arrangement that minimizes repulsion for 4 electron domains is **tetrahedral**.\n\n3.  Determine the molecular geometry. The molecular geometry describes the arrangement of only the atoms, not the lone pairs. For a system with 4 total electron domains, consisting of 3 bonding pairs and 1 lone pair (designated as an $AX_3E_1$ system), the lone pair occupies one of the vertices of the tetrahedron, pushing the three bonding pairs closer together. This results in a **trigonal pyramidal** shape.\n\n**Step 4: Match the prediction to the given options.**\nThe predicted molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal, which corresponds to option C.\n- A. Trigonal planar corresponds to an AX3 system (3 bonding domains, 0 lone pairs).\n- B. T-shaped corresponds to an AX3E2 system (3 bonding domains, 2 lone pairs).\n- D. Tetrahedral is the *electron* geometry, not the molecular geometry, for an AX4 system. The molecular geometry is only tetrahedral if all four domains are bonding pairs (AX4).\n- E.

The prefix “peroxy” indicates the presence of an $O-O$ single bond. A Lewis structure consistent with formal charge minimization for third-period sulfur places, around each sulfur, two $S=O$ double bonds, one $S-O$ single bond to a hydroxyl group, and one $S-O$ single bond to an oxygen that participates in a central $O-O$ single bond linking the two sulfur centers. Symbolically, the skeleton is $HO-S(=O)_2-O-O-S(=O)_2-OH$. For sulfur (third period), using an expanded valence to form two $S=O$ double bonds minimizes formal charges: each sulfur has zero formal charge, each $=O$ oxygen has zero formal charge, each hydroxyl oxygen has zero formal charge when bonded to hydrogen, and each peroxo oxygen (single-bonded to sulfur and to the other oxygen) also has zero formal charge.\n\nNext, we determine the oxidation state of sulfur by applying oxidation state rules while correctly treating the peroxide linkage. Let the oxidation state of each sulfur be $x$. The molecule is neutral, so the sum of oxidation states is zero. Hydrogen in covalent compounds is $+1$; oxygen is $-2$ except in peroxides, where oxygen is $-1$. In $H_2S_2O_8$ there are:\n- $2$ hydrogens at $+1$ each, contributing $+2$,\n- $2$ oxygens in the $O-O$ bond at $-1$ each, contributing $-2$,\n- $6$ remaining oxygens at $-2$ each, contributing $-12$,\n- $2$ sulfurs at $x$ each, contributing $2x$.\n\nImposing charge balance gives\n$$2x + (+2) + (-2) + (-12) = 0,$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$2x - 12 = 0 \\implies 2x = 12 \\implies x = +6.$$\n\nTherefore, each sulfur has oxidation state $+6$, and the key structural feature is one peroxide ($O-O$) single bond linking the two sulfur-containing fragments.
