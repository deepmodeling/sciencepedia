Thus there are three bonding domains and one lone pair, for a steric number of $4$ at sulfur.\n- VSEPR with steric number $4$ and $1$ lone pair gives a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry (electron-domain geometry is tetrahedral, but one vertex is a lone pair).\n- Lone pair–bond pair repulsions are greater than bond pair–bond pair repulsions, so the O–S–O bond angles are compressed relative to the ideal tetrahedral angle, making them less than $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, $SO_{3}$ is trigonal planar, and the O–S–O bond angle in $SO_{3}^{2-}$ is less than $109.5^\\circ$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2290681"}, {"introduction": "Knowing a molecule's shape is the first step; predicting its reactions is the next. The thiosulfate ion, $S_2O_3^{2-}$, presents a fascinating case of ambidentate reactivity, where it uses different atoms to react depending on the attacking electrophile.

When treated with a strong acid, it is rapidly protonated. This protonation step initiates a decomposition reaction yielding elemental sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and water. In contrast, when thiosulfate is treated with a mild oxidizing agent such as aqueous iodine ($I_2$), it undergoes a clean oxidation to form the tetrathionate ion, $S_4O_6^{2-}$. Experimental evidence indicates that the initial site of electrophilic attack by a proton ($H^+$) is one of the terminal oxygen atoms, whereas the initial attack by the electrophilic iodine molecule occurs at the terminal sulfur atom.\n\nWhich of the following principles provides the most robust and complete explanation for this observed difference in regioselectivity?\n\nA.

The thiosulfate ion has terminal oxygen atoms that are highly electronegative, compact, and weakly polarizable; these behave as hard bases. The terminal sulfur atom is less electronegative and much more polarizable; it behaves as a soft base. The proton $H^{+}$ is the prototypical hard acid: very small, with high charge density and negligible polarizability, and its interactions are dominated by electrostatics. Molecular iodine $I_{2}$ functions as an electrophile via polarization of the I–I bond upon approach to a nucleophile, creating $I^{+}$-like character at one iodine; $I_{2}$ and such $\\text{I}^{+}$ character are highly polarizable and are categorized as soft acids.\n\nHard and Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) theory states that hard acids preferentially bind to hard bases and soft acids to soft bases, optimizing stabilization through matching polarizability and charge density. Applying HSAB:\n- $H^{+}$ (hard acid) will preferentially interact with the hard-base sites, i.e., the terminal oxygen atoms, leading to initial protonation at oxygen. This protonation activates subsequent decomposition to sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and water, consistent with the observed pathway.\n- $I_{2}$ (soft electrophile) will preferentially interact with the soft-base site, i.e., the terminal sulfur atom, initiating the clean oxidation that couples two thiosulfate units through sulfur to form $S_{4}O_{6}^{2-}$.\n\nNext, rule out the alternative explanations:\n- VSEPR predicts local geometry but does not quantify site-specific reactivity toward different electrophiles; it cannot account for the opposite site preference of $H^{+}$ versus $I_{2}$.\n- Electronegativity alone would predict oxygen to be the preferred site for both electrophiles, contradicting the observed preference of $I_{2}$ for sulfur; it lacks the soft/hard distinction and polarizability considerations essential here.\n- Formal charge analysis on a single resonance structure is incomplete; $S_{2}O_{3}^{2-}$ has significant resonance delocalization, and nucleophilicity depends not only on charge but also on polarizability and orbital interactions, which HSAB captures.\n- Steric hindrance is not controlling: both oxygen and sulfur termini are comparably accessible, and the directionally opposite selectivity for $H^{+}$ and $I_{2}$ is electronic rather than steric in origin.\n\nTherefore, the most robust and complete explanation for the difference in regioselectivity is provided by HSAB theory, matching hard $H^{+}$ with oxygen and soft $I_{2}$ with sulfur.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2290723"}, {"introduction": "The rich redox chemistry of sulfur means that many of its compounds can act as both oxidizing and reducing agents.
