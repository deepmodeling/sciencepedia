For a given borane with the general formula $B_p H_q$, its structure can be described by a four-digit integer, conventionally written as $(s, t, y, x)$. Each letter in this notation corresponds to a specific count of bonding elements within the molecule:\n- $s$ represents the number of three-center, two-electron B-H-B bonds (hydrogen bridges).\n- $t$ represents the number of three-center, two-electron B-B-B bonds (closed triangular arrangements of boron atoms).\n- $y$ represents the number of two-center, two-electron B-B bonds (conventional single bonds between boron atoms).\n- $x$ represents the number of boron atoms that are part of a $BH_2$ group.\n\nA specific borane, tetraborane(10), has the chemical formula $B_4H_{10}$.

Since each bridging hydrogen is counted in $s$, one has\n$$\nq=h_{t}+s.\n$$\nWith $q=10$ and $s=4$, this gives $h_{t}=10-4=6$. The $x=2$ $BH_{2}$ groups contribute $2x=4$ terminal hydrogens, leaving $6-4=2$ terminal hydrogens on the remaining two boron atoms, consistent with the known structure.
