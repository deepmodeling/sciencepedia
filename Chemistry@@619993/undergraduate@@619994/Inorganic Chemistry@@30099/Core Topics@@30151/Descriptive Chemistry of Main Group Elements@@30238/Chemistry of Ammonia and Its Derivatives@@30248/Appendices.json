A primary amine has one carbon substituent and two hydrogens on nitrogen, a secondary amine has two carbon substituents and one hydrogen on nitrogen, and a tertiary amine has three carbon substituents and no N–H bonds. The requirement specifies a tertiary amine, which must therefore have the nitrogen bonded to three carbon groups and no hydrogen.\n\nExamine each option:\nA. Aniline has the structure $C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}$, which features one aryl group and two hydrogens on nitrogen, so it is a primary amine.\nB. Cyclohexylamine has the structure $C_{6}H_{11}NH_{2}$, which features one alkyl group and two hydrogens on nitrogen, so it is a primary amine.\nC. N-ethylaniline has the structure $C_{6}H_{5}NHCH_{2}CH_{3}$, which features two carbon substituents and one hydrogen on nitrogen, so it is a secondary amine.\nD. N,N-dimethylaniline has the structure $C_{6}H_{5}N(CH_{3})_{2}$, which features three carbon substituents (one aryl and two methyl groups) and no N–H bonds, so it is a tertiary amine.\nE. tert-Butylamine has the structure $(CH_{3})_{3}CNH_{2}$, which features one alkyl group and two hydrogens on nitrogen, so it is a primary amine.\n\nTherefore, the only tertiary amine among the choices is N,N-dimethylaniline, corresponding to option D, which also aligns with the need for a sterically hindered, relatively non-nucleophilic tertiary base due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair into the aryl ring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2238492"}, {"introduction": "One of the most important properties of ammonia and its derivatives is their basicity.
