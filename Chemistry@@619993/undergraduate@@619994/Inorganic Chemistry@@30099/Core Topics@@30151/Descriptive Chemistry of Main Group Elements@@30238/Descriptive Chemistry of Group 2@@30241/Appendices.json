The substance is being considered for use in neutralizing acidic industrial effluent. To determine its chemical identity, the chemist performs a series of qualitative tests.\n\nThe observations are as follows:\n1. The powder is sparingly soluble in water, forming an aqueous solution that is basic.\n2. When a small amount of the powder is introduced into a Bunsen burner flame using a clean platinum wire, the flame turns a persistent brick-red color.\n3. When carbon dioxide gas is slowly bubbled through a clear, saturated aqueous solution of the substance, a milky white precipitate is formed.\n\nBased on these observations, what is the most plausible chemical formula for this substance?\n\nA. $\\text{Mg(OH)}_2$\n\nB. $\\text{Ca(OH)}_2$\n\nC. $\\text{SrO}$\n\nD. $\\text{BaCl}_2$\n\nE. $\\text{CaCO}_3$", "solution": "We analyze each observation using established qualitative inorganic analysis principles.\n\nFirst, the flame test: a persistent brick-red color is characteristic of the calcium ion. The underlying principle is that thermal excitation of metal ions produces emission at characteristic wavelengths; calcium gives a brick-red emission, whereas strontium gives crimson, barium gives apple green, sodium gives yellow, and magnesium effectively gives no color. Therefore, the cation is most plausibly $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. This immediately favors calcium-containing options and excludes $\\text{Mg(OH)}_2$ and $\\text{BaCl}_2$ based on the flame colors of $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ (no color) and $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ (green), and also excludes $\\text{SrO}$ (crimson for $\\text{Sr}^{2+}$).\n\nSecond, the substance is sparingly soluble in water and forms a basic solution. A sparingly soluble calcium hydroxide dissolves according to\n$$\n\\text{Ca(OH)}_2\\text{(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ca}^{2+}\\text{(aq)} + 2\\,\\text{OH}^-\\text{(aq)},\n$$\nproducing a basic solution due to the presence of $\\text{OH}^-$. Its low solubility is captured by a small solubility product $K_{sp}$, without requiring any numerical substitution. Calcium carbonate dissolves as\n$$\n\\text{CaCO}_3\\text{(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ca}^{2+}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{CO}_3^{2-}\\text{(aq)},\n$$\nand $\\text{CO}_3^{2-}$ hydrolyzes water to generate some $\\text{OH}^-$, so a saturated solution can be slightly basic. However, the decisive discrimination comes from the carbon dioxide test.\n\nThird, when $\\text{CO}_2$ is bubbled through a clear, saturated aqueous solution of the substance, a milky white precipitate forms. For a saturated solution of $\\text{Ca(OH)}_2$ (limewater), the mechanistic steps are\n$$\n\\text{CO}_2\\text{(aq)} + \\text{OH}^-\\text{(aq)} \\to \\text{HCO}_3^-\\text{(aq)},\n$$\n$$\n\\text{HCO}_3^-\\text{(aq)} + \\text{OH}^-\\text{(aq)} \\to \\text{CO}_3^{2-}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O(l)},\n$$\nso that overall\n$$\n\\text{CO}_2\\text{(aq)} + 2\\,\\text{OH}^-\\text{(aq)} \\to \\text{CO}_3^{2-}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O(l)}.\n$$\nIn the presence of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ from dissolved $\\text{Ca(OH)}_2$, this yields the insoluble carbonate:\n$$\n\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{CO}_3^{2-}\\text{(aq)} \\to \\text{CaCO}_3\\text{(s)},\n$$\ngiving the characteristic milky white precipitate. The net reaction in limewater is\n$$\n\\text{Ca(OH)}_2\\text{(aq)} + \\text{CO}_2\\text{(g)} \\to \\text{CaCO}_3\\text{(s)} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O(l)}.\n$$\nThis is the classical limewater test for carbon dioxide.\n\nBy contrast, if the original solid were $\\text{CaCO}_3$, bubbling $\\text{CO}_2$ through its saturated solution would shift equilibria toward bicarbonate and increase solubility rather than produce a precipitate:\n$$\n\\text{CaCO}_3\\text{(s)} + \\text{CO}_2\\text{(aq)} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O(l)} \\to \\text{Ca(HCO}_3)_2\\text{(aq)}.\n$$\nThus a milky precipitate upon introducing $\\text{CO}_2$ into the saturated solution uniquely supports $\\text{Ca(OH)}_2$ over $\\text{CaCO}_3$.\n\nCombining all observations—brick-red flame (calcium), sparing solubility with a basic solution, and the limewater test yielding a milky $\\text{CaCO}_3$ precipitate—the most plausible identity is calcium hydroxide.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2246939"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identification, we must also be able to quantify chemical reactions.
