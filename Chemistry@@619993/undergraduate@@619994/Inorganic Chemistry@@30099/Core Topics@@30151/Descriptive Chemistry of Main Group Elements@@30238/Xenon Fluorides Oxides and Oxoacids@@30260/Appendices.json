To determine these properties, we will first construct the Lewis structure and then apply the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of valence electrons.**\nXenon (Xe) is in Group 18, so it has 8 valence electrons.\nOxygen (O) is in Group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\nFluorine (F) is in Group 17, and there are four F atoms, so they contribute $4 \\times 7 = 28$ valence electrons.\nTotal valence electrons = $8 (\\text{from Xe}) + 6 (\\text{from O}) + 28 (\\text{from 4 F}) = 42$ valence electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Draw the skeletal structure and the Lewis structure.**\nXenon is the least electronegative atom (other than being a noble gas), so it will be the central atom. The four fluorine atoms and one oxygen atom are bonded to the central xenon atom.\n\nInitially, we can draw five single bonds from Xe to the surrounding atoms. This uses $5 \\times 2 = 10$ electrons. We then distribute the remaining $42 - 10 = 32$ electrons as lone pairs to the terminal atoms to satisfy their octets. Each of the four F atoms needs 6 electrons, and the O atom needs 6 electrons, for a total of $4 \\times 6 + 6 = 30$ electrons.\n\nAfter placing 30 electrons on the terminal atoms, we have $32 - 30 = 2$ electrons remaining. These are placed on the central Xe atom as a lone pair.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the formal charges (FC) for this structure (with all single bonds):\nFC = (Valence electrons) - (Lone pair electrons) - (1/2 * Bonding electrons)\nFC(F) = $7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\nFC(O) = $6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$\nFC(Xe) = $8 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(10) = +1$\n\nTo minimize the formal charges, we can convert a lone pair from the oxygen atom into a bonding pair, forming a double bond between Xe and O. The new Lewis structure has Xe singly bonded to four F atoms, doubly bonded to the O atom, and with one lone pair.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the formal charges for this new structure:\nFC(F) = $7 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 0$\nFC(O) = $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\nFC(Xe) = $8 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(12) = 0$\nThis structure has zero formal charge on all atoms and is the most stable and preferred Lewis structure. In this structure, the central Xe atom has 4 single bonds, 1 double bond, and 1 lone pair.\n\n**Step 3: Apply VSEPR theory to determine the geometry.**\nWe count the number of electron domains around the central Xe atom. A single bond, double bond, triple bond, or lone pair each counts as one electron domain.\nNumber of electron domains on Xe = (4 single bonds to F) + (1 double bond to O) + (1 lone pair) = 6 electron domains.\n\nThe electron geometry for 6 electron domains (steric number 6) is **octahedral**.\n\nThe molecular geometry is determined by the arrangement of the bonding domains only. We have 5 bonding domains and 1 lone pair (an $AX_5E_1$ type). According to VSEPR theory, this arrangement corresponds to a **square pyramidal** molecular geometry. The lone pair occupies one of the axial positions of the octahedron to minimize electron-electron repulsion, and the five atoms form a pyramid with a square base. The four fluorine atoms form the base, and the oxygen atom occupies the apical position.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the polarity of the molecule.**\nPolarity is determined by the presence of a net molecular dipole moment, which arises from the vector sum of all individual bond dipoles.\nThe Xe-F and Xe=O bonds are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between the atoms (F and O are highly electronegative).\n\nIn the square pyramidal geometry of $XeOF_4$:\n- The four Xe-F bond dipoles are arranged in the square base. Although they point outwards from the center, the Xe atom is not in the plane of the F atoms. Therefore, the vector sum of these four dipoles is not zero; it results in a net dipole vector pointing along the principal axis, away from the F-plane and towards the lone pair.\n- The Xe=O bond is also polar, with its dipole moment pointing along the principal axis towards the oxygen atom.\n- The lone pair on Xe also contributes to the molecular dipole, creating an effective dipole moment pointing away from the nucleus, in the direction of the lone pair.\n\nThe overall molecular dipole is the vector sum of the dipoles from the Xe-F bonds, the Xe=O bond, and the lone pair. All these components have a resultant along the main rotational axis (the axis passing through the O, Xe, and the lone pair). Since the magnitude of the dipole moment from the lone pair side and the bonding side are not identical, they cannot cancel each other out. The molecule is asymmetrical and therefore possesses a net dipole moment. Thus, the molecule is **polar**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe molecular geometry of $XeOF_4$ is square pyramidal, and the molecule is polar.

A branching chain reaction is one in which the number of reactive chain carriers increases during the propagation steps. Let's analyze each proposed mechanism. The primary chain carrier in most of these options is atomic oxygen ($\\text{O}$).\n\n**Analysis of Mechanism A:**\nThis mechanism proposes the formation of a dimer, $\\text{Xe}_2\\text{O}_6$, which then decomposes.\n- Initiation: $2 \\text{XeO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{Xe}_2\\text{O}_6$\n- Propagation: $\\text{Xe}_2\\text{O}_6 \\rightarrow 2 \\text{XeO} + 2 \\text{O}_2(g)$\nIn this sequence, the product of the propagation step, $\\text{XeO}$, does not react with the initial reactant, $\\text{XeO}_3$, to continue a cycle. It simply decomposes in the termination step. There is no feedback loop where a product catalyzes the reaction of the starting material. Therefore, this mechanism is not autocatalytic and cannot explain the explosive acceleration.\n\n**Analysis of Mechanism B:**\nThis mechanism proposes a radical chain reaction with atomic oxygen ($\\text{O}$) as the chain carrier. Let's trace the number of carriers through the propagation cycle.\n- Propagation I: $\\text{O} + \\text{XeO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{XeO}_2 + \\text{O}_2(g)$\n- Propagation II: $\\text{XeO}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{XeO} + \\text{O}$\nIn this cycle, one chain carrier ($\\text{O}$) is consumed in step I. The intermediate $\\text{XeO}_2$ then decomposes in step II to regenerate exactly one chain carrier ($\\text{O}$). Since the number of carriers remains constant (one in, one out), this is a **linear chain reaction**. A linear chain reaction can sustain a reaction at a steady rate after initiation, but it does not lead to the exponential rate increase characteristic of an explosion. Thus, this mechanism is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Mechanism C:**\nThis mechanism suggests that Xenon gas ($\\text{Xe}(g)$) acts as an autocatalyst.\n- Autocatalysis: $\\text{XeO}_3 + \\text{Xe}(g) \\rightarrow \\text{XeO} + \\text{Xe}(g) + \\text{O}_2(g)$\nWhile $\\text{Xe}(g)$ appears on both sides of the equation, suggesting a catalytic role, this is chemically implausible. Xenon is a noble gas with an extremely high ionization energy and low reactivity. It is highly unlikely to react with $\\text{XeO}_3$ under these conditions to facilitate its decomposition. This mechanism relies on an chemically unfeasible catalytic step.\n\n**Analysis of Mechanism D:**\nThis mechanism proposes a radical chain reaction with atomic oxygen ($\\text{O}(g)$) as the carrier. Let's analyze the propagation cycle for branching.\n- Propagation I (Consumption): $\\text{O}(g) + \\text{XeO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{XeO}_2 + \\text{O}_2(g)$\n- Propagation II (Branching): $\\text{XeO}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{Xe}(g) + 2 \\text{O}(g)$\nLet's follow a single chain carrier, an $\\text{O}$ atom. In step I, one $\\text{O}$ atom is consumed, but it produces a molecule of $\\text{XeO}_2$. In step II, this single molecule of $\\text{XeO}_2$ decomposes to produce **two** new $\\text{O}$ atoms.\nThe net result of one full cycle (one $\\text{O}$ atom proceeding through step I, and the resulting $\\text{XeO}_2$ proceeding through step II) is the consumption of one $\\text{O}$ atom and the production of two $\\text{O}$ atoms. This is a net gain of one chain carrier per cycle. The number of reactive intermediates doubles in each effective cycle ($1 \\rightarrow 2$). This is the definition of a **branching chain reaction**. The exponential increase in the concentration of the chain carrier ($\\text{O}(g)$) leads to an exponential acceleration of the overall reaction rate, which correctly models autocatalysis and detonation. Furthermore, the combination of the propagation and termination steps yields the correct overall stoichiometry: The net propagation cycle is $\\text{XeO}_3 + \\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{Xe} + \\text{O}_2 + 2\\text{O}$, simplifying to $\\text{XeO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{Xe} + \\text{O}_2 + \\text{O}$. If two such cycles occur, we produce $2\\text{Xe} + 2\\text{O}_2 + 2\\text{O}$. The termination step $2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{O}_2$ consumes these two oxygen atoms, leading to the final products $2\\text{Xe} + 3\\text{O}_2$ from two $\\text{XeO}_3$ molecules. This mechanism is chemically plausible and correctly describes the observed explosive behavior.\n\n**Analysis of Mechanism E:**\nThis mechanism also involves atomic oxygen ($\\text{O}(g)$).\n- Initiation: $\\text{XeO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{Xe}(g) + 3 \\text{O}(g)$\n- Propagation: $\\text{O}(g) + \\text{XeO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{Xe}(g) + 2 \\text{O}_2(g)$\nThe proposed \"propagation\" step consumes one chain carrier ($\\text{O}(g)$) but produces no new chain carriers. This is, in fact, a chain termination step. A reaction cannot propagate, let alone branch, if its propagation step consumes the only reactive species. The reaction would cease immediately after the initial burst of $\\text{O}$ atoms from the high-energy initiation step is consumed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMechanism D is the only one that presents a chemically plausible, branching chain reaction, which is the required feature to explain the autocatalytic explosion of $\\text{XeO}_3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2299606"}]}
