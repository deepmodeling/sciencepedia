The cation has a trigonal planar electron geometry, leading to a bond angle of approximately $120^\\circ$, while the anion has a tetrahedral electron geometry with an angle less than $109.5^\\circ$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must apply the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory to predict the molecular geometries and bond angles of the cation $ClF_2^+$ and the anion $ClF_2^-$. The central atom in both species is chlorine (Cl).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the cation $ClF_2^+$**\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of valence electrons for $ClF_2^+$.\nTotal valence electrons = $7 (\\text{from Cl}) + 2 \\times 7 (\\text{from F}) - 1 (\\text{charge}) = 7 + 14 - 1 = 20$ valence electrons.\n\nNext, we draw the Lewis structure. Chlorine is the central atom, bonded to two fluorine atoms.\n- A single bond between Cl and each F uses $2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons.\n- We have $20 - 4 = 16$ electrons remaining to be distributed as lone pairs.\n- To satisfy the octet rule for the terminal fluorine atoms, we place 3 lone pairs (6 electrons) on each F. This uses $2 \\times 6 = 12$ electrons.\n- We have $16 - 12 = 4$ electrons remaining. These are placed on the central chlorine atom as 2 lone pairs.\n\nThe central chlorine atom in $ClF_2^+$ has 2 bonding pairs (to the F atoms) and 2 lone pairs. This gives a total of 4 electron domains.\n\nAccording to VSEPR theory, 4 electron domains arrange themselves in a **tetrahedral** electron geometry to minimize repulsion. The ideal angle in a perfect tetrahedron is $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nThe molecular geometry is determined by the positions of the atoms only. With 2 bonding pairs and 2 lone pairs, the shape is **bent** or **V-shaped**. The lone pairs exert a stronger repulsive force than bonding pairs ($LP-LP > LP-BP > BP-BP$). These repulsions push the two Cl-F bonds closer together. Therefore, the F-Cl-F bond angle in $ClF_2^+$ will be significantly **less than $109.5^\\circ$**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the anion $ClF_2^-$**\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of valence electrons for $ClF_2^-$.\nTotal valence electrons = $7 (\\text{from Cl}) + 2 \\times 7 (\\text{from F}) + 1 (\\text{charge}) = 7 + 14 + 1 = 22$ valence electrons.\n\nNext, we draw the Lewis structure. Chlorine is the central atom, bonded to two fluorine atoms.\n- A single bond between Cl and each F uses $2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons.\n- We have $22 - 4 = 18$ electrons remaining to be distributed as lone pairs.\n- To satisfy the octet rule for the terminal fluorine atoms, we place 3 lone pairs (6 electrons) on each F. This uses $2 \\times 6 = 12$ electrons.\n- We have $18 - 12 = 6$ electrons remaining. These are placed on the central chlorine atom as 3 lone pairs.\n\nThe central chlorine atom in $ClF_2^-$ has 2 bonding pairs and 3 lone pairs. This gives a total of 5 electron domains.\n\nAccording to VSEPR theory, 5 electron domains arrange themselves in a **trigonal bipyramidal** electron geometry. In this arrangement, to minimize repulsion, the lone pairs occupy the positions with more space, which are the three equatorial positions. The bonding pairs are forced into the remaining two axial positions.\n\nThe molecular geometry is determined by the positions of the atoms. With the two fluorine atoms in the axial positions and the central chlorine atom between them, the molecular geometry is **linear**. The F-Cl-F bond angle is therefore **$180^\\circ$**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the bond angles and evaluate the options.**\n\n- The F-Cl-F bond angle in $ClF_2^+$ is less than $109.5^\\circ$.\n- The F-Cl-F bond angle in $ClF_2^-$ is $180^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the bond angle in $ClF_2^-$ is significantly larger than the bond angle in $ClF_2^+$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n- A is incorrect. The angle in $ClF_2^+$ is smaller.\n- B is incorrect. The angles are very different (less than $109.5^\\circ$ vs. $180^\\circ$).\n- C is correct. It correctly states that the angle in $ClF_2^-$ is larger and provides the correct VSEPR-based reasoning for the geometries of both ions (linear from trigonal bipyramidal for $ClF_2^-$ and bent from tetrahedral for $ClF_2^+$).\n- D is incorrect. While the angle in $ClF_2^-$ is larger, the reasoning provided (\"negative charge causes more repulsion\") is an oversimplification and not the precise VSEPR explanation. The key is the number of electron domains and their specific arrangement.\n- E is incorrect. It misidentifies the electron geometry of $ClF_2^+$ as trigonal planar and gets the comparison backward.\n\nThe correct statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2261689"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond basic shape prediction, a deeper understanding of molecular structure involves analyzing the subtle differences in bond lengths and angles within a single molecule. The interhalogen compound chlorine trifluoride ($ClF_3$) serves as a classic case study for this more advanced application of VSEPR theory. This practice [@problem_id:2261744] challenges you to explain why the bonds in its T-shaped geometry are not all identical, a key insight rooted in the differing magnitudes of repulsion between bonding pairs and lone pairs.", "problem": "Chlorine trifluoride ($ClF_3$) is a potent fluorinating agent and an interesting example of an interhalogen compound. Its molecular structure is a key determinant of its reactivity. Based on the principles of the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, a chemist proposes several hypotheses regarding the geometry and bond lengths of the $ClF_3$ molecule. Analyze the electronic structure of the central chlorine atom and evaluate the following statements. Which one provides the most accurate description?\n\nA. The molecule adopts a T-shaped geometry. The two axial Cl-F bonds are longer than the single equatorial Cl-F bond because the axial bonding pairs experience greater repulsion from the two equatorial lone pairs.\nB. The molecule adopts a T-shaped geometry. To minimize repulsions, the two lone pairs occupy the axial positions, leading to a structure where the three Cl-F bonds are identical in length.\nC. The molecule adopts a trigonal planar geometry since it has three fluorine atoms bonded to the central chlorine atom. Consequently, all three Cl-F bonds are identical in length.\nD. The molecule adopts a T-shaped geometry. The equatorial Cl-F bond is longer than the two axial Cl-F bonds because the repulsion experienced by the equatorial bonding pair from the two equatorial lone pairs is the dominant interaction.", "solution": "First, determine the electron-domain arrangement around the central chlorine. Chlorine has seven valence electrons. In $ClF_3$, chlorine forms three Cl-F bonds, using three bonding pairs, and retains two lone pairs. Therefore, the central atom has 5 electron domains in total, which corresponds in VSEPR to an $AX_3E_2$ species.\n\nFor 5 electron domains, the electron-domain geometry is trigonal bipyramidal. VSEPR dictates that lone pairs prefer equatorial positions in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement to minimize repulsions, because an equatorial lone pair has two $90^{\\circ}$ interactions (with the two axial positions) and two $120^{\\circ}$ interactions (with the other equatorial positions), whereas an axial lone pair would have three $90^{\\circ}$ interactions with the equatorial positions. Since $90^{\\circ}$ interactions are more destabilizing than $120^{\\circ}$ interactions, placing lone pairs equatorial minimizes repulsion.\n\nWith two lone pairs occupying two equatorial sites, the three fluorine atoms occupy two axial positions and one equatorial position, yielding a T-shaped molecular geometry.\n\nNext, compare repulsions experienced by axial and equatorial Cl-F bonding pairs to rationalize bond lengths. Use the standard VSEPR repulsion hierarchy $LP-LP > LP-BP > BP-BP$ and the fact that $90^{\\circ}$ interactions are more repulsive than $120^{\\circ}$ interactions.\n\n- Each axial Cl-F bond has three $90^{\\circ}$ interactions with the equatorial plane: two $LP-BP$ interactions (with the two equatorial lone pairs) and one $BP-BP$ interaction (with the equatorial Cl-F bond).\n- The equatorial Cl-F bond has two $90^{\\circ}$ $BP-BP$ interactions (with the two axial bonds) and two $120^{\\circ}$ $LP-BP$ interactions (with the two equatorial lone pairs).\n\nBecause $LP-BP$ repulsions are stronger than $BP-BP$ and because $90^{\\circ}$ interactions are stronger than $120^{\\circ}$ interactions, the axial bonds experience greater net repulsion (notably two $90^{\\circ}$ $LP-BP$ interactions) than the equatorial bond. Greater repulsion weakens and lengthens bonds. Hence, the axial Cl-F bonds are longer than the equatorial Cl-F bond.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: Correct. Geometry is T-shaped, and axial bonds are longer due to greater $90^{\\circ}$ $LP-BP$ repulsion from the two equatorial lone pairs.\n- B: Incorrect. Lone pairs do not occupy axial positions; they occupy equatorial positions in trigonal bipyramidal arrangements.\n- C: Incorrect. The electron-domain geometry is trigonal bipyramidal, not trigonal planar; the molecular geometry is T-shaped.\n- D: Incorrect. It predicts the opposite bond-length trend; the dominant repulsions lengthen the axial, not the equatorial, bond.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2261744"}, {"introduction": "The chemistry of interhalogen compounds extends beyond their static structures to their dynamic reactivity.
