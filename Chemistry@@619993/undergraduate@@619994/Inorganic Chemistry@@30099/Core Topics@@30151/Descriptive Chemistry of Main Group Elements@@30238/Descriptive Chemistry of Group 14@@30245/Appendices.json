{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The chemistry of Group 14 elements is a story of dramatic contrasts, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the reactivity of carbon and silicon. This practice explores a classic chemical puzzle: why is silicon tetrachloride ($\\text{SiCl}_4$) violently reactive with water, while its carbon analogue, carbon tetrachloride ($\\text{CCl}_4$), is practically inert? Solving this requires moving beyond simple arguments of bond strength and delving into the underlying reaction mechanism, highlighting the crucial role that atomic structure and the availability of valence orbitals play in dictating chemical pathways [@problem_id:2245505].", "problem": "Carbon tetrachloride ($\\text{CCl}_4$) is a dense, non-polar liquid that is exceptionally stable and resistant to hydrolysis. It can be stored in contact with water for extended periods without significant reaction. In dramatic contrast, silicon tetrachloride ($\\text{SiCl}_4$), the silicon analogue of $\\text{CCl}_4$, reacts violently and exothermically upon contact with water, producing silicic acid and hydrogen chloride gas.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental chemical reason for this stark difference in reactivity towards water?\n\nA. The C-Cl bond is exceptionally strong, making the initial bond-breaking step required for hydrolysis energetically prohibitive for $\\text{CCl}_4$.\n\nB. The four chlorine atoms create a much greater degree of steric hindrance around the small central carbon atom compared to the larger silicon atom, physically preventing the approach of a nucleophilic water molecule.\n\nC. Carbon is more electronegative than silicon. This results in the C-Cl bonds being less polar than the Si-Cl bonds, which significantly reduces the partial positive charge on the carbon atom in $\\text{CCl}_4$ and makes it a much less attractive target for nucleophilic attack by water.\n\nD. As a third-period element, silicon has accessible, low-energy vacant 3d-orbitals which can accept a lone pair of electrons from a water molecule to form a five-coordinate intermediate, providing a low-energy pathway for the reaction. Carbon, a second-period element, lacks such available orbitals.", "solution": "The problem asks for the primary reason behind the differing reactivity of carbon tetrachloride ($\\text{CCl}_4$) and silicon tetrachloride ($\\text{SiCl}_4$) towards hydrolysis by water. The reaction involves a water molecule, acting as a nucleophile, attacking the central atom (carbon or silicon). The key is to analyze the availability of a viable reaction pathway for this nucleophilic attack.\n\nLet's analyze the proposed options:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction mechanism.**\nHydrolysis of a halide like $\\text{SiCl}_4$ proceeds via a nucleophilic substitution mechanism. The oxygen atom in the water molecule possesses lone pairs of electrons and acts as a nucleophile. The central silicon atom is bonded to four electronegative chlorine atoms, making it electron-deficient (electrophilic) and susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\nFor $\\text{SiCl}_4$: The silicon atom is in the third period of the periodic table. Its electron configuration is [Ne] $3s^2 3p^2$. It has vacant, energetically accessible 3d orbitals. A water molecule can approach the silicon atom and donate a pair of electrons into one of these empty 3d orbitals. This forms a five-coordinate, trigonal bipyramidal intermediate, $[\\text{SiCl}_4(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})]$. This intermediate is unstable and rapidly eliminates a molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl), leading to the substitution of a chlorine atom with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This process repeats until all four chlorine atoms are replaced, ultimately forming silicic acid, $\\text{Si(OH)}_4$.\n\nFor $\\text{CCl}_4$: The carbon atom is a second-period element with the electron configuration [He] $2s^2 2p^2$. It has only 2s and 2p orbitals in its valence shell. There are no low-energy vacant d-orbitals (the 3d orbitals are too high in energy to be accessible). For water to attack the carbon atom, carbon would need to expand its octet to form a five-coordinate intermediate. Without accessible d-orbitals, this is not possible via a low-energy pathway. The reaction is therefore kinetically hindered to a very large extent, making $\\text{CCl}_4$ effectively inert to hydrolysis under normal conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the given options based on this mechanistic understanding.**\n\n**Option A:** This option suggests the difference is purely kinetic, based on bond-breaking. While the C-Cl bond is strong, thermodynamic calculations show that the overall hydrolysis reaction for $\\text{CCl}_4$ is actually thermodynamically favorable (exergonic). The issue is not that the reaction *can't* happen from an energy standpoint, but that it is kinetically extremely slow due to a very high activation energy for the available pathway. The strength of the C-Cl bond contributes to this, but the lack of a low-energy pathway (Option D) is the more fundamental reason.\n\n**Option B:** This option points to steric hindrance. The carbon atom is smaller than the silicon atom, so one might argue that the four chlorine atoms shield it more effectively. While steric effects do influence reaction rates, the primary barrier here is electronic, not steric. Even if a water molecule could approach the carbon atom, there is no low-energy orbital for it to interact with to initiate the reaction. The lack of a mechanistic pathway is a more fundamental barrier than physical crowding.\n\n**Option C:** This option focuses on electronegativity and bond polarity. The electronegativity values are approximately: C(2.55), Si(1.90), and Cl(3.16). The difference in electronegativity for Si-Cl is $|1.90 - 3.16| = 1.26$, while for C-Cl it is $|2.55 - 3.16| = 0.61$. This means the Si-Cl bond is indeed more polar, and the silicon atom carries a larger partial positive charge ($\\delta+$) than the carbon atom. This does make silicon a better electrophile and contributes to its higher reactivity. However, this is not the fundamental reason why $\\text{CCl}_4$ is *unreactive*. The carbon in $\\text{CCl}_4$ is still electrophilic enough to be attacked, but the *pathway* for that attack is missing. The ability to form an intermediate is the crucial difference between reactivity and non-reactivity, not just the degree of electrophilicity.\n\n**Option D:** This option correctly identifies the core mechanistic difference. Silicon's ability to utilize its vacant 3d orbitals to expand its coordination sphere and form a five-coordinate intermediate provides a low-energy pathway for the nucleophilic attack by water. Carbon lacks this capability because it is in the second period and has no accessible d-orbitals. This kinetic barrier is the fundamental reason why $\\text{SiCl}_4$ hydrolyzes readily while $\\text{CCl}_4$ is resistant.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most fundamental reason for the different behavior is the availability of a low-energy reaction pathway for silicon via the formation of a hypervalent intermediate, which is not possible for carbon. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2245505"}, {"introduction": "As we move down Group 14, the stability of the highest oxidation state ($+4$) decreases relative to the $+2$ state, a phenomenon known as the \"inert pair effect.\" This practice examines a direct consequence of this trend through the curious case of lead(IV) iodide ($\\text{PbI}_4$), a compound that cannot be isolated.

Any attempt to synthesize it results in its immediate decomposition.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best chemical explanation for the non-existence of lead(IV) iodide?\n\nA. The large ionic radius of the iodide anion ($\\text{I}^{-}$) relative to the lead(IV) cation ($\\text{Pb}^{4+}$) leads to significant steric hindrance, preventing the formation of a stable crystal lattice.\nB. $\\text{Pb}^{4+}$ is a strong oxidizing agent, while $\\text{I}^{-}$ is a sufficiently strong reducing agent, leading to an internal redox reaction where $\\text{Pb}^{4+}$ is reduced to $\\text{Pb}^{2+}$ and $\\text{I}^{-}$ is oxidized to $\\text{I}_2$.\nC.

For lead, the $+2$ oxidation state is thermodynamically more stable than $+4$ due to the inertness of the $6s^{2}$ electron pair. Consequently, $\\text{Pb}^{4+}$ is a strong oxidizing agent and tends to be reduced to $\\text{Pb}^{2+}$.\n\nKey principle 2: Reducing strength of iodide versus lighter halides. Iodide, $\\text{I}^{-}$, is a much stronger reducing agent than $\\text{F}^{-}$ or $\\text{Cl}^{-}$.
