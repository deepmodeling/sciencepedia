See-saw, $sp^3d$", "solution": "To determine the molecular geometry and hybridization of the tetrahydroaluminate anion, $[AlH_4]^-$, we apply the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory.\n\nStep 1: Identify the central atom.\nIn the $[AlH_4]^-$ anion, aluminum (Al) is the central atom, as it is the least electronegative element besides hydrogen.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of valence electrons for the central atom, including the ion's charge.\nAluminum is in Group 13 of the periodic table, so a neutral aluminum atom has 3 valence electrons. The anion has a charge of -1, which means there is one extra electron. For the purpose of determining the electron domains around the central atom, we can add this extra electron to the valence count of the aluminum atom.\nValence electrons on central atom for VSEPR = (Valence electrons of neutral Al) + (magnitude of negative charge)\nValence electrons on central atom for VSEPR = $3 + 1 = 4$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of electron domains around the central atom.\nThe central aluminum atom is bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Each bond represents an electron domain. We need to determine if there are any lone pairs on the central atom. The aluminum atom has 4 valence electrons (as calculated in Step 2) available for bonding. It forms single bonds with four hydrogen atoms, thus using all four of its available valence electrons to form four bonding pairs.\nNumber of bonding pairs = 4\nNumber of lone pairs = 0\nThe total number of electron domains, also known as the steric number, is the sum of bonding pairs and lone pairs.\nSteric Number = (Number of bonding pairs) + (Number of lone pairs) = $4 + 0 = 4$.\n\nStep 4: Determine the electron geometry and molecular geometry.\nAccording to VSEPR theory, a steric number of 4 corresponds to an electronic geometry where the electron domains are arranged tetrahedrally around the central atom to minimize repulsion. Since there are no lone pairs on the central aluminum atom (all four electron domains are bonding pairs), the molecular geometry is the same as the electron geometry.\nTherefore, the molecular geometry of $[AlH_4]^-$ is tetrahedral.\n\nStep 5: Determine the hybridization of the central atom.\nThe hybridization of the central atom is determined by its steric number. A steric number of 4 corresponds to the use of one s orbital and three p orbitals, leading to $sp^3$ hybridization. Thus, the aluminum atom in $[AlH_4]^-$ is $sp^3$ hybridized.\n\nStep 6: Match the findings with the given options.\nOur analysis concludes that the $[AlH_4]^-$ anion has a tetrahedral molecular geometry and the central aluminum atom has $sp^3$ hybridization.

This practice [@problem_id:2245196] challenges you to explain a classic structural dichotomy: why trimethylaluminum, $Al(CH_3)_3$, dimerizes while triisopropylaluminum, $Al(i\\text{-}C_3H_7)_3$, remains a monomer. By analyzing this case, you will explore the critical balance between the electronic drive to alleviate electron deficiency and the steric repulsion from bulky substituents, a key principle governing the structure and reactivity of organometallic compounds.", "problem": "Organoaluminum compounds are pivotal reagents in organic synthesis and industrial catalysis. Their structure and reactivity are a central theme in organometallic chemistry. Consider two common trialkylaluminum species: trimethylaluminum, $Al(CH_3)_3$, and triisopropylaluminum, $Al(i\\text{-}C_3H_7)_3$. Experimental studies reveal a stark difference in their structures in non-coordinating solvents. Trimethylaluminum exists predominantly as a stable dimer, $Al_2(CH_3)_6$, featuring two bridging methyl groups. In contrast, triisopropylaluminum overwhelmingly favors a monomeric structure, $Al(i\\text{-}C_3H_7)_3$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and comprehensive chemical rationale for this observed structural difference?\n\nA. The isopropyl group is more electron-withdrawing than the methyl group due to hyperconjugation. This reduces the electron density on the aluminum atom in triisopropylaluminum so significantly that it can no longer coordinate to another monomer unit.\n\nB. The aluminum atom in a monomeric $AlR_3$ unit is electron-deficient, possessing only six valence electrons, which drives dimerization to achieve a more stable electronic configuration. However, the large steric bulk of the isopropyl groups in triisopropylaluminum creates severe non-bonded repulsion, destabilizing the bridged dimer structure that is readily formed by the much smaller methyl groups.\n\nC. Both trimethylaluminum and triisopropylaluminum are nonpolar. The dimerization of trimethylaluminum is driven by strong intermolecular van der Waals forces between the methyl groups, which are much weaker for the bulkier and more branched isopropyl groups.\n\nD. The aluminum atom in $AlR_3$ compounds is hypervalent. Dimerization allows for the expansion of aluminum's coordination sphere to relieve this hypervalency. The methyl groups are small enough to permit this, while the larger isopropyl groups prevent it due to steric clash.\n\nE. The carbon-aluminum bonds in triisopropylaluminum are significantly stronger than those in trimethylaluminum due to the greater s-character in the C-Al bond of the secondary carbon. This intrinsic bond strength makes the monomeric form of triisopropylaluminum exceptionally stable, overriding any tendency to dimerize.", "solution": "The key bonding principle for trialkylaluminum compounds is that a monomeric $AlR_3$ unit is a Lewis-acidic, electron-deficient species. Aluminum has three valence electrons and forms three $\\sigma$ bonds to carbon, so the aluminum center possesses only six electrons in its valence shell. In electron-counting terms, this is $E_{\\text{Al}}=6$, which is deficient relative to an octet.\n\nA well-established way such electron-deficient main-group centers increase their stabilization is by aggregation through $3c-2e^-$ bridges. In $Al_2R_6$ dimers, two alkyl groups bridge the two aluminum atoms to form two $\\text{Al-C-Al}$ $3c-2e^-$ bonds. Each $3c-2e^-$ bond donates a shared electron pair across both aluminum centers, which effectively raises the electron count at each aluminum toward an octet. Qualitatively, going from monomer to dimer changes the effective electron environment at aluminum from $E_{\\text{Al}}=6$ in $AlR_3$ to approximately octet-like in $Al_2R_6$ due to two bridging interactions per aluminum. This electronic driving force explains why small-alkyl species such as trimethylaluminum readily form the bridged dimer $Al_2(CH_3)_6$.\n\nWhether this dimerization is feasible, however, also depends critically on steric effects. Formation of two $\\text{Al-C-Al}$ bridges requires the two aluminum centers to approach closely while accommodating four terminal alkyl groups and two bridging groups in the dimer. For $R = \\text{CH}_3$, the substituents are small and the steric penalty is modest, so the electronic stabilization from forming $3c-2e^-$ bridges dominates, yielding a stable dimer. For $R = i\\text{-C}_3\\text{H}_7$, the isopropyl groups are substantially bulkier; bringing two such $AlR_3$ units together into the bridged geometry creates severe nonbonded repulsions among the large substituents. In this case, the steric destabilization outweighs the electronic benefit of aggregation, so the monomer $Al(i\\text{-C}_3\\text{H}_7)_3$ is favored in non-coordinating solvents.\n\nAssessing the given statements against these principles:\n- A is incorrect: isopropyl groups are overall more electron-releasing than methyl by inductive/hyperconjugative effects, not more electron-withdrawing; and the dominant factor differentiating the two structures is sterics, not a drastic electronic withdrawal preventing coordination.\n- C is incorrect: dimerization is not primarily driven by van der Waals forces; it is driven by formation of stabilizing $3c-2e^-$ Al–C–Al bridges that alleviate electron deficiency.\n- D is incorrect: $AlR_3$ is not hypervalent; it is electron-deficient. Dimerization relieves deficiency, not hypervalency.\n- E is not the controlling factor: any modest variation in C–Al bond strength between primary and secondary alkyls does not override the strong steric penalty that prevents formation of the bridged dimer in the isopropyl case.\n\nTherefore, the accurate and comprehensive rationale is that electron deficiency drives dimerization, but steric bulk in triisopropylaluminum prevents the formation of the bridged dimer that small methyl groups readily allow, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2245196"}, {"introduction": "Boron chemistry is renowned for its beautiful and complex polyhedral hydride clusters, whose structures cannot be explained by simple Lewis theory.
