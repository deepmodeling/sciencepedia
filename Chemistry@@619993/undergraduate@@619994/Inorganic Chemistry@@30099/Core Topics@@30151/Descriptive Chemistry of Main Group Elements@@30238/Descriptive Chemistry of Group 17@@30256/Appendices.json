Upon mixing, the solution's color immediately changes to a distinct orange-brown. No precipitate is formed, and no gas is evolved during the reaction.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, which of the following statements correctly identifies the original potassium halide and the corresponding net ionic equation for the reaction that occurred?\n\nA.

This color change indicates that a chemical reaction has occurred, forming a new colored species. The known colors of the elemental halogens in aqueous solution are crucial here:\n- Cl$_2$(aq) is pale yellow-green.\n- Br$_2$(aq) is yellow-orange to orange-brown.\n- I$_2$(aq) is brown (or darker brown in the presence of excess I$^-$, forming I$_3^-$).\nThe observed orange-brown color is the characteristic color of aqueous bromine, Br$_2$(aq). Therefore, we can infer that the product of the reaction is elemental bromine.\n\nStep 2: Determine the identity of the halide ion.\nSince the product of the reaction is Br$_2$, the reactant halide ion must have been bromide, Br$^-$. This means the unknown potassium halide solution was potassium bromide, KBr.\n\nStep 3: Apply the principles of halogen displacement reactions.\nThe reactivity of halogens as oxidizing agents decreases down Group 17: F$_2 >$ Cl$_2 >$ Br$_2 >$ I$_2$. A halogen higher in the group (a stronger oxidizing agent) can oxidize a halide ion from a halogen lower in the group. In this case, chlorine (Cl$_2$) is above bromine (Br$_2$) in the periodic table, so chlorine is more reactive and can displace bromide ions from the solution.\nThe redox reaction involves the oxidation of bromide ions and the reduction of chlorine:\nOxidation: 2Br$^-$(aq) $\\rightarrow$ Br$_2$(aq) + 2e$^-$\nReduction: Cl$_2$(aq) + 2e$^-$ $\\rightarrow$ 2Cl$^-$(aq)\nThe overall reaction is feasible and consistent with the observed product formation.\n\nStep 4: Write the net ionic equation.\nFirst, we write the balanced molecular equation:\n$$\n\\text{Cl}_2(\\text{aq}) + 2\\text{KBr}(\\text{aq}) \\rightarrow 2\\text{KCl}(\\text{aq}) + \\text{Br}_2(\\text{aq})\n$$\nNext, we write the full ionic equation by dissociating all strong electrolytes:\n$$\n\\text{Cl}_2(\\text{aq}) + 2\\text{K}^{+}(\\text{aq}) + 2\\text{Br}^{-}(\\text{aq}) \\rightarrow 2\\text{K}^{+}(\\text{aq}) + 2\\text{Cl}^{-}(\\text{aq}) + \\text{Br}_2(\\text{aq})\n$$\nThe potassium ions, K$^+$(aq), appear on both sides of the equation and are spectator ions.

Incorrect. This option identifies the halide as KI. While Cl$_2$ does react with KI, the product would be I$_2$(aq), which is brown, not orange-brown.\nB. Incorrect. This option correctly identifies the halide as KBr, but it presents the full molecular equation, not the requested net ionic equation.\nC. Incorrect. This option identifies the halide as KF. Chlorine is less reactive than fluorine, so no reaction would occur. The proposed equation is also incorrect as F$_2$ is more reactive than Cl$_2$.\nD. Correct. This option correctly identifies the halide as potassium bromide (KBr) based on the formation of orange-brown Br$_2$(aq), and it provides the correct, balanced net ionic equation for the reaction.\nE. Incorrect. This option identifies the halide as KI. As noted for option A, the resulting color would be brown from I$_2$(aq), which does not match the observation.
