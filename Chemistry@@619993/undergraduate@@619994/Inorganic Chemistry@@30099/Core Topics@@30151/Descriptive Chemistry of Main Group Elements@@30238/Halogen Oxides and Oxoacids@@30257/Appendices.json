This practice utilizes the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, a fundamental predictive tool in chemistry. By comparing the chlorine dioxide radical ($ClO_2$) with the chlorite anion ($ClO_2^-$), you will explore the nuanced effects of different types of non-bonding electron domains—a lone pair versus a single unpaired electron—on molecular geometry and bond angles [@problem_id:2256278].", "problem": "The chlorine dioxide radical ($ClO_2$) and the chlorite anion ($ClO_2^-$) are two species containing chlorine and oxygen. While structurally similar, the number of valence electrons and their distribution lead to differences in their molecular geometries. Using the principles of the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, predict the relationship between the O–Cl–O bond angle in $ClO_2$ and the corresponding angle in $ClO_2^-$. Select the option that provides the correct comparison and the most accurate justification.\n\nA. The O–Cl–O angle in $ClO_2$ is larger than in $ClO_2^-$. This is because the central chlorine atom in $ClO_2^-$ has two lone pairs, which exert a stronger repulsion on the bonding pairs than the combination of one lone pair and one unpaired electron in $ClO_2$.\n\nB. The O–Cl–O angle in $ClO_2$ is smaller than in $ClO_2^-$. This is because the unpaired electron in $ClO_2$ is more spatially demanding than a lone pair, causing greater angle compression.\n\nC. The O–Cl–O angle in $ClO_2$ is smaller than in $ClO_2^-$. This is because the overall negative charge on $ClO_2^-$ causes the terminal oxygen atoms to repel each other more strongly, increasing the bond angle.\n\nD. The O–Cl–O angles are approximately equal. Both species have a bent geometry with two bonding pairs and non-bonding electrons on the central atom, leading to similar levels of angle compression from the ideal tetrahedral angle.\n\nE. The O–Cl–O angle in $ClO_2$ is larger than in $ClO_2^-$. This is because $ClO_2$ has a higher Cl–O bond order, and the increased electron density in these bonds pulls the oxygen atoms closer to the chlorine, thus reducing the angle between them.", "solution": "We apply VSEPR by determining the electron-domain arrangement around the central chlorine in each species and comparing the relative repulsions among electron domains.\n\nFirst, count total valence electrons:\n$$N_{v}(ClO_{2})=7+2\\times 6=19,$$\n$$N_{v}(ClO_{2}^{-})=7+2\\times 6+1=20.$$\n\nConstruct the Lewis skeleton with two Cl–O bonds and complete octets on the terminal oxygens first. For $ClO_{2}^{-}$, using two Cl–O single bonds accounts for $4$ electrons, and assigning three lone pairs to each oxygen uses $12$ more, for a subtotal of $16$. The remaining $20-16=4$ electrons must reside on chlorine as nonbonding electrons, i.e., two lone pairs. Thus, around chlorine there are two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, an $AX_{2}E_{2}$ set (bent), with electron-pair geometry approximately tetrahedral.\n\nFor $ClO_{2}$ (neutral radical), the same skeleton with two Cl–O bonds uses $4$ electrons, and three lone pairs on each oxygen again uses $12$, for a subtotal of $16$. The remaining $19-16=3$ electrons must be placed on chlorine as nonbonding electrons, i.e., one lone pair (two electrons) plus one unpaired electron (one electron). Therefore, around chlorine there are two bonding pairs, one lone pair, and one unpaired electron. In VSEPR, the unpaired electron occupies a nonbonding region but exerts less repulsion than a full lone pair.\n\nVSEPR repulsion strengths follow the qualitative order:\n$$\\text{lone pair–lone pair}>\\text{lone pair–bonding pair}>\\text{bonding pair–bonding pair},$$\nand a single (unpaired) electron produces even weaker repulsion than a lone pair. Consequently, the two lone pairs on chlorine in $ClO_{2}^{-}$ compress the O–Cl–O angle more strongly than does the combination of one lone pair and one unpaired electron in $ClO_{2}$. Therefore, the O–Cl–O bond angle in $ClO_{2}$ is larger than in $ClO_{2}^{-}$, and the correct justification is that two lone pairs on the anion create stronger repulsion than the lone-pair plus single-electron set in the radical.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2256278"}, {"introduction": "A molecule's structure directly influences its chemical properties, particularly its acidity.
