Consider two hypothetical polymorphic forms of a transition metal oxide, $\\text{MO}_2$. In both structures, the metal ion M is in a formal +4 oxidation state, exists in a high-spin $d^3$ electron configuration, and is surrounded by an octahedral array of $\\text{MO}_6$ ligands. The magnetic interaction between nearest-neighbor metal ions, mediated by the bridging oxide ligands (a phenomenon known as superexchange), can be described by the simplified Heisenberg Hamiltonian $H = -2J \\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j$, where $\\vec{S}_i$ and $\\vec{S}_j$ are the spin vectors of the adjacent metal ions and $J$ is the exchange coupling constant.

The Pauli exclusion principle favors a state where an electron can virtually hop from the oxygen to one metal and be replaced by an electron from the other metal. This process is most effective when the spins on the two metal ions are antiparallel. This leads to strong **antiferromagnetic (AFM)** coupling. According to the problem's convention, AFM coupling corresponds to a negative exchange constant. Thus, $J_{180} < 0$.\n\n**Lattice B (edge-sharing, 90° M–O–M):** In this geometry, the metal $t_{2g}$ orbitals interact with orthogonal $p$ orbitals on the bridging oxygen. The AFM pathway described above is suppressed. Instead, a different mechanism dominates. Virtual electron hopping from the two metal ions to these different oxygen orbitals is subject to Hund's rule on the oxygen atom, which favors parallel alignment of the electron spins. This preference is transmitted back to the metal ions, resulting in a **ferromagnetic (FM)** coupling. According to the problem's convention, FM coupling corresponds to a positive exchange constant. Thus, $J_{90} > 0$.\n\nTherefore, the expected signs are $J_{180} < 0$ (AFM) and $J_{90} > 0$ (FM), corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2252565"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice integrates the concepts of spin coupling and exchange mechanisms into a more complex, quantitative challenge.
