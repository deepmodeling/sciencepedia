To characterize the magnetic properties of this low-temperature phase, it is necessary to predict its theoretical magnetic moment.\n\nCalculate the theoretical spin-only magnetic moment ($\\mu_{so}$) for the iron(III) complex in its low-spin state. Express your answer in units of Bohr magnetons ($\\mu_B$), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the theoretical spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_{so}$, of a low-spin d⁵ complex. The iron(III) ion is specified as having a d⁵ electron configuration.\n\nThe first step is to determine the number of unpaired electrons, denoted by $n$, in a low-spin d⁵ complex. In coordination chemistry, the d orbitals of a central metal ion are split into different energy levels by the surrounding ligands. For a typical octahedral geometry, these orbitals split into a lower-energy set of three orbitals (the $t_{2g}$ set) and a higher-energy set of two orbitals (the $e_g$ set).\n\nThe term \"d⁵\" signifies that there are five electrons to be placed in these d orbitals. The term \"low-spin\" indicates that the crystal field splitting energy is large enough to overcome the electron-electron repulsion energy required to pair electrons in the same orbital. Therefore, electrons will fill the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals completely before any electrons occupy the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals.\n\nWe fill the orbitals for the d⁵ configuration as follows:\n1.  The first electron goes into one of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n2.  The second electron goes into another $t_{2g}$ orbital.\n3.  The third electron goes into the last empty $t_{2g}$ orbital. At this point, all three $t_{2g}$ orbitals are singly occupied.\n4.  The fourth electron pairs up with an electron in one of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n5.  The fifth electron pairs up with an electron in another of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n\nThe resulting electronic configuration is $(t_{2g})^5(e_g)^0$. Visually, this can be represented as:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ne_g: & \\underline{\\hspace{0.5cm}} \\hspace{0.5cm} \\underline{\\hspace{0.5cm}} \\\\\nt_{2g}: & \\underline{\\uparrow\\downarrow} \\hspace{0.5cm} \\underline{\\uparrow\\downarrow} \\hspace{0.5cm} \\underline{\\uparrow}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nBy counting the electrons without a pair, we find that there is only one unpaired electron. Thus, $n = 1$.\n\nThe next step is to use the spin-only formula to calculate the magnetic moment, $\\mu_{so}$. This formula is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}\n$$\nwhere the result is in units of Bohr magnetons ($\\mu_B$).\n\nSubstituting the value $n = 1$ into the formula:\n$$\n\\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{1(1+2)} = \\sqrt{1(3)} = \\sqrt{3} \\hspace{0.2cm} \\mu_B\n$$\n\nFinally, we need to provide a numerical answer rounded to three significant figures. The value of $\\sqrt{3}$ is approximately $1.7320508...$. Rounding this to three significant figures gives $1.73$.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical spin-only magnetic moment for the low-spin d⁵ complex is $1.73$ $\\mu_B$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.73}$$", "id": "2288824"}, {"introduction": "The essence of the spin crossover phenomenon is the transition between two distinct electronic configurations. Building upon the previous practice, this exercise focuses on quantifying the change that occurs during this event.

High-spin case ($\\Delta_{o} < P$): Electrons maximize spin by avoiding pairing until necessary.\n- Place three electrons singly in $t_{2g}$: $t_{2g}^{3}$.\n- Next two electrons singly in $e_{g}$: $e_{g}^{2}$, giving $t_{2g}^{3}e_{g}^{2}$ with $5$ unpaired at this stage.\n- The remaining two electrons pair in the lower $t_{2g}$ set: final configuration $t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{2}$.\n- Unpaired electrons: in $t_{2g}^{5}$ there is one unpaired; in $e_{g}^{2}$ there are two unpaired (one in each orbital). Hence $n_{\\text{high-spin}}=1+2=3$.\n\n2. Low-spin case ($\\Delta_{o} > P$): Electrons pair in $t_{2g}$ before occupying $e_{g}$.\n- Fill $t_{2g}$ completely with six electrons: $t_{2g}^{6}$ (all paired).\n- The seventh electron occupies $e_{g}$: $e_{g}^{1}$.\n- Unpaired electrons: $t_{2g}^{6}$ contributes $0$, $e_{g}^{1}$ contributes $1$.
