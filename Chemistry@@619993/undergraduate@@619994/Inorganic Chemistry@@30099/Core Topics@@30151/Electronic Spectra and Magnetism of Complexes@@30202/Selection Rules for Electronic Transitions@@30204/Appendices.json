The two primary selection rules for electronic transitions are the spin selection rule and the Laporte (or parity) selection rule. We will analyze the transition with respect to each rule.\n\n**1. The Spin Selection Rule**\n\nThe spin selection rule states that for an electronic transition to be \"allowed,\" the total spin quantum number, $S$, must not change. This is expressed as $\\Delta S = 0$. The spin multiplicity, which is the superscript in the term symbol, is given by $2S+1$.\n\nFor the ground state, ${^4T}_{1g}$:\nThe spin multiplicity is $4$.\nSo, $2S_{ground} + 1 = 4$.\nSolving for the total spin of the ground state:\n$2S_{ground} = 3$\n$S_{ground} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nFor the excited state, ${^2E}_g$:\nThe spin multiplicity is $2$.\nSo, $2S_{excited} + 1 = 2$.\nSolving for the total spin of the excited state:\n$2S_{excited} = 1$\n$S_{excited} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow, we calculate the change in the total spin quantum number, $\\Delta S$:\n$\\Delta S = S_{excited} - S_{ground} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} = -1$.\nThe magnitude of the change is $|\\Delta S| = 1$.\n\nSince $\\Delta S \\neq 0$, the spin selection rule is violated. This type of transition is referred to as \"spin-forbidden.\"\n\n**2. The Laporte Selection Rule**\n\nThe Laporte selection rule governs the change in parity of the electronic wavefunction. For a centrosymmetric molecule (a molecule with a center of inversion, such as an octahedral complex), an electronic transition is allowed only if it involves a change in parity. The parity is indicated by the subscript 'g' (for *gerade*, or even parity) or 'u' (for *ungerade*, or odd parity). The rule can be summarized as:\n- Allowed transitions: $g \\leftrightarrow u$\n- Forbidden transitions: $g \\to g$ and $u \\to u$\n\nAll d-orbitals in an octahedral field have *gerade* parity. Therefore, any term symbols arising from a d-electron configuration in an octahedral complex will have 'g' parity.\n\nIn the given transition, ${^4T}_{1g} \\to {^2E}_g$:\nThe ground state has *gerade* parity, as indicated by the subscript 'g'.\nThe excited state also has *gerade* parity, as indicated by the subscript 'g'.\n\nThe transition is therefore of the type $g \\to g$. Since there is no change in parity, the Laporte selection rule is violated. This type of transition is referred to as \"Laporte-forbidden\" or \"parity-forbidden.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe transition ${^4T}_{1g} \\to {^2E}_g$ violates both the spin selection rule ($\\Delta S \\neq 0$) and the Laporte selection rule ($g \\to g$). The fact that both rules are violated explains why the problem states that the absorption band is \"particularly weak,\" as doubly forbidden transitions have very low molar absorptivities.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA.

This final exercise bridges the gap between theoretical rules and practical spectroscopy by asking you to interpret a measured molar absorptivity, $\\epsilon$. By connecting the intensity of an absorption band to whether a transition is allowed or forbidden, you'll develop the critical skill of using spectroscopic data to diagnose the nature of an electronic process, a key technique in chemical analysis.

The transition is a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band.", "solution": "The intensity of an electronic absorption band, quantified by the molar absorptivity ($\\epsilon$), is determined by the selection rules for electronic transitions. There are two main selection rules to consider: the Laporte selection rule and the spin selection rule.\n\n1.  **The Spin Selection Rule**: This rule states that for a transition to be \"allowed,\" the total spin quantum number ($S$) must not change. In other words, $\\Delta S = 0$. Transitions where $\\Delta S \\neq 0$ are \"spin-forbidden.\" Spin-forbidden transitions are typically very weak, with molar absorptivity values usually less than $1 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n\n2.  **The Laporte Selection Rule**: This rule applies to centrosymmetric molecules and complexes (i.e., those possessing a center of inversion, $i$). Octahedral complexes, like the $[\\text{M(L)}_6]^{n+}$ described, are centrosymmetric. The rule states that allowed transitions must involve a change in parity. Orbitals are classified as either gerade (g, symmetric with respect to inversion) or ungerade (u, antisymmetric with respect to inversion). Allowed transitions must be g $\\leftrightarrow$ u. Transitions between orbitals of the same parity (g $\\leftrightarrow$ g or u $\\leftrightarrow$ u) are \"Laporte-forbidden.\"\n    - In a transition metal complex, the d-orbitals are of gerade symmetry. Therefore, d-d transitions are inherently g $\\rightarrow$ g and are Laporte-forbidden.\n    - Laporte-forbidden transitions are not completely unobserved; they become weakly allowed through a mechanism called vibronic coupling, where molecular vibrations temporarily break the center of symmetry. This results in characteristically low molar absorptivities, typically in the range of $1 < \\epsilon < 100 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n\n3.  **Fully Allowed Transitions**: Transitions that are both spin-allowed ($\\Delta S = 0$) and Laporte-allowed (g $\\leftrightarrow$ u) are very intense. These include charge transfer bands, such as Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT) or Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT). Their molar absorptivities are typically large, often $\\epsilon > 1000 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n\nNow we analyze the given data. The problem states that the observed absorption band has a molar absorptivity $\\epsilon = 14 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. Let's evaluate this value against the typical ranges:\n-   The value $14$ is much greater than $1$, which makes it highly unlikely to be a spin-forbidden transition.\n-   The value $14$ is much less than $1000$, which makes it highly unlikely to be a fully allowed transition like a charge transfer band.\n-   The value $14$ falls squarely within the range $1 < \\epsilon < 100 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}$, which is characteristic of transitions that are Laporte-forbidden but spin-allowed. This is the typical intensity for d-d electronic transitions in centrosymmetric (e.g., octahedral) complexes.\n\nLet's examine the options based on this analysis:\nA. **The transition is Laporte-forbidden but spin-allowed.** This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The intensity is consistent with a d-d transition in an octahedral complex.\nB. **The transition is fully allowed (both Laporte- and spin-allowed).** This is incorrect. A fully allowed transition would have a much higher $\\epsilon$.\nC. **The transition is spin-forbidden but Laporte-allowed.** This is incorrect. A spin-forbidden transition would have a much lower $\\epsilon$ (typically < 1).\nD. **The transition is both Laporte-forbidden and spin-forbidden.** This is incorrect. Such a transition would be extremely weak, with $\\epsilon \\ll 1 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\nE. **The transition is a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band.** This is incorrect. LMCT bands are a type of fully allowed transition and exhibit much higher molar absorptivities.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that the transition is Laporte-forbidden, as expected for a d-d transition in an octahedral complex, but spin-allowed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2287163"}]}
