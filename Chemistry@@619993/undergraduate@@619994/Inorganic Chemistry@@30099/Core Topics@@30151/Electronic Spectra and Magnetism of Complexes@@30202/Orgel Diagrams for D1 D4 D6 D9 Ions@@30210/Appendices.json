These diagrams illustrate the splitting of free-ion term symbols in the presence of a ligand field. The appearance of an Orgel diagram is determined by a combination of the metal ion's d-electron count and the geometry of the complex (e.g., octahedral or tetrahedral). A key concept in this context is the hole formalism, which relates the electronic states of a $d^n$ configuration to a $d^{10-n}$ configuration.\n\nConsidering these principles, an Orgel diagram for a specific d-electron configuration in one geometry can be identical to the diagram for a different configuration in another geometry.

A $d^9$ tetrahedral complex", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify which high-spin tetrahedral (Td) d-electron configuration ($d^n$) has an Orgel diagram identical to that of a high-spin octahedral (Oh) $d^1$ complex. To solve this, we need to understand how Orgel diagrams are related across different electron counts and geometries.\n\nThere are two fundamental relationships that govern Orgel diagrams:\n\n1.  **Hole Formalism within the same geometry**: The Orgel diagram for a $d^{10-n}$ configuration is the inverse of the diagram for a $d^n$ configuration in the *same* geometry. For example, the diagram for a $d^9$ Oh complex is an inverted version of the diagram for a $d^1$ Oh complex. This is because the free-ion term for both is a $D$ term, but the single electron in $d^1$ occupies a low-energy orbital, while the single hole in $d^9$ occupies a high-energy orbital, leading to an inversion of the ground and excited states.\n\n2.  **Geometry Inversion for the same electron count**: The energy splitting of d-orbitals in a tetrahedral field is the inverse of the splitting in an octahedral field. Consequently, the Orgel diagram for a $d^n$ Td complex is the inverse of the diagram for a $d^n$ Oh complex.\n\nCombining these two principles gives us a powerful shortcut. We are looking for a $d^n$ Td complex whose diagram is identical to a $d^1$ Oh complex.\n\nLet's start with the $d^1$ Oh diagram. We want to find a $d^n$ Td diagram that is identical to it.\nUsing rule #2, the diagram for a $d^n$ Td complex is the *inverse* of the diagram for a $d^n$ Oh complex.\nSo, our target $d^n$ Td diagram is equivalent to an *(inverted $d^n$ Oh diagram)*.\n\nWe want this *(inverted $d^n$ Oh diagram)* to be identical to the *($d^1$ Oh diagram)*.\n\nNow, let's use rule #1. The diagram for a $d^{10-n}$ Oh complex is the *inverse* of the diagram for a $d^n$ Oh complex.\nThis means an *(inverted $d^n$ Oh diagram)* is identical to a *($d^{10-n}$ Oh diagram)*.\n\nBy combining these statements, we find that the *($d^1$ Oh diagram)* must be identical to the *($d^{10-n}$ Oh diagram)*. This can only be true if the electron counts are the same.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$1 = 10 - n$$\nSolving this equation for $n$:\n$$n = 10 - 1 = 9$$\n\nThis result tells us that a $d^9$ tetrahedral complex has an Orgel diagram that is identical to a $d^1$ octahedral complex.\n\nLet's verify this using term symbols.\n-   **$d^1$ Octahedral (Oh)**: The free-ion ground term is $^2D$. In an octahedral field, the d-orbitals split into a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy $e_g$ set. The single electron resides in a $t_{2g}$ orbital, so the ground state is $^2T_{2g}$. The only possible d-d electronic transition promotes this electron to the $e_g$ set, resulting in the excited state $^2E_g$. The Orgel diagram shows a single transition from a $^2T_{2g}$ ground state to a $^2E_g$ excited state.\n\n-   **$d^9$ Tetrahedral (Td)**: The free-ion ground term is also $^2D$. In a tetrahedral field, the d-orbitals split into a lower-energy $e$ set and a higher-energy $t_2$ set. The electron configuration is $e^4t_2^5$. This configuration has a single \"hole\" in the higher-energy $t_2$ orbitals. The term symbol for a single hole in a set of orbitals is the same as for a single electron in that same set of orbitals. Therefore, the ground state for a $d^9$ Td complex is $^2T_2$. An electronic transition involves promoting an electron from the filled $e$ set to fill the hole in the $t_2$ set. This is equivalent to moving the hole from the $t_2$ orbitals to the $e$ orbitals. The resulting excited state is $^2E$. The Orgel diagram thus shows a single transition from a $^2T_2$ ground state to a $^2E$ excited state.\n\nComparing the two cases (ignoring the g/u subscripts which are not relevant for tetrahedral geometry), both have a $^2T$ ground state and a $^2E$ excited state. Their Orgel diagrams are therefore identical.\n\nThus, a $d^9$ tetrahedral complex corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2276203"}]}
