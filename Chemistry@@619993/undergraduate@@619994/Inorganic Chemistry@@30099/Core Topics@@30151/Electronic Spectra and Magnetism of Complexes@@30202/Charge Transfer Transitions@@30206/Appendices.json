By analyzing the trends in the metal's oxidation state across the periodic table, you can build a qualitative model to predict the relative energies of the metal's d-orbitals and, consequently, the energy required for the LMCT excitation.", "problem": "A chemist is investigating a series of isoelectronic tetrahedral oxoanions of first-row transition metals: vanadate ($[\\text{VO}_4]^{3-}$), chromate ($[\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-}$), and permanganate ($[\\text{MnO}_4]^-$). The characteristic and often intense colors of these ions are attributed to electronic transitions known as Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT) bands. In this process, an electron is excited from a molecular orbital that is primarily ligand-based (in this case, oxygen lone pairs) to an empty molecular orbital that is primarily metal d-orbital in character. To build a predictive model for the optical properties of such materials, the chemist needs to establish the correct energy ordering of these LMCT transitions for the given series.\n\nBased on the periodic trends affecting the energies of metal d-orbitals, which of the following options correctly ranks the anions in order of **increasing** LMCT transition energy?\n\nA. $[\\text{VO}_4]^{3-}  [\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-}  [\\text{MnO}_4]^-$\n\nB. $[\\text{MnO}_4]^-  [\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-}  [\\text{VO}_4]^{3-}$\n\nC. $[\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-}  [\\text{MnO}_4]^-  [\\text{VO}_4]^{3-}$\n\nD. $[\\text{MnO}_4]^-  [\\text{VO}_4]^{3-}  [\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-}$\n\nE. All three anions have the same LMCT energy because they are isoelectronic.", "solution": "The problem asks us to rank the tetraoxoanions $[\\text{VO}_4]^{3-}$, $[\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-}$, and $[\\text{MnO}_4]^-$ in order of increasing energy for their Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT) transitions.\n\nThe energy of an LMCT transition, $\\Delta E_{LMCT}$, corresponds to the energy difference between the filled ligand-based molecular orbital (the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, HOMO) and the empty metal-based molecular orbital (the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital, LUMO). In these oxoanions, the HOMO is primarily composed of oxygen $2p$ orbitals, and the LUMO is primarily composed of the empty $d$ orbitals of the central transition metal.\n\nLet's analyze each component of the energy gap, $\\Delta E_{LMCT} = E_{LUMO(metal)} - E_{HOMO(ligand)}$.\n\nFirst, for a comparative analysis of this series, we can assume that the energy of the ligand-based HOMO (oxygen $2p$ orbitals) is approximately constant across the three anions, as the ligand is the same (oxide, $O^{2-}$). Therefore, the trend in $\\Delta E_{LMCT}$ will be dominated by the trend in the energy of the metal-based LUMO.\n\nNext, we must determine the oxidation state of the central metal atom in each anion. We assume the oxide ligand has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nFor vanadate, $[\\text{VO}_4]^{3-}$:\nLet the oxidation state of Vanadium be $x$.\n$x + 4(-2) = -3$\n$x - 8 = -3$\n$x = +5$\nSo, we have Vanadium(V). The electron configuration of V is $[Ar] 3d^3 4s^2$. For $V^{5+}$, the configuration is $[Ar] 3d^0$.\n\nFor chromate, $[\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-}$:\nLet the oxidation state of Chromium be $y$.\n$y + 4(-2) = -2$\n$y - 8 = -2$\n$y = +6$\nSo, we have Chromium(VI). The electron configuration of Cr is $[Ar] 3d^5 4s^1$. For $Cr^{6+}$, the configuration is $[Ar] 3d^0$.\n\nFor permanganate, $[\\text{MnO}_4]^-$:\nLet the oxidation state of Manganese be $z$.\n$z + 4(-2) = -1$\n$z - 8 = -1$\n$z = +7$\nSo, we have Manganese(VII). The electron configuration of Mn is $[Ar] 3d^5 4s^2$. For $Mn^{7+}$, the configuration is $[Ar] 3d^0$.\n\nAll three metal centers have a $d^0$ electron configuration, which is why the lowest energy electronic transition is an LMCT transition (there are no `$d-d$` transitions possible). The transition promotes an electron from the oxygen-based HOMO to the empty d-orbitals of the metal (the LUMO).\n\nThe energy of the metal's d-orbitals is highly dependent on the metal's oxidation state. As the oxidation state increases, the positive charge on the metal nucleus becomes less shielded, and the effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence orbitals increases. This increased positive charge strongly stabilizes the d-orbitals, lowering their energy.\n\nThe oxidation states of the metals in the series are V(+5), Cr(+6), and Mn(+7). As we move from V to Cr to Mn, the oxidation state increases. Consequently, the energy of the empty d-orbitals (the LUMO) decreases in the same order.\n$E_{d-orbitals}(Mn^{7+})  E_{d-orbitals}(Cr^{6+})  E_{d-orbitals}(V^{5+})$\n\nSince the energy of the ligand-based HOMO is roughly constant, the energy gap, $\\Delta E_{LMCT}$, will follow the same trend as the energy of the metal LUMO. A lower energy LUMO results in a smaller energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO.\n\nTherefore, the LMCT transition energy order is:\n$\\Delta E_{LMCT}([\\text{MnO}_4]^-)  \\Delta E_{LMCT}([\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-})  \\Delta E_{LMCT}([\\text{VO}_4]^{3-})$\n\nThis theoretical ranking is consistent with the observed colors of these ions. $[\\text{MnO}_4]^-$ has the lowest energy transition, absorbing green light and appearing intensely purple. $[\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-}$ has a higher energy transition, absorbing blue-violet light and appearing yellow. $[\\text{VO}_4]^{3-}$ has the highest energy transition, which falls in the ultraviolet region, making the ion colorless in solution.\n\nThe question asks for the order of *increasing* LMCT energy. This corresponds to the ranking:\n$[\\text{MnO}_4]^-  [\\text{CrO}_4]^{2-}  [\\text{VO}_4]^{3-}$\n\nThis matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2238229"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the role of the metal acceptor, we now turn our attention to the ligand donor.

What happens when a highly oxidizing metal is paired with a very easily oxidized ligand?

The $Au^{3+}$ ion is known to be a potent oxidizing agent. The chemist first successfully synthesizes the tetrafluoroaurate(III) complex, $[\\text{AuF}_4]^-$, which is a stable, yellow-orange solid.

The iodide ion is known to be a strong reducing agent.\n\nBased on the principles of ligand field theory and redox chemistry, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this second synthetic attempt and provides the correct underlying electronic-structure rationale?\n\nA. A stable, deeply colored complex, $[\\text{AuI}_4]^-$, will form. The color is due to a low-energy Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) transition, where an electron is excited from a gold-centered orbital to a ligand-centered orbital.\n\nB. The synthesis will fail because the complex is unstable and undergoes spontaneous decomposition. This instability is due to the very low energy of a Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) state, which facilitates a permanent redox reaction where $Au^{3+}$ is oxidized and $I^-$ is reduced.\n\nC. A stable, pale-yellow complex, $[\\text{AuI}_4]^-$, will form. The color is primarily due to weak `$d-d$` electronic transitions, similar to many other transition metal complexes.\n\nD. The synthesis will fail because the complex is unstable and undergoes spontaneous decomposition. This instability is due to the very low energy of a Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT) state, which facilitates a permanent redox reaction where $Au^{3+}$ is reduced and $I^-$ is oxidized.\n\nE. A stable, colorless complex, $[\\text{AuI}_4]^-$, will form. The energy gap between the ligand-based and metal-based orbitals is too large for an absorption in the visible spectrum.", "solution": "First, identify the electronic structure of the metal center and the ligands. The $Au^{3+}$ ion is a $d^{8}$ center, which in a four-coordinate environment typically adopts a square-planar ligand field with a high-lying antibonding metal-centered orbital of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ character. Halide ligands are anionic donors with filled $p$ orbitals; across the halide series, the donor orbital energies increase from $F^{-}$ to $I^{-}$, and the ease of oxidation (reducing power) increases correspondingly.\n\nSecond, analyze the types of electronic excitations relevant to halide complexes of high-valent late transition metals. With anionic halide ligands, the dominant charge-transfer transition is Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT), in which an electron is excited from a ligand-centered filled $p$ orbital into a metal-centered acceptor orbital (e.g., the antibonding $d_{x^2-y^2}$ or higher-lying $6s/6p$ hybridized acceptors). The energy of LMCT transitions decreases markedly as the ligand becomes more easily oxidized and its donor orbitals lie higher in energy; thus LMCT energies decrease from $F^{-}$ to $I^{-}$.\n\nThird, connect LMCT energetics to thermodynamics of redox. For a strongly oxidizing metal center such as $Au^{3+}$ and a strongly reducing ligand such as $I^{-}$, the LMCT state becomes very low in energy and can couple to an actual redox process that produces thermodynamically stable products. In effect, population of the LMCT state corresponds to electron transfer from $I^{-}$ to $Au^{3+}$, leading to reduction of the metal and oxidation of iodide. The relevant half-reactions are\n$$\nAu^{3+} + 2 e^{-} \\to Au^{+}, \\quad 2 I^{-} \\to I_{2} + 2 e^{-},\n$$\nwhich combine to give\n$$\nAu^{3+} + 2 I^{-} \\to Au^{+} + I_{2}.\n$$\nAlternatively, deeper reduction may occur:\n$$\nAu^{3+} + 3 e^{-} \\to Au, \\quad 2 I^{-} \\to I_{2} + 2 e^{-},\n$$\nwhich upon appropriate electron balancing yields, for example,\n$$\n2 Au^{3+} + 6 I^{-} \\to 2 Au + 3 I_{2}.\n$$\nThese balanced equations symbolically represent the permanent redox decomposition driven by the low-energy LMCT pathway.\n\nFourth, compare with the fluoride case. For $[\\text{AuF}_4]^-$, $F^{-}$ is a very poor reducing agent with low-lying $2p$ orbitals; the LMCT transition is at high energy and does not couple to a favorable ground-state redox process, so the complex is stable. In contrast, for the attempted $[\\text{AuI}_4]^-$, the LMCT is so low in energy that it facilitates irreversible electron transfer: $Au^{3+}$ is reduced to $Au^{+}$ or $Au^{0}$ and $I^{-}$ is oxidized to $I_{2}$ (or polyiodide), preventing the isolation of a stable $[\\text{AuI}_4]^-$ complex.\n\nFifth, evaluate the options against these principles:\n- Option A incorrectly predicts stability and invokes MLCT (wrong direction for halide donors).\n- Option B invokes MLCT and the wrong redox direction (it claims $Au^{3+}$ is oxidized and $I^{-}$ reduced), which contradicts the known oxidizing power of $Au^{3+}$ and reducing nature of $I^{-}$.\n- Option C attributes color to `$d-d$` transitions and predicts stability; in such high-valent halide complexes, charge-transfer dominates, and the complex is not stable.\n- Option D correctly states that the synthesis fails due to instability arising from a very low-energy LMCT state that drives a permanent redox reaction in which $Au^{3+}$ is reduced and $I^{-}$ is oxidized.\n- Option E is inconsistent with the strong donor/acceptor nature of $I^{-}$/$Au^{3+}$ and the observed chemistry.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction and rationale are given by Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2238263"}]}
