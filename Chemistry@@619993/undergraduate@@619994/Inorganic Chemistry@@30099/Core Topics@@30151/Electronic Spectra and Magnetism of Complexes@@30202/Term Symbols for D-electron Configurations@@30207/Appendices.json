A neutral titanium atom (Ti) has an atomic number of $Z=22$, so it has 22 electrons. Its ground state electron configuration is $[\\text{Ar}] 3d^2 4s^2$. The Ti$^{2+}$ ion is formed by removing the two electrons with the highest principal quantum number, which are the $4s$ electrons. Therefore, the electron configuration of Ti$^{2+}$ is $[\\text{Ar}] 3d^2$. We need to find the term symbol for the two electrons in the 3d subshell.\n\nThe determination of the ground state term symbol ${}^{2S+1}L_J$ involves applying Hund's rules in order:\n1.  Maximize the total spin quantum number, $S$.\n2.  For a given $S$, maximize the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$.\n3.  For a given $S$ and $L$, determine the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$.\n\n**Step 1: Maximize Total Spin (S)**\nThe d-subshell has five orbitals, with magnetic orbital quantum numbers ($m_l$) of -2, -1, 0, +1, and +2. According to Hund's first rule, the state of lowest energy is the one with the maximum total spin $S$. To achieve this, the two 3d electrons must occupy different orbitals and have parallel spins.\nLet's place the two electrons with parallel spins ($m_s = +1/2$ for each). The total spin quantum number is the sum of the individual spin quantum numbers:\n$$S = \\sum m_s = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$$\nThe spin multiplicity is given by $2S+1$:\n$$2S+1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$$\nThis means the ground state is a triplet state. This immediately eliminates options B ($^1\\text{G}_4$) and E ($^1\\text{D}_2$), as they are singlet states (multiplicity of 1).\n\n**Step 2: Maximize Total Orbital Angular Momentum (L)**\nAccording to Hund's second rule, for a given spin multiplicity, the state with the highest total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ is the most stable. To maximize $L$, we must place the two unpaired electrons in the orbitals with the highest possible $m_l$ values. The available $m_l$ values are +2, +1, 0, -1, -2. We place one electron in the $m_l = +2$ orbital and the other in the $m_l = +1$ orbital.\nThe total orbital angular momentum projection, $M_L = \\sum m_l$, is calculated for this arrangement:\n$$M_L = (+2) + (+1) = 3$$\nThe term's total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$, is equal to the maximum possible value of $M_L$. Thus, the ground term has $L=3$.\nThe letter code corresponding to $L=3$ is 'F'. Therefore, the ground state term is $^3\\text{F}$. This eliminates option C ($^3\\text{P}_0$), which corresponds to $L=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Total Angular Momentum (J)**\nHund's third rule helps us determine the value of the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$. The possible values for $J$ range from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps.\nWith $L=3$ and $S=1$, the possible $J$ values are:\n$$J = |3-1|, \\dots, 3+1$$\n$$J = 2, 3, 4$$\nThe rule for selecting the ground state $J$ value depends on the occupancy of the subshell. The 3d subshell can hold a maximum of 10 electrons. Since the Ti$^{2+}$ ion has a $3d^2$ configuration, the subshell is less than half-filled. For subshells that are less than half-filled, the ground state level is the one with the minimum $J$ value.\nThe minimum value among the possible $J$ values (2, 3, 4) is $J=2$.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Term Symbol**\nCombining the multiplicity ($2S+1=3$), the orbital angular momentum letter (F), and the total angular momentum ($J=2$), we obtain the full ground state term symbol ${}^{2S+1}L_J = {}^3\\text{F}_2$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option D.
