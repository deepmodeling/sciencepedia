The cobalt(II) ion is specified as having a $d^7$ electron configuration.\n\nStep 1: Determine the magnetic moment of Complex A.\nComplex A is a low-spin octahedral $d^7$ complex. In an octahedral crystal field, the five degenerate d-orbitals split into two sets: a lower-energy triply degenerate set ($t_{2g}$) and a higher-energy doubly degenerate set ($e_g$). For a low-spin configuration, electrons will first fill the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals completely before occupying the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals. The aufbau principle for a low-spin $d^7$ ion is as follows:\n- The first six electrons pair up in the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n- The seventh electron enters one of the $e_g$ orbitals.\nThe resulting electron configuration is $t_{2g}^6 e_g^1$.\nTo find the number of unpaired electrons, $n_A$, we examine this configuration. The $t_{2g}$ orbitals are fully filled, containing three pairs of electrons, so there are no unpaired electrons in this set. The $e_g$ set contains a single electron, which is unpaired.\nThus, the number of unpaired electrons for Complex A is $n_A = 1$.\nUsing the provided formula for the spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}$:\n$\\mu_{so}(\\text{Complex A}) = \\sqrt{1(1+2)} = \\sqrt{3} \\ \\mu_B$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the magnetic moment of Complex B.\nComplex B is a high-spin tetrahedral $d^7$ complex. In a tetrahedral crystal field, the d-orbitals also split into two sets, but the splitting is inverted compared to the octahedral case. There is a lower-energy doubly degenerate set ($e$) and a higher-energy triply degenerate set ($t_2$). Tetrahedral complexes have a smaller crystal field splitting energy ($\\Delta_t$), so they are almost always high-spin. For a high-spin configuration, electrons occupy all available orbitals singly before any pairing occurs (Hund's rule).\nThe filling for a high-spin $d^7$ ion is as follows:\n- The first two electrons singly occupy the two $e$ orbitals.\n- The next three electrons singly occupy the three $t_2$ orbitals. At this point, we have placed 5 electrons, one in each d-orbital.\n- The remaining two electrons (the 6th and 7th) must pair up. They will enter the lower-energy $e$ orbitals.\nThe resulting electron configuration is $e^4 t_2^3$.\nTo find the number of unpaired electrons, $n_B$, we examine this configuration. The $e$ orbitals are fully filled with four electrons (two pairs), so there are no unpaired electrons in this set. The $t_2$ set contains three electrons, each in a different orbital. These three electrons are unpaired.\nThus, the number of unpaired electrons for Complex B is $n_B = 3$.\nUsing the spin-only formula again:\n$\\mu_{so}(\\text{Complex B}) = \\sqrt{3(3+2)} = \\sqrt{15} \\ \\mu_B$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the required ratio.\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{\\mu_{so}(\\text{Complex B})}{\\mu_{so}(\\text{Complex A})}$.\nRatio = $\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{\\sqrt{3}}$\nThis can be simplified as:\nRatio = $\\sqrt{\\frac{15}{3}} = \\sqrt{5}$\nFinally, we need to express this as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.\n$\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.2360679...$\nRounding to three significant figures gives 2.24.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.24}$$", "id": "2289058"}]}
