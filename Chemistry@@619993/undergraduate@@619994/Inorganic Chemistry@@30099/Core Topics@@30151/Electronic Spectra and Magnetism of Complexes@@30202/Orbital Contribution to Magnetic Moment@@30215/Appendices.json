You will examine two octahedral $d^4$ complexes—one high-spin and one low-spin—to understand why their magnetic properties differ so dramatically despite having the same metal ion and geometry.

The spin-only magnetic moment can be calculated relatively simply, but the orbital contribution is often \"quenched\" or eliminated by the ligand field. However, in certain cases, a significant orbital contribution remains, leading to an experimental magnetic moment that is considerably different from the spin-only value. This phenomenon is directly linked to the degeneracy of the ground state electronic term.\n\nConsider two different octahedral complexes of a metal ion with a $d^4$ electron configuration. One complex is high-spin, resulting from a weak-field ligand environment, while the other is low-spin, resulting from a strong-field ligand environment. It is observed that the low-spin complex exhibits a magnetic moment that suggests a significant orbital contribution, whereas the magnetic moment of the high-spin complex is very close to its spin-only value.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct fundamental reason for this observed difference in magnetic behavior?\n\nA. The low-spin $d^4$ complex has a ground state term with T symmetry (which is orbitally triply degenerate), allowing for orbital angular momentum. In contrast, the high-spin $d^4$ complex has a ground state term with E symmetry (which is orbitally doubly degenerate), for which the orbital angular momentum is quenched.\n\nB. The high-spin $d^4$ complex has more unpaired electrons, and the resulting large spin-exchange energy completely cancels any possible orbital contribution, a phenomenon not seen in the low-spin case.\n\nC. The low-spin configuration ($t_{2g}^4$) is spherically symmetric, which enhances orbital motion, while the high-spin configuration ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^1$) is asymmetric, which restricts it.\n\nD. The Jahn-Teller effect, which is the sole source of orbital angular momentum, is much more pronounced in low-spin $d^4$ complexes than in high-spin $d^4$ complexes.\n\nE. Orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is only possible when the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals are completely empty, a condition that is met only by the low-spin $d^4$ complex.", "solution": "The spin-only magnetic moment for a complex with $n$ unpaired electrons is given by\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{SO}}=\\sqrt{n(n+2)}\\,\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}},\n$$\nwhich ignores any orbital contribution.

In an octahedral field, the components of the orbital angular momentum operator transform as $T_{1g}$, and only terms that carry an effective orbital angular momentum (i.e., transform like a triply degenerate $T$ representation) support an unquenched orbital moment to first order. By contrast, $A$ terms are nondegenerate and $E$ terms, although doubly degenerate, do not carry an effective orbital angular momentum in first order; they are usually treated as having $\\tilde{L}=0$, so their orbital contribution is largely quenched.\n\nFor a $d^4$ ion:\n- In a weak-field (high-spin) octahedral complex, the configuration is $t_{2g}^3e_g^1$ with $S=2$ (fivefold spin multiplicity). The ground term correlates as $^5E_g$ (from the free-ion $^5D$ term).

This permits first-order spin-orbit coupling within the $T$ manifold and yields a significant orbital contribution to the magnetic moment.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental reason for the observed difference is the difference in orbital degeneracy of the ground electronic term: the low-spin $d^4$ complex has a $T$-symmetry ground term that allows unquenched orbital angular momentum, while the high-spin $d^4$ complex has an $E$-symmetry ground term for which orbital angular momentum is quenched in first order. This corresponds exactly to statement A. The other options are incorrect: spin-exchange does not cancel orbital contributions (B); $t_{2g}^4$ is not spherically symmetric (C); the Jahn-Teller effect is not the sole source of orbital angular momentum and generally lifts degeneracy, tending to quench it (D); and occupancy of $e_g$ is not the criterion for orbital contributions (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2275688"}, {"introduction": "To solidify your understanding, this final exercise addresses a key boundary condition using a low-spin octahedral $d^6$ complex. Although the degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbitals are occupied, the complex is diamagnetic, with a fully quenched orbital moment. This problem guides you to resolve this apparent contradiction by applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle, revealing why a completely filled degenerate subshell cannot support the electron circulation necessary for an orbital contribution [@problem_id:2275675].", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, the total magnetic moment of a complex arises from contributions from both the electron spin and the electron's orbital motion. A low-spin octahedral complex with a $d^6$ electron configuration, such as the hexacyanocobaltate(III) ion, $\\text{[Co(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{3-}$, is observed to be diamagnetic. This indicates that its spin-only magnetic moment is zero. However, for the total magnetic moment to be zero, the orbital contribution must also be zero. The $t_{2g}$ orbitals ($d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) are degenerate and can be interconverted by rotation about a Cartesian axis, a primary condition for generating orbital angular momentum. Despite this, the orbital contribution is fully quenched in this case.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental reason for the absence of an orbital contribution to the magnetic moment in a low-spin octahedral $d^6$ complex?\n\nA. Orbital contribution is always quenched in low-spin complexes regardless of the d-electron count because the strong ligand field locks the electrons in place.\n\nB. According to Hund's rules, the ground state must have maximum multiplicity, which inherently prevents orbital angular momentum.\n\nC. The energy gap, $\\Delta_o$, between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is very large, preventing the electron circulation necessary for an orbital contribution.\n\nD. For an orbital contribution to exist, an electron must be able to circulate among degenerate orbitals. In a $t_{2g}^6$ configuration, all degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbitals are completely filled, preventing any such circulation due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\nE. Any potential orbital angular momentum generated by the spin-up electrons in the $t_{2g}$ set is perfectly cancelled by an equal and opposite orbital angular momentum from the spin-down electrons.", "solution": "We analyze the total magnetic moment as the vector sum of spin and orbital contributions. In atomic units, the spin-only magnetic moment depends on the total spin $S$ as $\\mu_{S} \\propto \\sqrt{S(S+1)}$, and the orbital contribution depends on the total orbital angular momentum $L$ as $\\mu_{L} \\propto \\sqrt{L(L+1)}$. For a low-spin octahedral $d^6$ complex such as $\\text{[Co(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{3-}$, the configuration is $t_{2g}^6e_g^0$, so all electrons are paired and $S=0$, giving $\\mu_{S}=0$.\n\nTo explain why $\\mu_{L}=0$, we invoke the fundamental condition for an unquenched orbital moment: a nonzero $\\mathbf{L}$ arises only when electrons can circulate among degenerate orbitals of the same energy, i.e., there must be an available unoccupied state within the degenerate manifold that allows the electron’s phase to evolve coherently under rotations. In ligand-field terms, the $t_{2g}$ set is triply degenerate, and in the absence of filling constraints, this degeneracy can support an “effective” orbital angular momentum (often described by an effective $l=1$ within the $t_{2g}$ manifold). However, in the $t_{2g}^6$ case, all three $t_{2g}$ orbitals are doubly occupied, so:\n- By the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no electron can be promoted or hop into another $t_{2g}$ orbital of the same energy without violating occupancy constraints; there is no empty $t_{2g}$ state to support first-order circulation within the degenerate set.\n- Group-theoretically, the strong-field ground term for $t_{2g}^6e_g^0$ is $^1A_{1g}$, where “$A$” denotes an orbital singlet. For an orbital singlet, the matrix elements of $\\mathbf{L}$ within the ground multiplet vanish, which implies $L=0$ and hence $\\mu_{L}=0$ to first order.\n- Equivalently, viewing the $t_{2g}$ set as carrying an effective orbital angular momentum, the completely filled set is a closed subshell. Summing the contributions over all filled components yields $L=0$, since full occupancy fills all effective $m_{l}$ components in pairs and the net orbital angular momentum cancels.\n\nThis directly rules out the distractors:\n- A is incorrect because low spin does not guarantee complete quenching; unquenched orbital contributions can remain when the degenerate set is partially filled.\n- B misapplies Hund’s rules; maximum multiplicity does not inherently eliminate orbital angular momentum, and in any case the present complex is low spin with $S=0$.\n- C is incorrect because the orbital moment arises from mixing within the $t_{2g}$ manifold; it does not require promotion across $\\Delta_{o}$ to $e_{g}$.\n- E is incorrect because orbital contributions do not cancel between spin-up and spin-down electrons in the same spatial orbital; orbital cancellation arises from filling all orbital components (i.e., opposite $m_{l}$), not from opposite spins.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is that in a $t_{2g}^6$ configuration the degenerate set is completely filled, so Pauli blocking prevents the electron circulation among degenerate orbitals that is required to generate orbital angular momentum, yielding an orbital singlet with $L=0$ and thus $\\mu_{L}=0$.\n\nHence, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2275675"}]}
