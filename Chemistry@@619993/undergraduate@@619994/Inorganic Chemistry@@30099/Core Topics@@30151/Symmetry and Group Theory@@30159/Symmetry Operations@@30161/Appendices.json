This exercise provides foundational practice by asking you to identify all the principal symmetry operations in a common molecule, *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene.

Consider the *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene molecule (ClHC=CHCl), which is known to be a planar molecule. Its structure consists of two carbon atoms joined by a double bond, with each carbon also bonded to one hydrogen atom and one chlorine atom. The two chlorine atoms are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nFrom the list of symmetry operations provided below, identify all operations that are present in this molecule.

An improper rotation about a four-fold axis of symmetry ($S_4$).", "solution": "To determine the symmetry operations present in planar *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene, we will visualize the molecule and systematically check for the presence of each type of symmetry element corresponding to the operations listed.\n\nLet's place the molecule in a Cartesian coordinate system. We can orient it such that it lies in the $xy$-plane, with the center of the C=C double bond at the origin (0,0,0) and the C=C bond aligned along the $x$-axis. In this configuration, the two carbon atoms are located at approximately $(\\pm a, 0, 0)$. The chlorine and hydrogen atoms are also in the $xy$-plane. Because it is the *trans* isomer, one Cl and one H are attached to the carbon at $(a, 0, 0)$, and the other Cl and H are attached to the carbon at $(-a, 0, 0)$, with the two Cl atoms on opposite sides of the C=C bond. For instance, one Cl might be at a positive $y$ value and the other at a negative $y$ value.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. **A rotation about a two-fold axis of symmetry ($C_2$)**: A $C_2$ operation is a rotation by $180^\\circ$. Let's consider an axis passing through the origin and perpendicular to the molecular plane (the $z$-axis). Rotating the molecule by $180^\\circ$ around the $z$-axis will exchange the positions of the two carbon atoms, the two chlorine atoms, and the two hydrogen atoms. The resulting orientation is indistinguishable from the original. Therefore, a $C_2$ axis exists, and the $C_2$ operation is a valid symmetry operation for the molecule. This makes option A correct. This $C_2$ axis is the principal axis because it is the rotation axis of the highest order.\n\nB. **A reflection through a horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$)**: A horizontal mirror plane, $\\sigma_h$, is defined as a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis of rotation. As established in the previous step, the principal axis is the $C_2$ axis along the $z$-direction. The plane of the molecule itself (the $xy$-plane) is perpendicular to this axis. A reflection through the $xy$-plane leaves all atoms in their original positions since they all lie within this plane. Thus, the molecular plane is a $\\sigma_h$ plane. This makes option B correct.\n\nC. **A reflection through a vertical mirror plane ($\\sigma_v$)**: A vertical mirror plane, $\\sigma_v$, must contain the principal axis (the $C_2$ axis, i.e., the $z$-axis). Consider a potential $\\sigma_v$ plane like the $xz$-plane, which contains the C=C bond. Reflecting the molecule across this plane would move the atom at $(x, y, 0)$ to $(x, -y, 0)$. This would map the chlorine atom on one side of the C=C axis to a location on the other side where there is a hydrogen atom. Since Cl is not H, this is not a symmetry operation. Similarly, the $yz$-plane (perpendicular to the C=C bond) is not a mirror plane. Therefore, the molecule does not possess any vertical mirror planes. This makes option C incorrect.\n\nD. **An inversion through a center of symmetry ($i$)**: A center of inversion, $i$, is a point at the center of the molecule through which every atom can be reflected to an identical atom an equal distance on the opposite side. We placed the center of the C=C bond at the origin (0,0,0). For any atom at coordinates $(x, y, z)$, the inversion operation sends it to $(-x, -y, -z)$. In our setup, the atom at $(x, y, 0)$ is sent to $(-x, -y, 0)$. The carbon at $(a, 0, 0)$ is exchanged with the carbon at $(-a, 0, 0)$. The chlorine atom attached to one carbon is exchanged with the chlorine atom on the other carbon, and similarly for the hydrogen atoms. The molecule is mapped onto itself. Thus, a center of inversion exists at the origin. This makes option D correct.\n\nE. **A rotation about a three-fold axis of symmetry ($C_3$)**: A $C_3$ operation requires the molecule to be indistinguishable after a rotation of $360^\\circ/3 = 120^\\circ$. The geometry of *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene does not have any three-fold symmetry. A $120^\\circ$ rotation would move atoms to positions not occupied by identical atoms. This makes option E incorrect.\n\nF. **An improper rotation about a four-fold axis of symmetry ($S_4$)**: An $S_4$ operation consists of a $90^\\circ$ rotation followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. The molecule does not have four-fold rotational symmetry, so it cannot have an $S_4$ axis. This makes option F incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the symmetry operations present in *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene from the given list are $C_2$, $\\sigma_h$, and $i$.
