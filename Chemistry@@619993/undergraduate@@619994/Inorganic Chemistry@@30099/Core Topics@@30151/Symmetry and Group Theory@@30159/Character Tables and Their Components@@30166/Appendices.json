A character table is not an arbitrary grid of numbers; it is governed by a set of powerful mathematical rules derived from group theory. This first practice introduces one of the most essential of these rules, which connects the total number of symmetry operations in a group (its order, $h$) to the dimensions ($d_i$) of its irreducible representations. Mastering this relationship is the crucial first step in constructing or verifying any character table from scratch [@problem_id:2237926].", "problem": "In the field of materials science, group theory is an indispensable tool for understanding the properties of crystalline solids, such as their vibrational modes and electronic band structures. Imagine a newly synthesized, hypothetical crystal whose atomic arrangement is described by a point group. Through crystallographic analysis, it has been determined that the order of this point group is 8. A detailed examination of the group's multiplication table reveals that its symmetry operations fall into exactly 5 distinct conjugacy classes.\n\nTo construct the complete character table for this group, which is essential for predicting spectroscopic selection rules, one must first determine the dimensions of all its irreducible representations. Using the fundamental principles of group representation theory, determine the dimensions of the five irreducible representations for this hypothetical point group.", "solution": "Let $G$ be the point group with $|G|=8$ and exactly $5$ conjugacy classes. By the fundamental theorems of finite group representation theory:\n\n1) The number of (inequivalent) irreducible representations equals the number of conjugacy classes. Hence $G$ has exactly $5$ irreducible representations. Let their dimensions be $d_{1},d_{2},d_{3},d_{4},d_{5}\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.\n\n2) The sum of the squares of the irreducible representation dimensions equals the order of the group:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5} d_{i}^{2} \\;=\\; |G| \\;=\\; 8.\n$$\n\nWe now classify all possible $5$-tuples of positive integers whose squares sum to $8$. Since $3^{2}=9>8$, every $d_{i}$ must be either $1$ or $2$. If any $d_{i}=2$, it contributes $4$ to the sum; if $d_{i}=1$, it contributes $1$.

This conclusion is consistent with the known non-abelian groups of order $8$ that have $5$ conjugacy classes (such as the dihedral group of order $8$ and the quaternion group), each of which has four one-dimensional irreducible representations and one two-dimensional irreducible representation.\n\nThus, the dimensions of the five irreducible representations are $1,1,1,1,2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2237926"}, {"introduction": "Once the dimensions of the irreducible representations are known, the next challenge is to determine the specific values of the characters themselves.

For the purpose of a simplified symmetry analysis, the molecule is assumed to possess a perfect $D_{4h}$ point group symmetry. The results of a quantum mechanical calculation provide the energies and symmetry properties of the molecular orbitals. Two specific findings near the frontier orbital region are of particular interest:\n\n1.  **Observation 1:** A pair of molecular orbitals, which we can label $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$, are found to be exactly degenerate at an energy $E_1$.

The block-diagonal form of $H$ is\n$$\nH\\big|_{A_{2u}}=\\lambda_{A_{2u}},\\quad H\\big|_{B_{2u}}=\\lambda_{B_{2u}},\n$$\nwith no symmetry constraint relating $\\lambda_{A_{2u}}$ and $\\lambda_{B_{2u}}$. Since they belong to different irreps, the energies can vary independently under any perturbation that preserves $D_{4h}$. Equality $E_{2}=\\lambda_{A_{2u}}=\\lambda_{B_{2u}}$ is therefore not enforced by symmetry and is accidental.\n\nThese conclusions address the distractors:\n- The claim that degeneracy requires gerade parity is false; $E_{u}$ exhibits symmetry-required degeneracy despite ungerade parity.\n- The claim that only cubic groups have symmetry-required degeneracy is false; $D_{4h}$ has two-dimensional $E$-type irreps.\n- The fact that $A_{2u}$ and $B_{2u}$ share the same character under the identity operation is irrelevant; all one-dimensional irreps have character $1$ at the identity, but degeneracy arises within a single irrep and equals its dimension, not from matching identity characters across different irreps.\n\nTherefore, the correct assessment is that the degeneracy in Observation 1 is required by symmetry, while the degeneracy in Observation 2 is accidental.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2237942"}]}
