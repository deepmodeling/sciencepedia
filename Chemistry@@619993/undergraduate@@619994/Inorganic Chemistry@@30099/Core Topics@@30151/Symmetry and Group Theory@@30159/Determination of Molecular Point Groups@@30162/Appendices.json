It serves as a precursor for the synthesis of agrochemicals and other specialty chemicals. To understand its spectroscopic properties and reactivity, a correct assignment of its molecular symmetry is essential.\n\nAssume that the molecule is perfectly planar, with the benzene ring forming a regular hexagon. The two chlorine atoms are substituted on adjacent carbon atoms (positions 1 and 2), and the carbon-chlorine and carbon-hydrogen bonds all lie in the plane of the ring.\n\nBased on this idealized geometry, determine the Schoenflies symbol representing the point group of the 1,2-dichlorobenzene molecule.\n\nA. $C_{s}$\n\nB. $C_{2v}$\n\nC. $C_{2h}$\n\nD. $D_{2h}$\n\nE. $D_{6h}$", "solution": "We idealize 1,2-dichlorobenzene as a perfectly planar regular hexagon with two identical substituents (Cl) at adjacent ring positions (1 and 2), the remaining four positions bearing H. All atoms lie in the same plane.\n\nBy the definition of a planar molecule, reflection through the molecular plane is a symmetry operation; thus there is at least one mirror plane. However, to classify the point group we must first identify the highest-order proper rotation axis present.\n\nTest a $C_{2}$ axis perpendicular to the ring plane (through the center): a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about this axis maps position $1 \\to 4$ and $2 \\to 5$, which would interchange Cl with H; hence this operation is not a symmetry. Therefore, no $C_{n}$ axis perpendicular to the plane survives.\n\nNow test $C_{2}$ axes lying in the plane of the ring. In the regular hexagon there are three such axes. The axis that passes through the midpoints of the $1$–$2$ and $4$–$5$ bonds effects the mapping $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$, $3 \\leftrightarrow 6$, and $4 \\leftrightarrow 5$. Because $1$ and $2$ are both Cl and the other mapped pairs are both H, this $C_{2}$ operation is a valid symmetry. The other in-plane $C_{2}$ axes would send a Cl to an H site and thus are not symmetries. Hence there is exactly one $C_{2}$ axis, which we take as the principal axis.\n\nWith that principal $C_{2}$ axis chosen, we identify mirror planes containing it. The molecular plane itself contains this axis, so it is one vertical mirror plane, call it $\\sigma_{v1}$. In addition, the plane perpendicular to the molecular plane that contains the same line (equivalently, reflection in the molecular plane about the line bisecting the $1$–$2$ and $4$–$5$ bonds) is also a mirror plane, $\\sigma_{v2}$, since it maps $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$, $3 \\leftrightarrow 6$, and $4 \\leftrightarrow 5$.\n\nThere is no inversion center (since inversion would map $1 \\to 4$ and $2 \\to 5$, mixing Cl and H), so $C_{2h}$ and $D_{2h}$ are excluded. There is only one $C_{2}$ axis, so $D$ groups are excluded. More than one mirror plane is present, so $C_{s}$ is excluded.

The Re–Re bond is a unique molecular axis along which a rotation by $90^{\\circ}$ maps each Cl to an equivalent Cl position within each square and preserves the eclipsed alignment. Therefore, there is a $C_{4}$ principal axis along the Re–Re bond.\n\nStep 2: Check for a center of inversion. The midpoint of the Re–Re bond maps each Re atom to the other and each top Cl to the corresponding bottom Cl due to the eclipsed alignment. Hence, there is an inversion center $i$ at the bond midpoint.\n\nStep 3: Check for a horizontal mirror plane. The plane perpendicular to the Re–Re axis at its midpoint reflects the top square into the bottom square with perfect superposition (because of the eclipsed arrangement). Thus, there is a horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_{h}$ perpendicular to the $C_{4}$ axis.\n\nStep 4: Check for $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to the principal axis. Through the Re–Re midpoint, there are four mutually perpendicular directions in the equatorial plane: two pass through pairs of aligned Cl atoms (along the Cartesian $x$ and $y$ directions defined by the squares), and two bisect the angles between those directions. A $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about any of these axes interchanges the two Re atoms and maps each Cl to an equivalent aligned Cl position. Therefore, there are four $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $C_{4}$, consistent with a dihedral set in a $D$-type group with $n=4$.\n\nStep 5: Check for vertical mirror planes. Because the squares are eclipsed, there are mirror planes containing the Re–Re axis that either pass through pairs of aligned Cl atoms (giving $\\sigma_{v}$ planes) or bisect the angles between those directions (giving $\\sigma_{d}$ planes). Both types are present as required in $D_{4h}$.\n\nStep 6: Group assignment.
