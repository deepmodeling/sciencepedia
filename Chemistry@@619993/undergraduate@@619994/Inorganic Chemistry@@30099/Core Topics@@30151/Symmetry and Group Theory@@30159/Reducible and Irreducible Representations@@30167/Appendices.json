To analyze its molecular motions, a basis set is constructed from the set of Cartesian displacement vectors $(x, y, z)$ centered on each of the three oxygen atoms.

Atoms permuted to other atoms contribute zero.\n\nLet $\\chi$ denote the character for each class operation of the $D_{3h}$ point group in the standard order $E, 2C_{3}, 3C_{2}, \\sigma_{h}, 2S_{3}, 3\\sigma_{v}$.\n\n- $E$: All three oxygens are fixed. For a fixed atom under $E$, the transformation matrix is the identity, $D(E)=I_{3}$, so its trace is $\\mathrm{tr}(I_{3})=3$. Hence $\\chi(E)=3\\times 3=9$.\n\n- $2C_{3}$: A $C_{3}$ rotation by $120^{\\circ}$ cycles the three oxygens; no oxygen remains at its original site. Hence $\\chi(C_{3})=0$.\n\n- $3C_{2}$: Each $C_{2}$ axis (in-plane) leaves one oxygen (lying on the axis) fixed and swaps the other two.

Reflection in the horizontal plane leaves $x$ and $y$ unchanged and sends $z \\mapsto -z$, so the trace per fixed atom is $1+1-1=1$. Thus $\\chi(\\sigma_{h})=3\\times 1=3$.\n\n- $2S_{3}$: An $S_{3}$ operation is $\\sigma_{h}C_{3}$. The $C_{3}$ part permutes the oxygens with no fixed atom, and $\\sigma_{h}$ does not change that. Hence $\\chi(S_{3})=0$.\n\n- $3\\sigma_{v}$: Each vertical mirror plane contains the $C_{3}$ axis and one Câ€“O bond, fixing exactly one oxygen and swapping the other two. Reflection in a vertical plane leaves the two components in the plane unchanged and inverts the component perpendicular to the plane, so the trace per fixed atom is $1+1-1=1$.
