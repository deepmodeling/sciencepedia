They are a powerful tool for predicting the shapes of small molecules.\n\nConsider a generic triatomic molecule of the type $\\text{AH}_2$, where A is a central atom and H are terminal hydrogen atoms.

The key principles from the Walsh diagram for an $\\text{AH}_2$ molecule, describing the energy changes as the H-A-H bond angle decreases from 180° (linear) to 90° (bent), are as follows:\n\n1.  In the linear ($D_{\\infty h}$ symmetry) configuration, the valence MOs, in order of increasing energy, are a bonding $\\sigma_g$ orbital, a bonding $\\sigma_u$ orbital, and a pair of degenerate non-bonding p-type orbitals on the central atom, designated as $\\pi_u$.\n2.  As the molecule bends (to $C_{2v}$ symmetry), the degeneracy of the $\\pi_u$ orbitals is lifted. One of these orbitals, which points into the H-A-H bond angle, is significantly stabilized by mixing with other orbitals of the same symmetry and is relabeled as an $a_1$ orbital.\n3.

Consider a simplified model based on the following principles:\n\n1.  In a linear geometry (180°), the valence molecular orbitals derived from the central atom's p-orbitals include a degenerate pair of non-bonding orbitals, designated $1\\pi_u$.\n2.  When the molecule bends (angle < 180°), this degeneracy is lifted. One of these orbitals, labeled $1b_1$, remains largely non-bonding and its energy is insensitive to the angle. The other orbital, labeled $3a_1$, lies in the plane of the three atoms and can interact with other orbitals of the same symmetry. This interaction causes the energy of the $3a_1$ orbital to decrease significantly as the bond angle decreases from 180°.\n3.  The stability of the molecule is maximized at the bond angle that results in the lowest total electronic energy. Therefore, occupation of the $3a_1$ orbital provides a strong driving force for the molecule to adopt a bent geometry. Other valence orbitals show much weaker or opposing dependencies on the bond angle.\n\nBased on these principles, predict the order of increasing H-A-H bond angle for the series of gas-phase species: $\\text{LiH}_2^-$, $\\text{BH}_2$, and $\\text{CH}_2^+$. For this problem, consider only valence electrons and assume that the electronegativity of the central atom increases in the order Li < B < C.

Occupation of $3a_{1}$ thus stabilizes bent geometries.\n- Increasing electronegativity of the central atom increases the $s$–$p$ separation $\\Delta_{sp}$, weakening the angle-dependent stabilizing interaction of $3a_{1}$; hence for the same electron occupation, a more electronegative central atom yields a larger equilibrium angle (closer to linear).\n\nStep 1: Determine valence electron counts (considering only valence electrons, as instructed):\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{LiH}_{2}^{-}:&\\quad N_{\\text{val}}=1\\ (\\text{Li})+2\\ (\\text{two H})+1\\ (\\text{charge})=4,\\\\\n\\text{BH}_{2}:&\\quad N_{\\text{val}}=3\\ (\\text{B})+2\\ (\\text{two H})=5,\\\\\n\\text{CH}_{2}^{+}:&\\quad N_{\\text{val}}=4\\ (\\text{C})+2\\ (\\text{two H})-1\\ (\\text{charge})=5.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Identify occupation of the $1\\pi_{u}$-derived pair upon bending.\n- For $N_{\\text{val}}=4$ (isoelectronic with $\\text{BeH}_2$), the $\\pi$-derived pair is empty; the stabilizing $3a_{1}$ is unoccupied.

While the Walsh diagram is highly effective for many main-group molecules, certain cases present exceptions that reveal deeper chemical principles [@problem_id:2298759]. By examining the unexpectedly bent structure of calcium fluoride ($\\text{CaF}_2$), a molecule with 16 valence electrons, you will learn why the simple model based only on $s$ and $p$ orbitals can fail and discover the crucial role that $d$-orbitals can play in determining the geometry of molecules containing heavier elements.", "problem": "The geometry of triatomic molecules can often be predicted using a simple Walsh diagram, which plots the energies of molecular orbitals as a function of the bond angle. For a generic main-group molecule of the type $\\text{AX}_2$, where X is a hydrogen-like atom with only s-orbitals available for bonding, the diagram predicts that species with 16 valence electrons should adopt a linear geometry. However, experimental evidence shows that calcium fluoride ($\\text{CaF}_2$), which has 16 valence electrons (2 from Ca, 7 from each F), is a bent molecule in the gas phase with a F-Ca-F bond angle of approximately 145 degrees. This indicates a failure of the simple Walsh diagram model for this case.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental electronic reason for this discrepancy?\n\nA. The large radius of the calcium cation relative to the fluoride anions results in significant steric repulsion between the non-bonding electrons on the fluorine atoms, forcing the molecule to bend to minimize this repulsion.\n\nB. The energetic accessibility of the 3d orbitals on the calcium atom allows for their participation in bonding. One of the molecular orbitals derived from these d-orbitals is significantly stabilized upon bending, lowering the total electronic energy of the bent conformer relative to the linear one.\n\nC. Strong pi-bonding involving the calcium 4p orbitals and the fluorine 2p orbitals can only occur in a bent geometry, providing the driving force for distortion from linearity.\n\nD. The high polarity of the Ca-F bonds leads to a significant accumulation of negative charge on the fluorine atoms. This charge concentration destabilizes the linear geometry through electrostatic repulsion, favoring a bent structure.\n\nE. The second ionization energy of calcium is unusually high, leading to a more covalent character in the Ca-F bonds than expected. This increased covalency alters the orbital energy levels in a way that is not captured by the simple ionic model implicit in the Walsh diagram.", "solution": "The Walsh-diagram prediction for a linear geometry in an $\\text{AX}_2$ species with 16 valence electrons relies on a simplified orbital model with two key assumptions:\n- Only the central atom’s $ns$ and $np$ valence orbitals are considered for bonding.\n- Each ligand X is “hydrogen-like,” contributing only an $s$-type orbital to the ligand group orbitals.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the orbital energy ordering as a function of the X–A–X angle favors the linear limit for 16 electrons. Crucially, this model excludes low-lying $d$ orbitals on the central atom and any ligand $p$-based interactions beyond simple $\\sigma$-type $s$-donor behavior.\n\nFor $\\text{CaF}_2$, both assumptions break down in a way that fundamentally alters the Walsh trend:\n- Calcium (Period 4) has energetically accessible 3$d$ orbitals relative to its 4$s$ and 4$p$ valence set.\n- Fluoride is not hydrogen-like; it brings $2p$ orbitals that form strong $\\sigma$ interactions and create ligand group orbitals of various symmetries.\n\nThe key electronic effect is that bending from the linear geometry (with $D_{\\infty h}$ symmetry) to a bent geometry (with $C_{2v}$ symmetry) enables additional symmetry-allowed mixing between the central Ca 3$d$ orbitals and the ligand group orbitals. In $C_{2v}$, orbitals of $a_{1}$, $b_{1}$, and $b_{2}$ symmetry on Ca (notably $3d_{z^{2}}$, $3d_{xz}$, $3d_{yz}$) can mix with the corresponding ligand combinations and the Ca $4s$ and $4p$ orbitals, stabilizing certain occupied molecular orbitals upon bending. This effect is a textbook instance of second-order Jahn–Teller (or pseudo–Jahn–Teller) stabilization: when bending introduces a vibronic coupling $H'$ that mixes filled and low-lying empty orbitals of the same symmetry, the energy is lowered by\n$$\n\\Delta E \\approx -\\sum_{\\text{coupled pairs}} \\frac{|\\langle \\psi_{\\text{filled}}|H'|\\psi_{\\text{empty}}\\rangle|^{2}}{\\Delta \\epsilon},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\epsilon$ is the energy gap between the interacting orbitals. Because the Ca 3d levels are relatively low in energy (small $\\Delta \\epsilon$) and symmetry-allowed mixing grows upon bending, the stabilization can be substantial, overcoming the linear preference predicted by the $s$/$p$-only Walsh model.\n\nEvaluating the options in light of this:\n- A: Steric or lone-pair repulsion on fluorine is not the fundamental driver; purely electrostatic or steric arguments would more likely favor larger F–F separation (hence linear), not bending.\n- B: The low-lying Ca 3d orbitals participate in bonding and are significantly stabilized upon bending through symmetry-allowed mixing, providing a clear, fundamental electronic reason for the bent geometry. This directly explains the failure of the $s$/$p$-only Walsh diagram.\n- C: Strong $\\pi$ bonding involving Ca $4p$ orbitals and F 2$p$ orbitals is not the dominant effect; Ca $4p$ orbitals are higher in energy and $\\pi$ interactions do not uniquely require a bent geometry.\n- D: Increased polarity alone would not generally destabilize the linear geometry; electrostatic repulsion between fluorides would, if anything, favor maximizing separation (i.e., linear), not bending.\n- E: The second ionization energy of Ca is not the pertinent factor here; the critical missing ingredient in the simple model is the explicit inclusion and mixing of Ca 3d orbitals, not an adjustment to covalency inferred from ionization energies.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental electronic reason for the discrepancy is the energetic accessibility and symmetry-enabled participation of Ca 3d orbitals, which are stabilized upon bending.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2298759"}]}
