Assume the complex adopts the standard coordination geometry for its coordination number.", "solution": "The complex is written as $[Ru(NH_3)_6]Cl_3$. Each $NH_3$ is a neutral ligand, and the three $Cl^-$ serve as counterions; therefore the coordination entity is $[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$. Hence the oxidation state of ruthenium in the complex is $+3$.\n\nRuthenium has atomic number $44$ with a ground-state configuration approximated by $[\\text{Kr}]4d^7 5s^1$. Forming $Ru^{3+}$ removes first the $5s$ electron and then two $4d$ electrons, giving a $4d^5$ configuration. Thus the metal center is a $d^5$ ion.\n\nThe coordination number is $6$, and the standard geometry for such ammine complexes is octahedral. In an octahedral crystal field, the $d$ orbitals split into lower-energy $t_{2g}$ and higher-energy $e_g$ sets with splitting $\\Delta_o$. For second-row transition metals (4d series), $\\Delta_o$ is relatively large and the pairing energy is relatively small, so octahedral complexes are typically low spin even with intermediate-to-strong field ligands such as $NH_3$. Therefore, for $d^5$ in a low-spin octahedral field, all five electrons occupy the $t_{2g}$ set before any enter $e_g$, yielding the configuration $t_{2g}^5 e_g^0$.\n\nFilling $t_{2g}$ with five electrons gives the occupancy pattern $(2,2,1)$ across the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals, which contains exactly one unpaired electron.

You have access to aqueous solutions of ammonia ($NH_3$) and sodium nitrite ($NaNO_2$) as your reagents. The synthesis relies on controlling the sequence of ligand substitution reactions. The ability of a coordinated ligand to direct an incoming substituent to the position *trans* (opposite) to itself is known as the *trans* effect.

By the given trans-effect series, $Cl^-$ exerts a stronger trans effect than $NH_3$. Therefore, in the next substitution, the chloride trans to $Cl^-$ is the most labile and will be replaced; the entering $NO_2^-$ will then occupy the position trans to that $Cl^-$ (the strongest trans director present), not trans to $NH_3$.

In the next substitution by $NH_3$, the chloride trans to $NO_2^-$ leaves fastest, and the entering $NH_3$ takes the site trans to $NO_2^-$, yielding *trans*-$[PtCl_2(NO_2)(NH_3)]^-$, not the desired cis product.\n- Option C (simultaneous reagents): Competing pathways give mixtures; the presence of $NO_2^-$ early will tend to direct $NH_3$ trans to $NO_2^-$, favoring significant trans product. This is not a selective route to the cis isomer.\n- Option D (two $NO_2^-$ first): Two substitutions give $[PtCl_2(NO_2)_2]^{2-}$. Adding one equivalent of $NH_3$ next yields $[PtCl(NO_2)_2(NH_3)]^-$ by replacing a chloride trans to $NO_2^-$. This does not have the target stoichiometry (it has only one chloride), so it cannot produce $[PtCl_2(NO_2)(NH_3)]^-$.\n- Option E is false: cis isomers of $Pt(II)$ complexes (e.g., cisplatin) are routinely synthesized selectively via trans-effect control.\n\nTherefore, the sequence that selectively yields *cis*-$[PtCl_2(NO_2)(NH_3)]^-$ as the major product is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2241433"}]}
