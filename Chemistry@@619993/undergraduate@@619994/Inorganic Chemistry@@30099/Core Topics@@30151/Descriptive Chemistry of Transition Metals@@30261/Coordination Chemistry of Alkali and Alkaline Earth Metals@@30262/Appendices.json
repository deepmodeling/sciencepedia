They are typically prepared by reacting an organic halide with magnesium metal in an ethereal solvent. The solvent molecules, which are Lewis bases, play a crucial role in stabilizing the highly reactive organomagnesium species.\n\nConsider a common scenario where a monomeric Grignard reagent, with the general formula $RMgX$ (where $R$ is an alkyl group and $X$ is a halogen), is stabilized in solution by coordinating to two molecules of diethyl ether ($OEt_2$). The resulting solvated complex can be represented by the formula $RMgX(OEt_2)_2$. In this complex, the magnesium atom is the central metal ion. It forms a direct covalent bond with the carbon atom of the alkyl group $R$ and a direct bond with the halogen atom $X$.

To determine the coordination number of magnesium (Mg) in the complex $RMgX(OEt_2)_2$, we must identify all the ligands and count the number of atoms from these ligands that are directly attached to the Mg atom.\n\nFirst, we identify the central atom, which is specified as magnesium (Mg).\n\nNext, we identify the ligands, which are the molecules or ions bonded to the central Mg atom. Based on the problem description and the formula $RMgX(OEt_2)_2$, the ligands are:\n1.  The alkyl group, $R$.\n2.  The halogen atom, $X$.\n3.

This is also known as the denticity of the ligand.\n\n1.  The alkyl group ($R$): The problem states that the magnesium atom forms a direct covalent bond with the carbon atom of the alkyl group. This means the alkyl group acts as a monodentate ligand, donating one electron pair from its carbon atom. It contributes 1 to the coordination number.\n\n2.  The halogen atom ($X$): The problem states that there is a direct bond between the magnesium atom and the halogen atom. The halogen atom, therefore, acts as a monodentate ligand. It contributes 1 to the coordination number.\n\n3.  The two diethyl ether molecules ($OEt_2$): The problem states that each diethyl ether molecule coordinates to the magnesium center through its single oxygen atom. The oxygen atom has lone pairs that it can donate to the Lewis acidic magnesium center. Since each ether molecule uses one oxygen atom to bind to Mg, each ether molecule is a monodentate ligand. As there are two diethyl ether molecules, they collectively contribute $2 \\times 1 = 2$ to the coordination number.\n\nFinally, we sum the contributions from all ligands to find the total coordination number of the magnesium atom:\nCoordination Number = (Contribution from $R$) + (Contribution from $X$) + (Contribution from two $OEt_2$ molecules)\nCoordination Number = $1 + 1 + 2 = 4$.\n\nThe coordination number of the magnesium atom in the complex $RMgX(OEt_2)_2$ is 4.

This is essential for practical applications, from industrial processes to biological systems. This problem challenges you to compare the stabilities of EDTA complexes with two different alkaline earth metal ions, $Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$. The key principle at play is the charge density of the cation and its influence on the strength of electrostatic interactions with the ligand, providing a powerful predictive tool rooted in periodic trends [@problem_id:2240879].", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, the stability of a complex in solution is quantified by its formation constant, $K_f$. A common chelating agent used to sequester metal ions is the anion of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which is a hexadentate ligand. Consider a solution containing both magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$) and strontium ($Sr^{2+}$) ions. Both ions are alkaline earth metals and form 1:1 octahedral complexes with the EDTA anion ($[EDTA]^{4-}$), resulting in complex ions with a charge of 2-, namely $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ and $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles governing the stability of coordination complexes, which of the following statements correctly compares the formation constants for these two complexes and provides the most accurate chemical reasoning?\n\nA. The formation constant for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ because the larger ionic radius of $Sr^{2+}$ provides a better steric fit for the large EDTA ligand.\n\nB. The formation constant for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$ because $Mg^{2+}$ has a higher charge density, leading to stronger electrostatic interactions with the ligand's donor atoms.\n\nC. The formation constant for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ because Strontium is more polarizable, which enhances covalent bonding character with the EDTA ligand.\n\nD. The formation constants are approximately equal because both $Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$ are in the same group, have the same +2 charge, and EDTA is a strong, non-selective chelating agent.\n\nE. The formation constant for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$ because Magnesium is more electronegative than Strontium.", "solution": "The problem asks us to compare the stability, as measured by the formation constant ($K_f$), of the EDTA complexes of $Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$. The formation of these complexes can be represented by the equilibrium reaction:\n$$M^{2+}(aq) + [EDTA]^{4-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons [M(EDTA)]^{2-}(aq)$$\nwhere M can be either Mg or Sr.\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is given by:\n$$K_f = \\frac{[[M(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[M^{2+}][ [EDTA]^{4-} ]}$$\nA larger value of $K_f$ indicates a more stable complex, meaning the equilibrium lies further to the right, favoring the formation of the complex ion.\n\nThe stability of coordination complexes formed by metal ions with a given ligand is influenced by several factors. When comparing ions within the same group of the periodic table, such as the alkaline earth metals ($Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$), the ions have the same charge (+2). Therefore, the primary factor determining the stability of their complexes with a hard Lewis base ligand like EDTA (which has oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms) is the charge density of the cation.\n\nCharge density is defined as the ratio of an ion's charge to its size (ionic radius or volume).\n$$ \\text{Charge Density} \\propto \\frac{\\text{Charge}}{\\text{Ionic Radius}} $$\n\nLet's compare the ionic radii of $Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$. Both magnesium and strontium are in Group 2 of the periodic table. Ionic radius increases as one moves down a group because additional electron shells are added. Magnesium is in Period 3, while Strontium is in Period 5. Therefore, the ionic radius of $Sr^{2+}$ is significantly larger than that of $Mg^{2+}$.\n$$ r_{Mg^{2+}} < r_{Sr^{2+}} $$\n\nSince both ions have the same charge ($+2$), the ion with the smaller radius will have the higher charge density. Consequently, $Mg^{2+}$ has a higher charge density than $Sr^{2+}$.\n\nA higher charge density on the central metal cation leads to a stronger electrostatic attraction to the electron-donating atoms of the ligand. In this case, the positively charged $Mg^{2+}$ ion will more strongly attract the negatively charged carboxylate groups and the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms of the EDTA ligand compared to the less charge-dense $Sr^{2+}$ ion. This stronger electrostatic interaction results in a more stable metal-ligand bond.\n\nA more stable bond corresponds to a more stable complex, which in turn is reflected by a larger formation constant, $K_f$. Therefore, the formation constant for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than that for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$.\n$$ K_f([Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}) > K_f([Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}) $$\nThis reasoning directly matches the statement in option B.\n\nLet's analyze the other options to see why they are incorrect:\n- **Option A:** This suggests a \"best fit\" or \"lock-and-key\" model where the larger $Sr^{2+}$ ion fits better into the EDTA 'cavity'. While steric factors can be important, for ions of this type with a flexible ligand like EDTA, the electrostatic interaction (charge density) is the dominant factor. The idea of a rigid cavity with an optimal size is an oversimplification and incorrect in this context.\n- **Option C:** While polarizability increases down a group ($Sr^{2+}$ is more polarizable than $Mg^{2+}$), this factor is more significant for interactions with soft ligands (due to increased covalent character). EDTA, with its N and O donors, is considered a hard ligand, making the interaction primarily electrostatic. Therefore, charge density is the dominant principle, not polarizability.\n- **Option D:** This option incorrectly assumes that because the ions are in the same group and have the same charge, their complex stability will be the same. This ignores the significant effect of the differing ionic radii and resulting charge densities.\n- **Option E:** While it correctly concludes that the Mg complex is more stable, it provides the wrong reason. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a covalent bond. While related to electrostatic attraction, charge density is the more direct and appropriate concept for explaining the bond strength in these predominantly ionic/electrostatic coordination complexes. The higher charge density of $Mg^{2+}$ is the most precise explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2240879"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative predictions to quantitative analysis allows for a deeper understanding of coordination equilibria.
