Potassium tris(oxalato)chromate(III)", "solution": "We analyze the coordination compound $K_{3}[Cr(C_{2}O_{4})_{3}]$ following IUPAC rules.\n\nFirst, determine the oxidation state of the central metal. Let the oxidation state of chromium be $x$. Each oxalate ligand is $C_{2}O_{4}^{2-}$ with charge $-2$. There are three oxalate ligands, contributing a total charge of $3 \\times (-2) = -6$. The complex ion must have a charge of $-3$ to balance three $K^{+}$ ions. Therefore,\n$$\nx + 3(-2) = -3 \\implies x - 6 = -3 \\implies x = +3.\n$$\nThus, the metal is in the $+3$ oxidation state.\n\nNext, name the ligands and the metal within the complex. The ligand $C_{2}O_{4}^{2-}$ is named oxalato. Since there are three identical oxalato ligands and oxalato is a polydentate ligand, the appropriate multiplicative prefix is “tris” with the ligand name placed in parentheses: tris(oxalato).\n\nBecause the complex ion is anionic, the metal name takes the “-ate” ending; for chromium, the anionic form is chromate. The oxidation state is indicated in Roman numerals in parentheses: chromate(III).\n\nFor salts, name the cation first and the anionic complex second. Therefore, the full name is: potassium tris(oxalato)chromate(III).\n\nComparing with the options:\n- A is not preferred IUPAC usage for a polydentate ligand (should be tris(oxalato), not trioxalato).\n- B places “potassium” incorrectly within the complex name.\n- C incorrectly uses “chromium” instead of “chromate” for an anionic complex.\n- D gives the wrong oxidation state.\n- E exactly matches the IUPAC name derived: Potassium tris(oxalato)chromate(III).\n\nHence, the correct option is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2262502"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond a complex's name, we delve into its electronic structure, which governs its physical and chemical properties.

This exercise explores the classic example of a cobalt(II) solution changing from pink to blue, challenging you to connect theory with observation. You will apply concepts like ligand exchange, coordination geometry, and ligand field theory to explain how the electronic structure and, consequently, the color of a complex can be altered by changing its chemical environment [@problem_id:2262489].", "problem": "An inorganic chemist prepares a dilute aqueous solution of cobalt(II) chloride, $CoCl_2$. The resulting solution has a characteristic pink color. To this solution, the chemist adds a large volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid, $HCl$. A rapid and dramatic color change is observed, with the final solution appearing deep blue.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for this chemical transformation and the associated color change?\n\nA. The added chloride ions act as a reducing agent, converting the cobalt(II) center to cobalt(I). The resulting Co(I) complex has a different geometry and absorbs light at a different wavelength, causing the blue color.\n\nB. The coordination sphere of the cobalt(II) ion changes, leading to a new complex with a tetrahedral geometry. This change from an octahedral to a tetrahedral field significantly increases the d-orbital splitting energy, causing the absorption maximum to shift to higher energy and the solution to appear blue.\n\nC. The water ligands in the coordination sphere of the cobalt(II) ion are replaced by chloride ions, but the complex maintains its original octahedral geometry. The color change occurs because chloride is a much stronger-field ligand than water, which increases the d-orbital splitting energy.\n\nD. The coordination number of the cobalt(II) ion changes from six to four as water ligands are replaced by chloride ions, resulting in a change from an octahedral to a tetrahedral geometry. This combination of a weaker-field ligand and a change in geometry leads to a smaller d-orbital splitting energy, causing the complex to absorb lower-energy light and thus appear blue.\n\nE. The cobalt(II) ion undergoes a ligand exchange reaction, replacing its coordinated water molecules with chloride ions to form a tetrahedral complex. This new complex is blue because it strongly absorbs light in the blue region of the visible spectrum.", "solution": "The phenomenon described involves a ligand exchange reaction around a cobalt(II) metal center, leading to a change in its coordination environment and, consequently, its color. We must analyze the initial and final states of the cobalt complex to understand the transformation.\n\nStep 1: Identify the initial species and its properties.\nIn a dilute aqueous solution, cobalt(II) ions are hydrated by water molecules. The typical coordination number for $Co^{2+}$ with small ligands like water is six, forming an octahedral complex. Therefore, the pink species is the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion, $[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$. The chloride ions from the dissolved $CoCl_2$ are initially present as counter-ions in the solution. The color of transition metal complexes is due to d-d electronic transitions. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap between d-orbitals, known as the ligand field splitting energy, $\\Delta$. The observed color is the complement of the color of the absorbed light. A pink or red solution absorbs light in the green region of the visible spectrum. Thus, the octahedral complex $[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ has a ligand field splitting energy, $\\Delta_o$, that corresponds to the energy of green light.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of adding concentrated HCl.\nConcentrated hydrochloric acid provides a very high concentration of chloride ions ($Cl^-$). According to Le Châtelier's principle, this high concentration of $Cl^-$ drives a ligand exchange reaction, where the water ligands are displaced by chloride ligands.\n\nStep 3: Determine the final species and its properties.\nChloride is a larger ligand than water. Steric hindrance between the larger chloride ligands favors a lower coordination number. For $Co^{2+}$, the substitution with chloride ions results in a change of coordination number from six to four, forming the tetrahedral tetrachloridocobaltate(II) ion, $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$. The equilibrium can be written as:\n$$[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+} (\\text{pink, octahedral}) + 4 Cl^{-} \\rightleftharpoons [CoCl_4]^{2-} (\\text{blue, tetrahedral}) + 6 H_2O$$\nThe problem states the final solution is deep blue. A blue solution absorbs light in the complementary color region, which is orange-yellow.\n\nStep 4: Relate the color change to the change in splitting energy.\nThe initial pink complex absorbs green light. The final blue complex absorbs orange-yellow light. In the visible spectrum, green light has a shorter wavelength and thus higher energy than orange-yellow light. This means that the ligand field splitting energy of the initial complex is greater than that of the final complex: $\\Delta_{\\text{initial}} > \\Delta_{\\text{final}}$. Specifically, the splitting energy for the octahedral aquo complex is greater than that for the tetrahedral chloro complex: $\\Delta_o([Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}) > \\Delta_t([CoCl_4]^{2-})$.\n\nStep 5: Explain the decrease in splitting energy.\nThere are two contributing factors to this decrease in $\\Delta$:\n1.  **Change in Geometry:** The ligand field splitting in a tetrahedral geometry ($\\Delta_t$) is inherently smaller than in an octahedral geometry ($\\Delta_o$) for the same metal and ligands. The theoretical relationship is $\\Delta_t \\approx \\frac{4}{9} \\Delta_o$.\n2.  **Change in Ligand Identity:** The spectrochemical series ranks ligands based on their ability to cause d-orbital splitting. Water ($H_2O$) is a stronger-field ligand than chloride ($Cl^{-}$), meaning that for a given geometry, water would produce a larger $\\Delta$ than chloride.\n\nBoth the change from octahedral to tetrahedral geometry and the change from a stronger-field ligand ($H_2O$) to a weaker-field ligand ($Cl^-$) work in concert to significantly decrease the ligand field splitting energy. This decrease shifts the absorption peak from higher-energy green light to lower-energy orange-yellow light, causing the observed color to change from pink to blue.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options.\n- A is incorrect. $HCl$ is an acid, not a reducing agent in this context. The oxidation state of cobalt remains +2.\n- B is incorrect. It correctly identifies the geometry change but incorrectly states that it *increases* the splitting energy. A change from octahedral to tetrahedral geometry decreases the splitting energy.\n- C is incorrect. The geometry does not remain octahedral. Furthermore, it incorrectly identifies chloride as a stronger-field ligand than water.\n- D is correct. It accurately describes the change in coordination number (6 to 4), the geometry change (octahedral to tetrahedral), the relative ligand field strengths (water > chloride), and correctly concludes that these factors lead to a smaller splitting energy ($\\Delta$), which results in the absorption of lower-energy light, causing the observed color change.\n- E is incorrect. It correctly identifies the product but misunderstands the relationship between observed and absorbed color. A blue object does not absorb blue light; it absorbs orange light and reflects/transmits blue light.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2262489"}]}
