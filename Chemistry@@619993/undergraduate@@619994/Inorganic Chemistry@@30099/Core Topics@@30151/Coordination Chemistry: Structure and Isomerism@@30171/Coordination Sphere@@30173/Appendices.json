This question moves us from describing complexes to explaining their structure, a key step toward deeper chemical intuition. This final exercise explores the principles governing coordination geometry by examining a well-known chemical transformation, prompting you to analyze the interplay between electronic effects and the physical size of ligands to understand why a change in coordination environment occurs [@problem_id:2241984].", "problem": "The characteristic pink color of aqueous cobalt(II) solutions is due to the presence of the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion, $[\\text{Co}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$. Upon addition of a concentrated solution of chloride ions, a striking color change to deep blue is observed, indicating the formation of the tetrachloridocobaltate(II) ion, $[\\text{CoCl}_4]^{2-}$. This transformation involves a change in both the coordination number and the geometry of the complex.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the primary reason for the observed change from the octahedral geometry of $[\\text{Co}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$ to the tetrahedral geometry of $[\\text{CoCl}_4]^{2-}$?\n\nA. The cobalt center is oxidized from Co(II) to Co(III), and the resulting d-electron count favors a tetrahedral arrangement.\n\nB. The chloride ligand is a much stronger-field ligand than the water ligand, which forces a spin-state change that is only stable in a tetrahedral geometry.\n\nC. The overall charge of the complex changes from cationic ($+2$) to anionic ($-2$), and anionic complexes inherently favor a tetrahedral geometry over an octahedral one.\n\nD. The chloride ligands are significantly larger than the water ligands, leading to substantial steric repulsion that favors the lower coordination number and more open arrangement of a tetrahedral geometry.\n\nE. The reaction is driven by the release of six water molecules, an entropically favorable process that is maximized when the resulting complex has the lowest possible coordination number, which is four.", "solution": "The cobalt center remains in the +2 oxidation state throughout, so option A is invalid. The spectrochemical series places chloride as a weaker-field ligand than water, so option B is incorrect; moreover, tetrahedral fields are intrinsically weaker, and there is no forced spin-state change unique to tetrahedral geometry here. Anionic charge does not inherently impose tetrahedral geometry, as many anionic complexes are octahedral (e.g., hexacyanoferrate), so option C is not a primary reason. Releasing water increases entropy, but entropy alone does not mandate a four-coordinate product nor does it specifically select tetrahedral geometry; thus option E misattributes the driving force.\n\nTo formalize the ligand field argument, consider Co(II) as $d^7$. In an octahedral weak field (appropriate for $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$), the high-spin configuration is $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$, giving\n$$\n\\text{CFSE}_{\\text{oct}} = 5\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) + 2\\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) = -\\frac{4}{5}\\Delta_{o},\n$$\nwith two pairing energies. In a tetrahedral field (appropriate for $\\text{Cl}^-$), the high-spin configuration is $e^4t_2^3$, giving\n$$\n\\text{CFSE}_{\\text{tet}} = 4\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{t}\\right) + 3\\left(+\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{t}\\right) = -\\frac{6}{5}\\Delta_{t},\n$$\nalso with two pairing energies. Using the standard relation $\\Delta_{t} \\approx \\frac{4}{9}\\Delta_{o}$ for the same metal-ligand pair and noting that $\\text{Cl}^-$ is a weaker-field ligand than $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, one finds that the ligand-field stabilization does not favor tetrahedral over octahedral; if anything, octahedral with $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ has the larger magnitude CFSE. Therefore, the primary factor causing the shift from octahedral $[\\text{Co}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$ to tetrahedral $[\\text{CoCl}_4]^{2-}$ is not increased field strength or LFSE, nor the complex charge or entropy alone.\n\nThe decisive factor is sterics: chloride ligands are significantly larger than water molecules. Increased ligand-ligand repulsion for six bulky chloride ligands disfavors octahedral coordination, and a lower coordination number with a more open arrangement (tetrahedral, four-coordinate) minimizes steric crowding. This well-known steric effect explains why $d^7$ Co(II) commonly forms tetrahedral complexes with halides, while it forms octahedral complexes with smaller ligands such as water.\n\nHence, the primary reason is the larger size of chloride leading to steric repulsion that favors tetrahedral geometry, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2241984"}]}
