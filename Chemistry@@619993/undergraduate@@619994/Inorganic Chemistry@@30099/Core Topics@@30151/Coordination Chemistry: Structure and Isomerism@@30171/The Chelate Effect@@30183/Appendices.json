[@problem_id:2294177]", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, isomerism plays a crucial role in determining the properties and reactivity of metal complexes. Consider the square planar complex Dichloro(ethylenediamine)platinum(II), with the chemical formula $[Pt(en)Cl_2]$. In this complex, the central platinum(II) ion is coordinated by two monodentate chloride ligands ($Cl^−$) and one bidentate ethylenediamine ligand (en, with structure $\\text{H}_2\\text{N-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-NH}_2$), which binds to the metal center through its two nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor a square planar complex of the type $MA_2B_2$, where M is the metal and A and B are monodentate ligands, two geometric isomers are possible: *cis*, where identical ligands are adjacent (at a 90° angle), and *trans*, where identical ligands are opposite (at a 180° angle). While a *cis* isomer of $[Pt(en)Cl_2]$ exists and is a well-known anticancer drug (a structural analog of cisplatin), the corresponding *trans* isomer is not observed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct fundamental reason for the nonexistence of the *trans* isomer of $[Pt(en)Cl_2]$?\n\nA. The ethylenediamine ligand is a neutral molecule, while the chloride ligands are anionic, and placing the two charged ligands in a *trans* configuration is electrostatically unfavorable.\n\nB. The *trans*-effect of the chloride ligands is so strong that it destabilizes the platinum-nitrogen bonds in the positions opposite to them, preventing the formation of the *trans* isomer.\n\nC. The ethylenediamine ligand is a bidentate ligand with a short carbon backbone, making it geometrically impossible for its two nitrogen donor atoms to span the 180° angle required to occupy *trans* positions in a square planar geometry.\n\nD. The large size of the chloride ligands creates significant steric hindrance when they are in a *cis* configuration, making the *trans* isomer the only stable form, which happens to be unobserved for other kinetic reasons.\n\nE. According to Crystal Field Theory, the d-orbital splitting pattern for a *trans* configuration of this specific ligand set results in a zero Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE), making the complex inherently unstable.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fundamental reason why the complex $[Pt(en)Cl_2]$ cannot exist in a *trans* isomeric form. Let's analyze the structure of the complex and the constraints imposed by its ligands.\n\nThe complex has a square planar geometry. This means the four ligands are arranged around the central $Pt^{2+}$ ion at the corners of a square. The bond angles between adjacent ligands are 90°, and the bond angle between opposite ligands is 180°.\n\nThe ligands are two chloride ions ($Cl^−$) and one ethylenediamine molecule (en).\n-   $Cl^−$ is a monodentate ligand, meaning each one occupies a single coordination site.\n-   Ethylenediamine ($\\text{H}_2\\text{N-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-NH}_2$) is a bidentate ligand. Its two nitrogen atoms both form coordinate bonds with the central platinum ion. This means a single 'en' ligand must occupy two of the four available coordination sites. A ligand that binds through multiple donor atoms to form a ring with the central metal ion is called a chelating ligand.\n\nLet's consider what the *cis* and *trans* isomers would look like for this complex. The terms *cis* and *trans* refer to the relative positions of the two identical chloride ligands.\n\nIn a *cis* isomer, the two $Cl^−$ ligands would be on adjacent corners of the square, with a $Cl-Pt-Cl$ angle of 90°. The remaining two adjacent sites would be occupied by the two nitrogen atoms of the single ethylenediamine ligand. The angle between the two nitrogen donor atoms would be 90°. The structure of ethylenediamine, with its two-carbon backbone ($N\\text{-}C\\text{-}C\\text{-}N$), allows it to comfortably span two adjacent (cis) coordination sites, forming a stable five-membered ring with the platinum atom ($Pt\\text{-}N\\text{-}C\\text{-}C\\text{-}N$). This is a sterically and geometrically favorable arrangement.\n\nIn a hypothetical *trans* isomer, the two $Cl^−$ ligands would be on opposite corners of the square, with a $Cl-Pt-Cl$ bond angle of 180°. Consequently, the two remaining coordination sites, which must be occupied by the single ethylenediamine ligand, are also opposite to each other. This would require the two nitrogen donor atoms of the ethylenediamine molecule to bind to the platinum center with an $N-Pt-N$ bond angle of 180°.\n\nNow, we must consider the structure of the ethylenediamine ligand itself. The two nitrogen atoms are separated by only two single-bonded carbon atoms. This short ethylene bridge ($-CH_2-CH_2-$) is flexible but has a limited length. It is far too short to stretch across the diameter of the coordination sphere to allow the two nitrogen atoms to simultaneously bond at positions 180° apart. Attempting to do so would induce an impossible amount of strain in the molecule. The natural \"bite angle\" of ethylenediamine is close to 90°, which is perfectly suited for occupying *cis* positions but geometrically incompatible with occupying *trans* positions.\n\nTherefore, the nonexistence of the *trans* isomer is a direct consequence of the geometric constraint imposed by the structure of the bidentate chelating ligand.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n-   A: While electrostatic considerations can influence stability, they are not the fundamental reason here. The *cis* isomer also has a specific charge distribution. The geometric impossibility is a much more rigid and absolute constraint.\n-   B: The *trans*-effect describes the influence of a ligand on the rate of substitution of the ligand opposite to it. While the *trans*-effect is a valid concept in platinum chemistry, it does not explain why a stable isomer is impossible to form in the first place. It relates to reactivity, not existence.\n-   C: This statement correctly identifies the core issue. The short backbone of the bidentate ethylenediamine ligand cannot physically span the 180° distance between *trans* coordination sites. This is the correct explanation.\n-   D: This statement is incorrect. The *cis* isomer is the one that is known and stable. The statement incorrectly claims the *trans* isomer would be more stable due to steric hindrance in the *cis* form, which is not the case. The premise of the reasoning is flawed.\n-   E: Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) can predict the relative stability of different geometries or high-spin/low-spin states, but it does not forbid a structure based on the fundamental covalent structure of a ligand. The reason here is related to the physical impossibility of forming the required bonds (a valence bond/steric argument), not an electronic instability predicted by Crystal Field Theory (CFT) alone. A CFSE of zero does not automatically mean a complex is impossible to form.\n\nThus, the only correct explanation is the geometric constraint imposed by the ethylenediamine ligand.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2294177"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the structural rules of chelation, we now turn to the thermodynamic heart of the chelate effect: why is a chelate complex more stable?

The relationship is given by ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. We must compare ΔG° for Reaction A and Reaction B.\n\n3.  **Compare the enthalpy changes (ΔH°).**\n    In both reactions, six coordinate bonds between nickel and oxygen atoms (Ni-O) in the aqua complex are broken, and six coordinate bonds between nickel and nitrogen atoms (Ni-N) are formed. Since both ammonia and ethylenediamine are neutral ligands that coordinate through nitrogen atoms, the strength of the Ni-N bonds formed should be comparable. Therefore, the net enthalpy change (ΔH°) for both reactions is expected to be similar. We cannot confidently predict the favored product based on enthalpy alone.\n\n4.  **Compare the entropy changes (ΔS°).**\n    Entropy (ΔS°) is related to the change in the number of independent particles (disorder) in the system. Let's count the number of free-moving solute species on each side of the equilibria.\n\n    *   **For Reaction A:**\n        Reactants: 1 particle ($[Ni(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$) + 6 particles ($\\text{NH}_3$) = 7 particles\n        Products: 1 particle ($[Ni(\\text{NH}_3)_6]^{2+}$)\n        (We typically ignore the solvent, water, in this particle-counting approximation for solution reactions, or note that it's a net exchange). A more precise count considers the displaced water molecules as products.\n        Reactants (solutes): 7 particles. Products (solutes + displaced solvent not in bulk): 1 complex ion + 6 water molecules = 7 particles.\n        The change in the number of independent particles is approximately zero (Δn ≈ 7 - 7 = 0). Thus, the entropy change (ΔS°) for this reaction is expected to be small.\n\n    *   **For Reaction B:**\n        Reactants: 1 particle ($[Ni(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$) + 3 particles (en) = 4 particles\n        Products: 1 particle ($[Ni(en)_3]^{2+}$)\n        Considering the displaced water:\n        Reactants (solutes): 4 particles. Products (solutes + displaced solvent): 1 complex ion + 6 water molecules = 7 particles.\n        The change in the number of independent particles is significantly positive (Δn ≈ 7 - 4 = +3). This represents a substantial increase in the disorder of the system. Therefore, the entropy change (ΔS°) for this reaction is large and positive.\n\n5.  **Combine enthalpy and entropy to determine Gibbs free energy.**\n    *   ΔG°(Reaction A) = ΔH°(A) - TΔS°(A)\n    *   ΔG°(Reaction B) = ΔH°(B) - TΔS°(B)\n\n    We established that ΔH°(A) ≈ ΔH°(B) and, crucially, ΔS°(B) >> ΔS°(A) (since ΔS°(B) is large and positive, while ΔS°(A) is near zero).\n    The large, positive ΔS° for Reaction B makes the -TΔS° term large and negative. This results in a significantly more negative ΔG° for the formation of the ethylenediamine complex compared to the ammonia complex.\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ(\\text{Reaction B}) \\ll \\Delta G^\\circ(\\text{Reaction A}) $$\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The formation of the chelate complex, $[Ni(en)_3]^{2+}$, is far more thermodynamically favorable than the formation of the monodentate complex, $[Ni(\\text{NH}_3)_6]^{2+}$. This enhanced stability of complexes formed by polydentate ligands is known as the chelate effect. Consequently, at equilibrium, the predominant species in solution will be $[Ni(en)_3]^{2+}$.
