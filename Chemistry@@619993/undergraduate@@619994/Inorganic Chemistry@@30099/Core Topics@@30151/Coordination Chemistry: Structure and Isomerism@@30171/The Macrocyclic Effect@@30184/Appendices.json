Both ligands are capable of forming a 1:1 complex with the metal ion, displacing four water molecules.\n\n- **Ligand A** is the open-chain molecule triethylenetetramine ($\\text{H}_2\\text{N}(\\text{CH}_2)_2\\text{NH}(\\text{CH}_2)_2\\text{NH}(\\text{CH}_2)_2\\text{NH}_2$).\n- **Ligand B** is the cyclic molecule 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (often abbreviated as cyclen), which is the direct cyclic analogue of Ligand A.\n\nBoth ligands coordinate to the $Ni^{2+}$ ion through their four nitrogen donor atoms. An observable difference in thermodynamic stability exists between the resulting complexes, $[Ni(\\text{Ligand A})(H_2O)_2]^{2+}$ and $[Ni(\\text{Ligand B})(H_2O)_2]^{2+}$. This phenomenon is known as the macrocyclic effect.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately identifies the more stable complex and provides the primary thermodynamic reason for its enhanced stability?\n\nA. The complex with Ligand A is more stable because the flexible open chain can better adapt to the ideal coordination geometry of the $Ni^{2+}$ ion, maximizing the favorable enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^\\circ$).\n\nB. The complex with Ligand B is more stable because the rigidity of the cyclic ligand prevents bond angle strain upon coordination, leading to a significantly more favorable enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^\\circ$).\n\nC. The complexes with Ligand A and Ligand B have nearly identical stability because they involve the formation of the same number and type of metal-ligand bonds.\n\nD. The complex with Ligand B is more stable because the ligand is \"pre-organized\" for binding, resulting in a much smaller loss of conformational entropy upon complexation compared to the flexible open-chain ligand.\n\nE. The complex with Ligand A is more stable because its coordination releases more bound solvent molecules into the bulk solution, leading to a more favorable entropy change ($\\Delta S^\\circ$).", "solution": "Write the overall complexation reaction for each ligand $L$ (Ligand A or Ligand B) as\n$$\n[Ni(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{2+} + L \\rightleftharpoons [NiL(H_{2}O)_{2}]^{2+} + 4\\,H_{2}O.\n$$\nDefine the equilibrium constant $K$ for this reaction and the standard thermodynamic relation\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -R T \\ln K = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - T \\Delta S^{\\circ}.\n$$\nTo compare stabilities, compare $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for Ligand A and Ligand B. The complex with the more negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is more stable and has larger $K$.\n\nAnalyze $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$. In both cases, four $Ni$–$N$ coordinate bonds are formed and four $Ni$–$O(H_{2}O)$ bonds are broken. Because the donor atoms and denticity are the same, the dominant enthalpic contributions are similar. Small differences in ring strain or bite angles may slightly affect $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$, but these effects are typically not the primary driver of the macrocyclic effect.\n\nAnalyze $\\Delta S^{\\circ}$. Decompose the entropy change conceptually into contributions, including release of solvent, translational and rotational changes, and conformational (internal) entropy of the ligand:\n$$\n\\Delta S^{\\circ} \\approx \\Delta S_{\\text{solv}}^{\\circ} + \\Delta S_{\\text{trans/rot}}^{\\circ} + \\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}^{\\circ}.\n$$\nFor both Ligand A and Ligand B reactions, four water molecules are released, so $\\Delta S_{\\text{solv}}^{\\circ}$ is comparable. The stoichiometry is the same (one complex formed from one metal ion and one ligand, with the same number of waters released), so the translational and rotational entropy changes are similar.\n\nThe key difference lies in $\\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}^{\\circ}$. Ligand A is an open-chain, highly flexible molecule that loses many conformational microstates upon wrapping around the metal ion to form four chelate rings; this imposes a large unfavorable (more negative) conformational entropy change. Ligand B is a macrocycle that is pre-organized; many of the conformational constraints required for binding are already present in the free ligand, so the loss of conformational entropy upon binding is much smaller. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta S^{\\circ}(\\text{Ligand B}) > \\Delta S^{\\circ}(\\text{Ligand A})\n$$\n(less negative for B), which makes\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}(\\text{Ligand B}) = \\Delta H^{\\circ}(\\text{Ligand B}) - T \\Delta S^{\\circ}(\\text{Ligand B})\n$$\nmore negative than\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}(\\text{Ligand A}) = \\Delta H^{\\circ}(\\text{Ligand A}) - T \\Delta S^{\\circ}(\\text{Ligand A}),\n$$\neven when $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$ values are similar. Consequently, the macrocyclic complex is thermodynamically more stable primarily for entropic reasons (preorganization reduces the entropic penalty).\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: flexibility of the open chain does not generally provide a more favorable $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$; moreover, enthalpy is not the primary driver here.\n- B is incomplete/misleading: while ring preorganization can mitigate strain, the principal macrocyclic effect is not a dramatically more favorable $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$ but rather a less unfavorable $\\Delta S^{\\circ}$.\n- C is incorrect: despite forming the same number/type of bonds, stability differs due to entropy (preorganization).\n- D is correct: the macrocyclic ligand yields a more stable complex due to preorganization, which reduces the loss of conformational entropy upon binding, making $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ more negative.\n- E is incorrect: both reactions release the same number of water molecules, so this contribution does not favor Ligand A over Ligand B.\n\nTherefore, the complex with Ligand B is more stable, primarily due to a more favorable (less negative) entropy change arising from preorganization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2294980"}, {"introduction": "Building on the core principle, this practice [@problem_id:2294978] expands the analysis to a comparative ranking of several complexes.

Complex I, with two bidentate ligands, forms two chelate rings; complex II, with one acyclic tetradentate ligand, forms more chelate rings in a single binding event. This increases overall stability for II relative to I.\n\nFinally, the macrocyclic effect distinguishes III from II. The macrocyclic ligand (cyclam) is preorganized: it imposes a favorable donor geometry around $Cu^{2+}$ before binding.
