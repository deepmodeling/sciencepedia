This exercise moves beyond simple counting to explore the physical principles, particularly steric hindrance, that dictate a complex's final geometry. By analyzing the classic comparison between the $[\\text{FeF}_6]^{3-}$ and $[\\text{FeCl}_4]^{-}$ complexes, you will develop an intuition for the critical interplay between ligand size and the stability of the coordination sphere [@problem_id:2241651].", "problem": "The iron(III) cation, $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$, forms stable coordination complexes with various halide ligands. Experimental evidence shows that with fluoride ions, it predominantly forms the octahedral complex $[\\text{FeF}_6]^{3-}$, resulting in a coordination number of 6. However, with chloride ions, it forms the tetrahedral complex $[\\text{FeCl}_4]^{-}$, corresponding to a coordination number of 4.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most significant and primary reason for this observed difference in coordination numbers?\n\nA. The larger ionic radius of the chloride ion compared to the fluoride ion causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents six chloride ligands from fitting around the central iron(III) ion, thereby favoring a lower coordination number.\n\nB. Fluoride is a significantly stronger-field ligand than chloride, leading to a much larger Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE) for an octahedral geometry, which is not attainable with the weaker-field chloride ligands.\n\nC. According to Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) theory, the hard $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ acid forms a more stable bond with the hard $F^{-}$ base than with the softer $Cl^{-}$ base, and this superior bond stability allows for a higher number of ligands to coordinate.\n\nD. The overall charge of the complex dictates its geometry. A $3-$ charge, as in $[\\text{FeF}_6]^{3-}$, is only stable with an octahedral geometry, while a $1-$ charge, as in $[\\text{FeCl}_4]^{-}$, requires a tetrahedral arrangement.\n\nE. The higher electronegativity of fluorine compared to chlorine causes the Fe-F bond to have a greater ionic character, which in turn draws the ligands closer to the metal center and makes a higher coordination number possible.", "solution": "We identify the electronic structure and key factors governing coordination number. For $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$, the electron configuration is $[Ar]\\,3d^{5}$. With halide ligands such as $F^{-}$ and $Cl^{-}$, which are weak-field ligands, $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ is high spin. The ligand field stabilization energy (LFSE) therefore does not favor octahedral over tetrahedral geometry for a $d^{5}$ high-spin ion:\n- In an octahedral field, the LFSE is computed from $t_{2g}$ stabilization and $e_{g}$ destabilization as\n$$\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}=(-0.4\\Delta_{o})\\times 3 + (0.6\\Delta_{o})\\times 2=0.$$\n- In a tetrahedral field, with splitting $\\Delta_{t}$ and lower $e$ set, the LFSE is\n$$\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{tet}}=(-0.6\\Delta_{t})\\times 2 + (0.4\\Delta_{t})\\times 3=0.$$\nThus, option B, which invokes a much larger LFSE for $F^{-}$ leading to octahedral geometry, is incorrect for high-spin $d^{5}$, since the LFSE is zero in both geometries and differences in field strength between $F^{-}$ and $Cl^{-}$ do not produce a driving force for $6$ versus $4$ coordination here.\n\nThe dominant factor distinguishing $[\\text{FeF}_{6}]^{3-}$ (octahedral, $6$-coordinate) and $[\\text{FeCl}_{4}]^{-}$ (tetrahedral, $4$-coordinate) is steric size of the ligands. Let $r_{\\text{F}^-}$ and $r_{\\text{Cl}^-}$ denote effective ligand radii with $r_{\\text{Cl}^-}>r_{\\text{F}^-}$. For a given metal-ligand equilibrium distance, increasing $r_{L}$ increases ligand-ligand repulsions in crowded coordination spheres. Small ligands like $F^{-}$ can pack six around $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ in an octahedral array without prohibitive steric clash, while larger ligands like $Cl^{-}$ suffer significant steric hindrance in an octahedral environment; reducing the number of ligands to four in a tetrahedral geometry alleviates ligand-ligand crowding. Therefore, option A correctly identifies the primary reason: steric hindrance due to the larger chloride ion favors a lower coordination number.\n\nOption C (HSAB) is not the primary determinant of coordination number. While HSAB rationalizes that hard $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ bonds more strongly to the harder $F^{-}$ than to $Cl^{-}$, this affects bond strength and stability but does not, by itself, set the coordination number; coordination number is primarily governed by the balance of metal-ligand bonding energy and ligand-ligand steric repulsion, which is size-dependent.\n\nOption D is false: overall charge does not dictate geometry; both octahedral and tetrahedral complexes can exist with a wide range of overall charges.\n\nOption E is also not the primary factor: differences in bond ionic character do not chiefly control coordination number; steric size is the dominant effect here.\n\nHence, the most significant and primary reason is steric hindrance from the larger chloride ligands, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2241651"}, {"introduction": "The geometry of a coordination complex has direct and observable consequences, most notably the number of possible geometric isomers.

The coordination geometry is octahedral, and the two 'B' ligands are exclusively in a *cis* configuration.\n\nB. The coordination geometry is trigonal prismatic.\n\nC.

The coordination geometry is a regular octahedron where only one isomer is possible because the *cis* and *trans* forms are energetically degenerate and thus indistinguishable.", "solution": "We are given a monomeric complex with empirical formula $M\\text{A}_{4}\\text{B}_{2}$ in which M is a single metal center and A and B are monodentate ligands. For a six-coordinate complex with monodentate ligands, the common coordination geometries to consider are octahedral, trigonal prismatic, and the much rarer hexagonal planar. The experimental observation that only one unique, stable geometric isomer exists places strong constraints on the geometry and ligand arrangement.\n\nFirst, consider an octahedral coordination environment. In a regular octahedron with formula $M\\text{A}_{4}\\text{B}_{2}$, there are two distinct geometric isomers: cis (the two B ligands adjacent) and trans (the two B ligands opposite). These are stereochemically distinct and are not identical; they are generally distinguishable by spectroscopic and structural methods. Thus, in an unconstrained octahedron both cis and trans are possible and distinct. Therefore, the observation of only one unique isomer implies that one of these arrangements is inaccessible under the actual structural constraints of the complex. A natural and commonly encountered way to enforce uniqueness is when the four identical A ligands occupy a single square plane (equatorial positions) around M, forcing the two B ligands into the axial positions. This arrangement is octahedral with four A ligands coplanar and the two B ligands in trans axial positions, yielding only the trans isomer. The cis alternative would require at least one B ligand in the equatorial plane, contradicting the enforced coplanarity of the four A ligands; thus cis is not realized, and only one unique isomer exists. This directly supports an octahedral geometry with equatorial A and trans axial B, as described in option C. Option E is incorrect because cis and trans are not indistinguishable in a regular octahedron; they are different stereoisomers, regardless of any energetic proximity.\n\nNext, consider trigonal prismatic geometry. In a trigonal prism (two parallel triangular faces), placing four A and two B ligands yields multiple non-equivalent arrangements (for example, placing both B ligands on the same triangular face versus on opposite faces at aligned vertices), so more than one geometric isomer would be expected. This contradicts the observation of a single unique isomer, ruling out option B.\n\nFinally, consider hexagonal planar geometry. A hexagonal planar arrangement with six monodentate ligands is rare and, importantly, allows multiple distinct positional isomers for $M\\text{A}_{4}\\text{B}_{2}$ (e.g., the two B ligands adjacent, separated by one A, or opposite around the hexagon), again contradicting the existence of a single unique isomer. This rules out option D.\n\nBetween the two octahedral statements, option A asserts that the two B ligands are exclusively cis. However, absent special constraints, an octahedral $M\\text{A}_{4}\\text{B}_{2}$ permits both cis and trans, and there is no general symmetry argument that eliminates the trans arrangement while allowing cis. By contrast, if the four A ligands are constrained to be coplanar in a square plane (a common structural motif), then only the trans arrangement for the B ligands is possible, producing a single unique isomer. Therefore, the most accurate and plausible description consistent with the experimental observation is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2241710"}]}
