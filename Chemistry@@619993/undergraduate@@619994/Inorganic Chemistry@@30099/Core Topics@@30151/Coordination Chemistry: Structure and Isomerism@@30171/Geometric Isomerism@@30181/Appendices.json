This exercise challenges you to apply the principles of square planar geometry to a complex with four unique ligands. By focusing on the concept of trans-positioning, you will develop a methodical approach to enumerating geometric isomers, a crucial first step before considering their synthesis or properties [@problem_id:2255041].", "problem": "A synthetic chemist is working to create a series of new platinum-based therapeutic agents. One such compound is a coordination complex featuring a central platinum(II) ion. This ion is coordinated by four distinct, monodentate ligands: one ammine ligand ($\\text{NH}_3$), one pyridine ligand ($\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_5\\text{N}$, abbreviated as py), one chloride ligand ($\\text{Cl}^-$), and one bromide ligand ($\\text{Br}^-$). The resulting complex has a square planar geometry. Determine the total number of distinct geometric isomers that can exist for this complex, $[\\text{Pt}(\\text{NH}_3)(\\text{py})(\\text{Cl})(\\text{Br})]$.", "solution": "For a square planar complex with four distinct monodentate ligands, geometric isomers are defined by which ligands occupy trans positions. In a square planar coordination environment, the four coordination sites split into two pairs of trans positions. Therefore, specifying which two ligands are trans to each other fully determines the isomer; any remaining arrangement differences are related by rotation in space and are not distinct isomers.\n\nLet the ligands be denoted by $A=\\text{NH}_{3}$, $B=\\text{py}$, $C=\\text{Cl}^{-}$, and $D=\\text{Br}^{-}$. The number of distinct isomers equals the number of ways to partition $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ into two unordered trans pairs. This is the number of perfect matchings on four labeled elements:\n$$\n\\text{Number of isomers}=\\frac{(2\\cdot 2)!}{2^{2}\\,2!}=3.\n$$\nEquivalently, one can choose which ligand is trans to $A$; there are $3$ choices (trans to $B$, trans to $C$, or trans to $D$), and once that is fixed the remaining two ligands must be trans to each other, yielding exactly $3$ distinct arrangements:\n- $\\text{NH}_{3}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{py}$ (and hence $\\text{Cl}^{-}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Br}^{-}$),\n- $\\text{NH}_{3}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Cl}^{-}$ (and hence $\\text{py}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Br}^{-}$),\n- $\\text{NH}_{3}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Br}^{-}$ (and hence $\\text{py}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Cl}^{-}$).\n\nNo additional distinct arrangements arise from different cis orderings around the square, because these are interconverted by rigid rotations. Furthermore, square planar complexes of this type are planar and achiral with these achiral monodentate ligands, so there is no optical isomerism to double the count.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct geometric isomers is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2255041"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify and count isomers, the next question is: how do their structures differ in meaningful ways? This practice explores the critical link between geometric arrangement and a fundamental stereochemical property: chirality. By analyzing the symmetry of the *cis* and *trans* isomers of $[Co(en)_2Cl_2]^+$, you will discover how a simple change in ligand placement can determine whether a molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and thus optically active [@problem_id:2255010].", "problem": "A synthetic chemist is investigating the coordination chemistry of cobalt(III).

This complex exhibits an octahedral geometry around the central cobalt ion. Such a complex can exist as different geometric isomers. Your task is to analyze these isomers and determine their relationship with chirality. A molecule is considered chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral molecules are typically optically active.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the chiral geometric isomer(s) of $[\\text{Co}(\\text{en})_2\\text{Cl}_2]^+$?\n\nA.

With two identical monodentate ligands and two identical bidentate chelates, two geometric isomers exist, defined by the relative positions of the two chlorides:\n- The cis isomer: the two $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ligands occupy adjacent (90 degree) positions.\n- The trans isomer: the two $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ligands occupy opposite (180 degree) positions.\n\nChirality criterion for coordination complexes: a molecule is achiral if it possesses any improper symmetry element $S_{n}$, in particular a mirror plane $\\sigma$ or a center of inversion $i$. A molecule is chiral if it lacks all improper symmetry elements.\n\nTrans isomer: Place the cobalt at the origin and the two $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ligands along $+z$ and $-z$. The two $\\text{en}$ chelates then occupy the four positions in the equatorial plane, each binding through two adjacent nitrogen donors. Because the two chlorides are trans, the structure has an inversion center at the metal: the inversion operation $\\mathbf{r}\\mapsto -\\mathbf{r}$ maps the ligand set onto itself (the $\\text{Cl}$ at $+z$ maps to the $\\text{Cl}$ at $-z$, and each nitrogen donor of a given $\\text{en}$ maps to an equivalent nitrogen donor of the other $\\text{en}$). The presence of $i$ renders the trans isomer achiral.\n\nCis isomer: The two $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ligands are adjacent. With two chelating $\\text{en}$ ligands completing the octahedron, the arrangement of the two chelate rings imparts a helical twist about the metal center. In this geometry there is no inversion center (the chlorides are not opposite), and no mirror plane $\\sigma$ can exist that reflects the chelate ring connectivity onto itself without generating the mirror image; equivalently, there is no improper rotation $S_{n}$ present. Consequently, the cis isomer lacks all improper symmetry elements and is chiral, existing as a pair of enantiomers (helical $\\Delta$ and $\\Lambda$ forms).\n\nTherefore, only the cis isomer is chiral and the trans isomer is achiral.\n\nThe correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2255010"}, {"introduction": "The existence of different isomers immediately raises questions about their relative stability.
