In this complex, a central iron(III) ion is coordinated by three identical oxalate ligands ($C_2O_4^{2-}$), which act as bidentate ligands.

The complex is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\nD. The complex does not exhibit any form of isomerism as all ligands are identical.\n\nE. The complex exhibits linkage isomerism because the oxalate ligand can bind in different ways.", "solution": "We analyze the octahedral complex ion $[Fe(C_2O_4)_3]^{3-}$, where three identical oxalate ligands $C_2O_4^{2-}$ act as bidentate chelates. Such a complex is of the general type $[M(AA)_3]$, with $AA$ a symmetric bidentate ligand.\n\nFirst, geometric isomerism of the fac/mer type (option A) applies to $MA_3B_3$ systems with monodentate ligands, distinguishing arrangements where three identical ligands occupy one face (fac) or a meridian (mer). In a tris-bidentate complex $[M(AA)_3]$, there are no three separate identical monodentate positions to define fac versus mer; the chelate rings fix pairs of donor atoms and eliminate this possibility. Therefore fac/mer isomerism does not occur.\n\nSecond, cis/trans geometric isomerism (option B) is characteristic of $MA_4B_2$ or $MA_2B_2$-type octahedral complexes with monodentate ligands or certain mixed chelate/mono arrangements. In $[M(AA)_3]$, each bidentate ligand occupies adjacent positions forming a five-membered chelate ring; there is no alternative arrangement of identical chelates that yields distinct cis versus trans dispositions without breaking chelate rings. Hence cis/trans isomerism does not occur.\n\nThird, linkage isomerism (option E) requires an ambidentate ligand that can coordinate through different donor atoms (e.g., $NO_2^-$ via N or O). Oxalate $C_2O_4^{2-}$ in this complex coordinates as a chelating dianion through two equivalent oxygen donors; there is no alternative heteroatom donor set within the ligand that would produce linkage isomers. Thus linkage isomerism does not occur.\n\nFourth, despite all ligands being identical, $[M(AA)_3]$ octahedral complexes are generally chiral because the three chelate rings can adopt a helical arrangement of either right-handed ($\\Delta$) or left-handed ($\\Lambda$) twist. The complex lacks a center of inversion, a mirror plane, and an improper rotation axis that would relate these forms, so it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore option C is correct, and option D is false.\n\nHence, $[Fe(C_2O_4)_3]^{3-}$ exhibits optical isomerism and exists as $\\Delta$ and $\\Lambda$ enantiomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2275451"}, {"introduction": "Once we know a complex is chiral, we need a precise language to describe its specific spatial arrangement.

To document the structure of the specific enantiomer obtained, the chemist describes its geometry using a Cartesian coordinate system with the central Ruthenium(II) ion located at the origin (0, 0, 0).\n\nThe six coordinating nitrogen atoms of the three bipyridine ligands are described as follows:\n- Three nitrogen atoms, which we can label as Set A, form an equilateral triangle in the plane $z = +c$.

Thus, for all three chelates,\n$$\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{short}}=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}>0.$$\n\nViewed from $+z$ looking toward the origin (i.e., from the top face down the threefold axis), a positive $\\Delta\\theta$ means that as one moves away from the observer (from $z=+c$ to $z=-c$), the azimuth increases, corresponding to a counterclockwise rotation. By the standard convention for octahedral tris(bidentate) complexes, a counterclockwise winding away from the viewer defines the left-handed enantiomer, $\\Lambda$, whereas a clockwise winding defines the right-handed enantiomer, $\\Delta$.\n\nSince each chelate shows $\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{short}}>0$ (counterclockwise as one descends), all three chelates have the same left-handed helicity, and the complex is the $\\Lambda$ enantiomer.

There is a vertical mirror plane containing the $z$-axis and bisecting the angle between $x$ and $y$ that exchanges the two $NH_3$ and separately the two $H_2O$ positions while leaving Br fixed, so a mirror plane exists.
