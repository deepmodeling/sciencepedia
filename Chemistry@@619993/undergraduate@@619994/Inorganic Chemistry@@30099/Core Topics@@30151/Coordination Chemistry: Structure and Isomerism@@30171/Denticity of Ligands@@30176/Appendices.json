This exercise provides a foundational practice for calculating two of the most important properties of a coordination complex: its coordination number and its overall charge. By working through the assembly of a complex from its constituent metal ion and ligands, you will develop the essential skill of translating ligand properties, like denticity and charge, into the final characteristics of the complex ion [@problem_id:2244657].", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, a central metal ion binds to one or more surrounding molecules or ions, known as ligands, to form a coordination complex. The number of points of attachment from the ligands to the central atom is called the coordination number. Some ligands are capable of forming more than one bond with the central metal ion; this property is known as denticity. For instance, a bidentate ligand is a ligand that can form two bonds to a central metal ion.\n\nConsider the formation of a complex ion where a single central cobalt(III) ion ($Co^{3+}$) is coordinated by three oxalate ions ($C_2O_4^{2-}$). In this complex, each oxalate ion functions as a bidentate ligand.\n\nDetermine two properties of the resulting complex ion: first, the coordination number of the central cobalt(III) ion, and second, the overall electrical charge of the entire complex ion. Report your final answer as a pair of integers in the format (Coordination Number, Overall Charge).", "solution": "We identify the ligands and their denticity, then compute the coordination number and the overall charge.\n\nEach oxalate ion, $C_{2}O_{4}^{2-}$, is bidentate, meaning it donates two electron pairs to the metal center. With three oxalate ligands coordinated to a single cobalt(III) ion, the number of donor atoms attached to the metal is\n$$\n\\text{Coordination number} = 3 \\times 2 = 6.\n$$\n\nTo find the overall charge $Q$ of the complex ion, we add the charge of the central metal ion to the total charge contributed by the ligands. The cobalt center is $Co^{3+}$, so $q_{\\text{metal}} = +3$. Each oxalate ligand has charge $-2$, so for three ligands the total ligand charge is\n$$\nq_{\\text{ligands}} = 3 \\times (-2) = -6.\n$$\nThus, the overall charge is\n$$\nQ = q_{\\text{metal}} + q_{\\text{ligands}} = (+3) + (-6) = -3.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the required pair is the coordination number $6$ and the overall charge $-3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}6 & -3\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2244657"}, {"introduction": "Why are some multidentate ligands excellent chelators while others are not? This problem moves beyond simple counting to explore the underlying principles that govern the stability of chelate rings. By comparing two seemingly similar diamine ligands, you will uncover the critical role that ring strain plays in determining a ligand's ability to chelate, providing deeper insight into the celebrated chelate effect [@problem_id:2244648].", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, a ligand is a molecule or ion that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex. The number of donor atoms in a single ligand that bind to the metal is known as its denticity. Ligands that can bind to a metal through two or more donor atoms are called polydentate ligands. When a polydentate ligand binds to a single central metal atom using two or more of its donor atoms, it forms a ring-like structure, a process known as chelation. This typically results in a more stable complex compared to one formed with analogous monodentate ligands, an observation known as the chelate effect.\n\nConsider two simple diamine ligands: ethylenediamine ($H_2N-CH_2-CH_2-NH_2$) and hydrazine ($H_2N-NH_2$). Both molecules possess two nitrogen atoms, each with a lone pair of electrons capable of acting as a donor site. Ethylenediamine is a classic example of an excellent chelating ligand, readily forming a stable five-membered ring with a metal ion. In contrast, hydrazine almost exclusively acts as a monodentate ligand (binding through only one nitrogen atom) or as a bridging ligand (linking two different metal centers), and it is considered a very poor chelating agent.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the primary chemical reason for hydrazine's inability to act as an effective chelating ligand?\n\nA. The lone pairs on the adjacent nitrogen atoms in hydrazine create significant electrostatic repulsion, preventing them from coordinating to the same metal center.\nB. The nitrogen atoms in hydrazine are $sp$ hybridized, resulting in a linear geometry that is incompatible with forming a chelate ring.\nC. Hydrazine is highly unstable and readily decomposes in the presence of metal ions, preventing the formation of any stable complex.\nD. When hydrazine binds to a single metal center through both nitrogen atoms, it forms a three-membered chelate ring that is subject to extremely high angle strain.\nE. Hydrazine is a powerful reducing agent, and its tendency to reduce the metal ion is overwhelmingly favored over the process of chelation.", "solution": "Chelation requires a ligand to bind a single metal center through two donor atoms so that a ring containing the metal and the donor-bearing atoms is formed. The stability of such chelates depends strongly on the size of the ring and the associated bite angle at the metal; five- and six-membered chelate rings are favored because they impose bite angles that are compatible with common coordination geometries, minimizing angular strain.\n\nFor ethylenediamine, simultaneous coordination through both nitrogen atoms yields a five-membered chelate ring, conventionally counted as M–N–C–C–N, which accommodates a bite angle that is close to the preferred range for square-planar and octahedral metal centers, and thus is strongly stabilized.\n\nIf hydrazine were to bind bidentate to a single metal through both nitrogen atoms, the smallest ring that could be formed is M–N–N, which is a three-membered ring. Three-membered chelate rings impose extremely small bite angles at the metal (on the order of that associated with a three-membered cycle), leading to very high angle strain and poor orbital overlap between the metal and both donor atoms simultaneously. This severe geometric penalty renders such a chelation mode highly unfavorable. Consequently, hydrazine instead binds as a monodentate ligand through one nitrogen or acts as a bridging ligand, using each nitrogen to bind different metal centers and thereby avoiding the strained three-membered ring.\n\nAlternative explanations are not primary: the presence of two lone pairs on adjacent nitrogens (A) does not inherently prevent chelation, as shown by other diamines; the nitrogen atoms in hydrazine are approximately pyramidal and best described as near $sp^{3}$, not $sp$ (so B is incorrect); hydrazine does form stable complexes and is not generally too unstable to coordinate (C is incorrect); and while hydrazine can be a reducing agent, reduction does not universally preclude chelation and does not specifically explain the failure to form a bidentate complex (E is not the primary reason).\n\nTherefore, the principal chemical reason hydrazine fails to act as an effective chelating ligand is the prohibitive angle strain associated with forming a three-membered chelate ring when both nitrogens bind to the same metal center.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2244648"}, {"introduction": "The principles of denticity and chelation are not just theoretical; they are powerful tools for designing functional molecules. This advanced problem places you at the frontier of catalyst design, where ligands are engineered to change their denticity in response to a redox stimulus. You will use electrochemical data to quantify the behavior of a \"smart\" ligand, linking macroscopic measurements to the microscopic equilibrium between different coordination modes and demonstrating how fundamental concepts drive innovation in chemistry [@problem_id:2244649].", "problem": "In the field of organometallic catalysis, chemists are designing \"smart\" ligands that can respond to a change in the metal's oxidation state. One such strategy involves a ligand whose denticity (the number of coordinating atoms) changes upon a redox event, creating a vacant coordination site necessary for a substrate to bind.\n\nConsider a hypothetical cobalt complex, `[CoL]`, synthesized with a specially designed tetradentate ligand `L`. In the cobalt(II) oxidation state, the complex `[Co(II)L]` is coordinatively saturated, with the ligand `L` confirmed to be tetradentate. Upon one-electron oxidation, the cobalt(III) complex, `[Co(III)L]^+`, is formed. It is proposed that the increased Lewis acidity of the Co(III) center causes one of the ligand's donor arms to detach, resulting in an equilibrium between a tetradentate form and a catalytically active tridentate form which possesses one vacant coordination site.\n\nThe overall redox process can be represented by:\n`[Co(III)L]^+_{total} + e^- \\rightleftharpoons [Co(II)L]_{total}`\n\nElectrochemical measurements were performed to quantify this behavior at a temperature of `298.15 K`. The measured formal potential for the `[CoL]` system was found to be `E_{exp} = +0.175` V (versus the Ferrocenium/Ferrocene couple, Fc+/Fc).\n\nTo determine the intrinsic potential of the system without the change in denticity, a closely related model complex, `[CoL']`, was synthesized. The ligand `L'` is designed to be structurally and electronically similar to `L` but is conformationally rigid, forcing it to remain tetradentate in both the Co(II) and Co(III) oxidation states. The formal potential for this model complex, `[CoL']`, was measured under identical conditions to be `E_{model} = +0.350` V vs. Fc+/Fc. You may assume that `E_{model}` perfectly represents the hypothetical redox potential of the `[CoL]` complex if it were forced to remain tetradentate in both oxidation states.\n\nUsing the provided data, calculate the fraction of the `[Co(III)L]^+` complex that exists in the tridentate form at equilibrium at `298.15 K`.\n\nNecessary constants are the gas constant, `R = 8.314 J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}`, and the Faraday constant, `F = 96485 C \\cdot mol^{-1}`.
