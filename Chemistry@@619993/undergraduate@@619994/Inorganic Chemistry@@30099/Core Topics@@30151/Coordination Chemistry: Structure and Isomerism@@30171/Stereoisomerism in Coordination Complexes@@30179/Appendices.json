This practice focuses on a complex with two identical, symmetric bidentate ligands and two identical monodentate ligands, a common structural motif of the type $M(AA)_2X_2$. By analyzing the possible `cis` and `trans` arrangements of the monodentate ligands, you will learn to identify geometric isomers and use key symmetry elements, like a center of inversion, to determine which isomers are chiral and thus optically active [@problem_id:2289891].", "problem": "A chemist is investigating the stereochemistry of a newly synthesized octahedral coordination complex containing iridium(III). The chemical formula of the complex ion is $[\\text{IrCl}_2(\\text{ox})_2]^{3-}$, where 'ox' represents the bidentate oxalate ligand, $\\text{C}_2\\text{O}_4^{2-}$. Stereoisomers are isomers that have the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space.\n\nYour task is to analyze the possible stereoisomers for this complex. Determine the total number of unique stereoisomers that can exist for $[\\text{IrCl}_2(\\text{ox})_2]^{3-}$. Then, determine how many of these unique stereoisomers are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\nProvide your answer as two integers: the first integer representing the total number of stereoisomers, and the second integer representing the number of chiral stereoisomers.", "solution": "We identify the coordination environment as octahedral around Ir(III) with ligand set consisting of two identical monodentate chlorides ($\\text{Cl}^{-}$) and two identical symmetric bidentate oxalates ($\\text{ox}^{2-}$). Such a complex can be classified as $M(AA)_{2}X_{2}$, where $AA$ is a symmetric bidentate ligand and $X$ is a monodentate ligand.\n\nStep 1: Enumerate possible geometrical isomers.\nIn an octahedral complex with two identical monodentate ligands, there are two distinct relative arrangements for the $X_{2}$ fragment:\n- Trans: the two $X$ ligands occupy opposite coordination sites.\n- Cis: the two $X$ ligands occupy adjacent coordination sites.\nSince the two bidentate oxalate ligands are identical and symmetric, there are no additional distinct geometrical arrangements beyond cis and trans for $[M(ox)_{2}X_{2}]$.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two geometrical isomers: cis and trans.\n\nStep 2: Determine optical activity of each geometrical isomer.\n- Trans-$[M(ox)_{2}X_{2}]$: Place the two $X$ ligands opposite each other. The remaining four equatorial positions are occupied by the two oxalate chelates, each binding to adjacent positions in the equatorial plane. In this arrangement, there exists a center of inversion at the metal center: each donor atom is mapped to an identical donor atom in the position opposite through the metal, and the two $X$ ligands map onto each other. The presence of an inversion center renders the trans isomer achiral. Hence, the trans isomer is a single, achiral stereoisomer.\n- Cis-$[M(ox)_{2}X_{2}]$: With the two $X$ ligands adjacent, the complex lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. For symmetric bidentate chelates such as oxalate, the cis-$M(AA)_{2}X_{2}$ geometry is chiral and occurs as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images characterized by opposite helicities, commonly denoted $\\Delta$ and $\\Lambda$. Therefore, the cis isomer gives two enantiomers, both chiral.\n\nStep 3: Count unique stereoisomers and chiral ones.\n- Unique stereoisomers: one trans (achiral) plus two enantiomers of cis, totaling $3$.\n- Chiral stereoisomers: the two cis enantiomers, totaling $2$.\n\nThus, the total number of stereoisomers is $3$, of which $2$ are chiral.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}3 & 2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2289891"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational concepts, this next practice introduces more variety into the ligand sphere. We will examine a complex of the type $M(AA)B_2C_2$, containing one bidentate ligand and two different pairs of monodentate ligands. This scenario requires a more careful, systematic approach to enumerate all possible geometric isomers and then assess the chirality of each unique arrangement, strengthening your problem-solving skills for more complex systems [@problem_id:2289857].", "problem": "Coordination complexes often exhibit stereoisomerism, a phenomenon where molecules have the same chemical formula and connectivity but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms. Consider the octahedral coordination complex ion with the formula $[\\text{Rh}(\\text{en})(\\text{py})_2\\text{Cl}_2]^+$. In this complex, the central metal atom is rhodium (Rh). The ligands are ethylenediamine (`en`), which is a symmetric bidentate ligand, and pyridine (`py`) and chloride (`Cl`), which are both monodentate ligands.\n\nDetermine the total number of stereoisomers possible for this complex ion.", "solution": "We analyze the stereochemistry of the octahedral complex ion $[\\mathrm{Rh}(\\mathrm{en})(\\mathrm{py})_{2}\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}]^{+}$, where ethylenediamine (en) is a symmetric bidentate ligand and pyridine (py) and chloride (Cl) are monodentate ligands.\n\n1) Fundamental geometric constraint: In an octahedral complex, a bidentate ligand such as en must bind to two adjacent (cis) coordination sites; it cannot span trans positions. Therefore, en occupies two cis sites, leaving four remaining sites to be occupied by two py and two Cl ligands.\n\n2) Fixing a reference frame: Place en on two adjacent positions. The four remaining sites can be viewed as consisting of one trans pair and one cis pair relative to each other. Concretely, after fixing en on two adjacent positions, among the remaining four positions there is exactly one trans pair; the other two are cis to each other. Hence, distributing two identical py and two identical Cl over these four positions leads to the following distinct geometric patterns:\n- Case A (py trans): The two py occupy the unique trans pair; the two Cl necessarily occupy the two remaining cis positions.\n- Case B (Cl trans): The two Cl occupy the unique trans pair; the two py occupy the two remaining cis positions.\n- Case C (all-cis): Neither pair occupies the trans pair; both the py ligands are mutually cis and both the Cl ligands are mutually cis (each pair split between one position of the trans pair and one of the cis positions), yielding no trans relationship for either pair.\n\nThese three are not interconvertible by proper rotations and hence constitute three distinct geometrical isomers.\n\n3) Optical activity analysis:\n- In Case A (py trans) and Case B (Cl trans), the arrangement possesses a mirror plane that bisects the chelate edge and exchanges the two identical ligands in the cis equatorial positions while leaving the trans pair invariant. Because a mirror plane is an improper symmetry element, each of these isomers is achiral and corresponds to a single stereoisomer.\n- In Case C (all-cis), the arrangement lacks any improper symmetry element (no mirror plane, no inversion center, no improper rotation), so it is chiral and occurs as a pair of non-superposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, Case C contributes two stereoisomers.\n\n4) Counting stereoisomers: The total number is the sum of achiral geometrical isomers (one each from Cases A and B) plus the enantiomeric pair from Case C, giving $2+2=4$ stereoisomers in total.\n\nTherefore, the complex $[\\mathrm{Rh}(\\mathrm{en})(\\mathrm{py})_{2}\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}]^{+}$ has $4$ stereoisomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2289857"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice introduces a subtle but important feature: an asymmetric bidentate ligand. The inherent lack of symmetry in the chelating ligand itself can have profound consequences for the overall chirality of the complex, often removing symmetry elements that would otherwise be present.

Let the asymmetric bidentate glycinato ligand (N,O donors) occupy an adjacent pair, viewed as an edge of the octahedron. The remaining four sites form a set on which the symmetry operations that preserve the chelate edge as an unordered pair act as the dihedral group $D_{2d}$ on a square of four positions.\n\nFirst, enumerate distinct geometric isomers (ignoring optical isomerism) by distributing two identical $\\text{NH}_{3}$ and two identical $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ligands over these four positions under $D_{2d}$. Up to $D_{2d}$, there are two basic two-colorings of a square with two of each color: opposite and adjacent. Because the two ligand types are different, the “opposite” pattern splits into two non-equivalent arrangements depending on which pair is opposite. Thus there are exactly three geometric arrangements:\n- $\\text{NH}_{3}$ opposite (hence $\\text{NH}_{3}$ trans across the octahedron, $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ cis),\n- $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ opposite (hence $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ trans, $\\text{NH}_{3}$ cis),\n- both pairs adjacent (neither pair trans; both pairs cis).\n\nNext, incorporate the fact that gly is an asymmetric bidentate ligand (N,O). For each of the three geometric arrangements, the N and O donors of gly are inequivalent and their fixed orientation removes all improper symmetry elements that could make the complex achiral. Concretely, any mirror plane containing or perpendicular to the chelate edge would either interchange $\\text{NH}_{3}$ and $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ or interchange the N and O donor sites, and an inversion center is absent in all three geometries because at least one like pair is not situated at opposite vertices about the metal while the chelate itself is unsymmetrical. Thus each of the three geometric arrangements has no improper symmetry (point group $C_{1}$) and is therefore chiral, existing as a pair of enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of stereoisomers (geometric plus optical) is the sum over the three geometric types, each contributing two enantiomers:\n$$3 \\times 2 = 6.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2289819"}]}
