The ethylenediamine ligand, en, is bidentate and neutral. The sulfite ligand, $\\mathrm{SO}_3^{2-}$, is ambidentate and can bind either through sulfur (giving a $\\mathrm{Pd-S}$ bond; sulfito-$S$) or through oxygen (giving a $\\mathrm{Pd-O}$ bond; sulfito-$O$). Two neutral products from the same empirical composition strongly suggest linkage isomerism between $S$-bound and $O$-bound sulfite.\n\nTo interpret the IR data, we use the diatomic oscillator model for vibrational frequencies. For a given bond (here S-O stretches), the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ satisfies\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}},\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the vibrating pair. For S-O stretching modes comparing the two isomers, $\\mu$ is effectively the same, so a higher observed wavenumber directly reflects a larger $k$, i.e., stronger S-O bonds.\n\nCoordination mode affects S-O bond strength. When sulfite binds via oxygen ($\\mathrm{Pd-O}$), electron donation from that oxygen to the metal tends to decrease the S-O bond order (more single-bond character at the coordinated O), lowering the S-O force constants and thus shifting S-O stretches to lower wavenumbers. Conversely, when sulfite binds via sulfur ($\\mathrm{Pd-S}$), the S lone pair coordinates to the metal without directly weakening any specific S-O bond; resonance can enhance S=O character on the O atoms, increasing the average S-O force constants and shifting S-O stretches to higher wavenumbers. This qualitative trend is analogous to the well-known case of $\\mathrm{NO}_2^{-}$, where M-N (nitro) shows higher N-O stretches than M-O (nitrito).\n\nTherefore, the isomer with higher S-O stretching frequencies (Isomer X) must be the S-bound sulfite (containing a $\\mathrm{Pd-S}$ bond), while the isomer with lower S-O stretching frequencies (Isomer Y) must be the O-bound sulfite (containing a $\\mathrm{Pd-O}$ bond). These are linkage isomers.\n\nThe alternative options are inconsistent:\n- Coordination isomerism (option C) is inapplicable here; swapping ligand order does not create a distinct isomer.\n- Ionization isomerism with en as a counter-ion (option D) is impossible because en is neutral.\n- Polymorphism (option E) would not produce large shifts in intrinsic S-O stretching frequencies attributable to bonding mode changes.\n\nHence, the correct statement is that X and Y are linkage isomers, with X containing $\\mathrm{Pd-S}$ and Y containing $\\mathrm{Pd-O}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2240379"}, {"introduction": "Coordination isomerism involves the exchange of ligands between a complex cation and a complex anion, creating distinct ionic compounds from the same set of building blocks.
