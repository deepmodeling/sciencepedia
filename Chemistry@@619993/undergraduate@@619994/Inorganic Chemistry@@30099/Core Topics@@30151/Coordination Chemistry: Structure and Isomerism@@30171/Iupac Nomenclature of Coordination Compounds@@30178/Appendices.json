Since there are two of them, the prefix \"di-\" is used, giving \"dichloro\".\nThe name for the PPh₃ ligand is \"triphenylphosphine\". Because this ligand name itself contains a numerical prefix (\"tri-\"), we must use the special prefixes for multiple complex ligands: bis- for two, tris- for three, tetrakis- for four, etc. Since there are two triphenylphosphine ligands, the name is \"bis(triphenylphosphine)\". The ligand name is placed in parentheses.\n\nStep 4: Order the ligands alphabetically.\nThe ligands are listed alphabetically according to their names, ignoring the numerical prefixes (di-, tri-, bis-, tris-, etc.).\nWe compare \"chloro\" and \"triphenylphosphine\".\n'c' in chloro comes before 't' in triphenylphosphine.\nTherefore, the ligand part of the name is \"dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)\".\n\nStep 5: Name the central metal.\nThe name of the central metal depends on the charge of the complex.\n- If the complex is anionic (has a negative charge), the metal's name ends in \"-ate\" (e.g., zincate, ferrate, cuprate).\n- If the complex is neutral or cationic (has a positive charge), the metal's element name is used as is.\nIn this case, the complex is neutral, so the metal is named \"zinc\".\n\nStep 6: Assemble the full name.\nThe full name is assembled in the following order: (ligand names in alphabetical order) + (metal name) + (oxidation state in parentheses).\nCombining the parts from the previous steps:\ndichlorobis(triphenylphosphine) + zinc + (II)\nThe correct name is: dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)zinc(II).\n\nStep 7: Compare with the given options.\nA. bis(triphenylphosphine)dichlorozinc(II) - Incorrect alphabetical order of ligands.\nB. dichloroditriphenylphosphinezinc(II) - Incorrect prefix for triphenylphosphine; \"di-\" is used instead of \"bis-\".\nC. dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)zinc(II) - This matches our derived name.\nD. dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)zincate(II) - Incorrect metal suffix; \"-ate\" is for anionic complexes, but this complex is neutral.\nE. dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)zinc(0) - Incorrect oxidation state for zinc.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2263238"}, {"introduction": "Nomenclature is a two-way street; not only must we name structures, but we must also be able to deduce a formula from a name.

First, we must deduce the chemical formula from the given name, and second, we must determine the name of a described ionization isomer.\n\n**Part 1: Deducing the chemical formula for pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) sulfate**\n\n1.  **Identify Components:** The name can be broken down into the cation (the coordination complex) and the anion (the counter-ion).\n    *   Cation: `pentaamminechloridocobalt(III)`\n    *   Anion: `sulfate`\n\n2.  **Analyze the Cation (Coordination Complex):**\n    *   **Central Metal:** `cobalt` indicates the central metal is Co. The Roman numeral `(III)` specifies its oxidation state is $+3$.\n    *   **Ligands:** The ligands are listed before the metal.\n        *   `pentaammine`: This indicates five (`penta-`) ammine ligands. The ammine ligand is neutral ammonia, `NH3`. Total charge from these ligands is $5 \\times 0 = 0$.\n        *   `chlorido`: This indicates one chloride ligand, `Cl-`. Its charge is $-1$.\n    *   **Calculate the Charge of the Complex Ion:** The total charge of the coordination sphere is the sum of the charge of the central metal and the charges of the ligands.\n        Charge = (oxidation state of Co) + (charge from `NH3`) + (charge from `Cl-`)\n        Charge = $(+3) + (5 \\times 0) + (-1) = +2$.\n    *   **Formula of the Complex Ion:** The formula is written by placing the metal symbol first, followed by the ligands. By convention, ligands are often written with anionic ligands before neutral ones inside the brackets, but placing them alphabetically is also common. Let's stick to the common textbook representation placing neutral ligands first when their formula is simpler. The complex ion is $[\\text{Co(NH}_3\\text{)}_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Anion (Counter-ion):**\n    *   The counter-ion is `sulfate`. The sulfate ion has the formula `SO4` and a charge of $-2$. So, it is $SO_4^{2-}$.\n\n4.  **Combine the Cation and Anion:** To form a neutral salt, the total positive charge must balance the total negative charge. The complex cation has a charge of $+2$, and the sulfate anion has a charge of $-2$. Therefore, they combine in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The chemical formula for pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) sulfate is $\\text{[Co(NH}_3\\text{)}_5\\text{Cl]SO}_4$.\n\n**Part 2: Naming the ionization isomer**\n\n1.  **Identify the Isomer's Composition:** The problem states that the isomer is formed by exchanging the `chlorido` ligand ($Cl^−$) with the `sulfate` counter-ion ($SO_4^{2−}$).\n    *   **Original:** Complex $[\\text{Co(NH}_3\\text{)}_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$, Counter-ion $SO_4^{2-}$\n    *   **Isomer:** The $SO_4^{2−}$ becomes a ligand and the $Cl^−$ becomes the counter-ion.\n        *   New Central Metal and Ligands: The coordination sphere now contains one `Co` atom, five `NH3` molecules, and one $SO_4^{2−}$ ion.\n        *   New Counter-ion: The counter-ion is now $Cl^−$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Formula of the Isomer's Complex Ion:**\n    *   Central Metal: `Co` with oxidation state $+3$ (ionization isomerism does not change the metal's oxidation state).\n    *   Ligands: five `NH3` (charge 0) and one $SO_4^{2−}$ (charge -2).\n    *   **Calculate the Charge of the New Complex Ion:**\n        Charge = (oxidation state of Co) + (charge from `NH3`) + (charge from $SO_4^{2−}$)\n        Charge = $(+3) + (5 \\times 0) + (-2) = +1$.\n    *   The new complex ion is $[\\text{Co(NH}_3\\text{)}_5\\text{(SO}_4\\text{)}]^{+}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Overall Formula of the Isomer:** The complex ion $[\\text{Co(NH}_3\\text{)}_5\\text{(SO}_4\\text{)}]^{+}$ (charge $+1$) combines with the counter-ion $Cl^−$ (charge $-1$) in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The formula for the isomer is $[\\text{Co(NH}_3\\text{)}_5\\text{(SO}_4\\text{)]Cl}$.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Rules to Name the Isomer:**\n    *   **Name the Ligands:** The ligands are `ammine` ($NH_3$) and `sulfato` ($SO_4^{2−}$). They are named alphabetically. `ammine` comes before `sulfato`.\n    *   **Use Prefixes:** `penta-` for five ammine ligands. `pentaammine`. No prefix is needed for the single `sulfato` ligand.\n    *   **Name the Central Metal:** The complex ion $[\\text{Co(NH}_3\\text{)}_5\\text{(SO}_4\\text{)}]^{+}$ is cationic. Therefore, the metal name remains `cobalt`. If the complex were anionic, the suffix `-ate` would be added (e.g., `cobaltate`).\n    *   **Specify Oxidation State:** The oxidation state of cobalt is `(III)`. This is written in Roman numerals in parentheses after the metal name.\n    *   **Combine Cation Name:** `pentaamminesulfatocobalt(III)`\n    *   **Name the Counter-ion:** The counter-ion is $Cl^−$, which is named `chloride`. Note that prefixes are not used for counter-ions.\n    *   **Full Name:** Combining the cation and anion names yields `pentaamminesulfatocobalt(III) chloride`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   The formula for the original compound is $\\text{[Co(NH}_3\\text{)}_5\\text{Cl]SO}_4$.\n*   The name of the ionization isomer is `pentaamminesulfatocobalt(III) chloride`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that option B is the correct choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2263254"}, {"introduction": "The true power of IUPAC nomenclature lies in its ability to describe complex three-dimensional structures with complete accuracy.
