In the limiting $NO^{-}$ formalism, there are two electrons in the degenerate $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, rendering the ligand a poorer $\\pi$ acceptor and potentially a $\\pi$ donor. Now, further metal-to-ligand $\\pi$ backbonding is disfavored because the relevant ligand orbitals are occupied; instead, filled–filled interactions between metal $d_{\\pi}$ and ligand $\\pi^{*}$ become antibonding. To minimize such unfavorable interactions, the complex adopts a bent M–N–O geometry, which reduces the degeneracy and overlap of the ligand $\\pi$ set with the metal $d_{\\pi}$ orbitals (reducing $|H_{ij}|$ for antibonding contacts).
