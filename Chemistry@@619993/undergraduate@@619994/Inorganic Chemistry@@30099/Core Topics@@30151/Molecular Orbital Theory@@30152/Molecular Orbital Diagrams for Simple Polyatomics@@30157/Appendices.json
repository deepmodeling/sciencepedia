Mastering this process allows us to rationalize molecular structure and electron distribution, such as identifying the nature of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).", "problem": "The hydronium ion, $H_3O^+$, is a fundamental species in aqueous chemistry. It adopts a pyramidal geometry with the oxygen atom at the apex, belonging to the $C_{3v}$ point group. Using a basis set of the oxygen 2s and 2p atomic orbitals and the hydrogen 1s atomic orbitals, a molecular orbital (MO) diagram can be constructed.\n\nThe character table for the $C_{3v}$ point group is provided below, where $z$ is aligned with the principal $C_3$ axis.\n\n| $C_{3v}$ | $E$ | $2C_3$ | $3\\sigma_v$ | Linear, rotations | Quadratic |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $A_1$ | 1 | 1 | 1 | $z$ | $x^2+y^2, z^2$ |\n| $A_2$ | 1 | 1 | -1 | $R_z$ | |\n| $E$ | 2 | -1 | 0 | $(x, y), (R_x, R_y)$ | $(x^2-y^2, xy), (xz, yz)$|\n\nBased on the molecular orbital model for $H_3O^+$, which of the following statements correctly identifies its ground-state valence electron configuration and its Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO)?\n\nA.

The HOMO is the $1e$ orbital.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ground-state valence electron configuration and the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the hydronium ion, $H_3O^+$, which has a pyramidal ($C_{3v}$) geometry.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of valence electrons.**\nOxygen is in Group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\nHydrogen is in Group 1, so each H atom has 1 valence electron.\nThe species has a +1 charge, which means one electron is removed from the neutral count.\nTotal valence electrons = (1 * O) + (3 * H) - 1 = 6 + 3(1) - 1 = 8 electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the symmetry of the central atom's (Oxygen) valence orbitals.**\nThe basis set for oxygen is the 2s and 2p orbitals. We use the $C_{3v}$ character table to find their irreducible representations.\n- The 2s orbital is spherically symmetric, so it always transforms as the totally symmetric representation, which is $A_1$ in any point group. So, O(2s) has $a_1$ symmetry.\n- The 2p orbitals are treated as vectors. The $p_z$ orbital lies along the principal axis ($z$-axis). From the character table, the function $z$ transforms as $A_1$. So, O($2p_z$) has $a_1$ symmetry.\n- The ($p_x, p_y$) orbitals transform together as a degenerate pair. The character table shows that $(x, y)$ transforms as the $E$ representation. So, O($2p_x, 2p_y$) have $e$ symmetry.\nIn summary, the valence orbitals of the central oxygen atom provide symmetries: $2a_1 + e$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the symmetry of the ligand group orbitals (Symmetry Adapted Linear Combinations, or SALCs).**\nThe ligands are the three hydrogen atoms, and the basis set is their 1s orbitals. To find the symmetries of the SALCs, we determine the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}_{1s}}$, by applying the symmetry operations of the $C_{3v}$ group to the three H 1s orbitals and counting how many remain in their original position.\n- $E$: The identity operation leaves all 3 H atoms unshifted. The character is $\\chi(E) = 3$.\n- $C_3$: A rotation by 120 degrees about the principal axis moves all H atoms to new positions. The character is $\\chi(C_3) = 0$.\n- $\\sigma_v$: A reflection through a vertical mirror plane that contains one O-H bond leaves that one H atom unshifted, while the other two are interchanged. The character is $\\chi(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\nSo, the reducible representation for the H 1s orbitals is $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}_{1s}} = (3, 0, 1)$.\n\nNow, we reduce this representation to its constituent irreducible representations using the formula:\n$n(\\text{Irr}) = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{\\text{classes}} N \\cdot \\chi_R \\cdot \\chi_I$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group (for $C_{3v}$, $h=1+2+3=6$), $N$ is the number of operations in the class, $\\chi_R$ is the character of the reducible representation, and $\\chi_I$ is the character of the irreducible representation.\n\n- $n(A_1) = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(1)] = \\frac{1}{6}[3+0+3] = 1$.\n- $n(A_2) = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{6}[3+0-3] = 0$.\n- $n(E) = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(3)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{6}[6+0+0] = 1$.\n\nThus, the H 1s orbitals combine to form SALCs with symmetries $a_1 + e$.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Molecular Orbital (MO) diagram.**\nWe combine atomic orbitals and SALCs of the same symmetry to form bonding and antibonding MOs.\n- **$a_1$ symmetry:** We have two $a_1$ orbitals from Oxygen (2s and $2p_z$) and one $a_1$ SALC from the hydrogens. These three orbitals will combine to form three MOs of $a_1$ symmetry. In order of increasing energy, these are a strongly bonding MO ($1a_1$), a largely non-bonding MO ($2a_1$), and a strongly antibonding MO ($3a_1^*$).\n- **$e$ symmetry:** We have one set of $e$ orbitals from Oxygen ($2p_x, 2p_y$) and one set of $e$ SALCs from the hydrogens. These will combine to form a degenerate pair of bonding MOs ($1e$) and a degenerate pair of antibonding MOs ($2e^*$).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the energy ordering of the MOs and fill with electrons.**\nThe energy ordering for pyramidal $XY_3$ molecules like $NH_3$ and $H_3O^+$ is well-established. The bonding orbitals are lowest in energy, followed by the non-bonding orbital, and then the antibonding orbitals.\n- The lowest energy MO is the $1a_1$ bonding orbital, formed from the in-phase combination of the O 2s and the $a_1$ H SALC.\n- The next lowest are the degenerate $1e$ bonding orbitals, from the O 2p and $e$ H SALCs.\n- The next orbital is the $2a_1$ orbital. This is largely a non-bonding orbital, primarily composed of the O $2p_z$ orbital, which points away from the hydrogen atoms. This is the lone pair orbital.\n- Higher in energy are the antibonding orbitals, $2e^*$ and $3a_1^*$.\n\nThe energy order for the occupied and low-lying unoccupied orbitals is: $1a_1 < 1e < 2a_1 < 2e^* < \\dots$\n\nNow, we fill these orbitals with the 8 valence electrons:\n- The $1a_1$ orbital holds 2 electrons: $(1a_1)^2$.\n- The degenerate $1e$ orbitals hold 4 electrons: $(1e)^4$.\n- The $2a_1$ orbital holds the remaining 2 electrons: $(2a_1)^2$.\n\nThe final ground-state valence electron configuration is $(1a_1)^2 (1e)^4 (2a_1)^2$. The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is the last orbital to be filled, which is the $2a_1$ orbital.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given options.**\n- A. The ground-state configuration is $(1a_1)^2 (1e)^4 (2a_1)^2$. The HOMO is the $2a_1$ orbital. This matches our derivation.\n- B. The ground-state configuration is $(1a_1)^2 (2a_1)^2 (1e)^4$. The HOMO is the $1e$ orbital. This incorrectly places the non-bonding $2a_1$ orbital below the bonding $1e$ set.\n- C. The ground-state configuration is $(1a_1')^2 (1e')^4 (1a_2'')^2$. The HOMO is the $1a_2''$ orbital. This uses symmetry labels for the $D_{3h}$ point group, which would correspond to a planar geometry, not the stated pyramidal geometry.\n- D. The ground-state configuration is $(1a_1)^2 (1e)^4$. The HOMO is the $1e$ orbital. This uses only 6 valence electrons instead of the correct 8.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer. The MO description is very similar to the isoelectronic ammonia molecule ($NH_3$), which also has the configuration $(1a_1)^2 (1e)^4 (2a_1)^2$ and a HOMO of $a_1$ symmetry corresponding to its lone pair. The primary difference is that the orbitals of $H_3O^+$ are all lower in energy than their counterparts in $NH_3$ due to the greater nuclear charge of oxygen and the overall positive charge of the ion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2272531"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple two-center bonds, MO theory elegantly explains more complex bonding scenarios, such as in the linear triiodide ion, $I_3^-$.
