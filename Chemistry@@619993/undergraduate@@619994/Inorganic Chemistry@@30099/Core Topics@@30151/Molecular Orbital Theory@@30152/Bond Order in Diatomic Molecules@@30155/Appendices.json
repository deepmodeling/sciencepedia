Bond Order = 1.0, Paramagnetic", "solution": "To determine the bond order and magnetic properties of the superoxide ion, $O_2^-$, we must construct its molecular orbital (MO) diagram and fill it with the appropriate number of valence electrons.\n\nFirst, we count the total number of valence electrons. A neutral oxygen atom (O) is in Group 16 of the periodic table and has 6 valence electrons. The superoxide ion, $O_2^-$, consists of two oxygen atoms and has a net charge of -1, meaning it has one extra electron compared to a neutral dioxygen molecule ($O_2$).\nTotal valence electrons = (2 atoms $\\times$ 6 valence electrons/atom) + 1 extra electron = 13 electrons.\n\nNext, we write the energy level ordering for the molecular orbitals of a second-period homonuclear diatomic molecule like $O_2$. For oxygen and heavier elements in the period, the $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital is lower in energy than the $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals. The ordering is:\n$$ \\sigma_{2s} < \\sigma^*_{2s} < \\sigma_{2p} < \\pi_{2p} < \\pi^*_{2p} < \\sigma^*_{2p} $$\nNote that the $\\pi_{2p}$ and $\\pi^*_{2p}$ levels are each composed of two degenerate orbitals.\n\nNow, we fill these orbitals with the 13 valence electrons according to the Aufbau principle and Hund's rule, which states that electrons will occupy degenerate orbitals singly before pairing up.\n\n1.  The $\\sigma_{2s}$ orbital is filled with 2 electrons.\n2.  The $\\sigma^*_{2s}$ orbital is filled with 2 electrons.\n3.  The $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital is filled with 2 electrons.\n4.  The degenerate $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals are filled with 4 electrons (2 in each).\n5.  This accounts for $2+2+2+4 = 10$ electrons. We have 3 electrons remaining.\n6.  These 3 electrons are placed in the degenerate $\\pi^*_{2p}$ orbitals. Following Hund's rule, one orbital gets 2 electrons (paired), and the other gets 1 electron (unpaired).\n\nThe resulting electron configuration for the valence shell of $O_2^-$ is:\n$$ (\\sigma_{2s})^{2} (\\sigma^{*}_{2s})^{2} (\\sigma_{2p})^{2} (\\pi_{2p})^{4} (\\pi^{*}_{2p})^{3} $$\nMore explicitly, the filling of the $\\pi^*_{2p}$ level is $(\\pi^*_{2p_x})^2 (\\pi^*_{2p_y})^1$ or vice-versa.\n\nThe bond order is calculated using the formula:\n$$ \\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\text{Number of electrons in bonding MOs} - \\text{Number of electrons in antibonding MOs}) $$\n\nBonding MOs are those without an asterisk: $\\sigma_{2s}$, $\\sigma_{2p}$, $\\pi_{2p}$.\nNumber of bonding electrons = $2 + 2 + 4 = 8$.\n\nAntibonding MOs are those with an asterisk: $\\sigma^*_{2s}$, $\\pi^*_{2p}$.\nNumber of antibonding electrons = $2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nNow, we calculate the bond order:\n$$ \\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{1}{2} (8 - 5) = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 $$\n\nThe magnetic property is determined by the presence of unpaired electrons. A species is paramagnetic if it has one or more unpaired electrons, and diamagnetic if all its electrons are paired. Looking at the electron configuration, specifically the $\\pi^*_{2p}$ level, we see $(\\pi^*_{2p_x})^2 (\\pi^*_{2p_y})^1$. There is one unpaired electron. Therefore, the superoxide ion, $O_2^-$, is paramagnetic.\n\nCombining these two results, the bond order of $O_2^-$ is 1.5 and it is paramagnetic.
