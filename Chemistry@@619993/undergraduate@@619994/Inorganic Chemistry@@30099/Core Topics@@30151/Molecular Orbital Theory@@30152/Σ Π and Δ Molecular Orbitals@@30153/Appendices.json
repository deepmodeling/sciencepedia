We begin our practice with the helium hydride ion, $HeH^+$, a species of great astrophysical interest. This exercise [@problem_id:2050012] provides a perfect entry point into constructing MO diagrams, as it involves the simplest case—the interaction of two $1s$ atomic orbitals—while also introducing the important concept of how differing atomic orbital energies in heteronuclear species affect the resulting molecular orbitals.", "problem": "Consider the molecular ion, helium hydride (HeH$^+$), which is thought to be one of the first molecular species to form in the early universe after the Big Bang. This ion is composed of one helium atom and one hydrogen atom, and possesses a total net charge of +1.\n\nTo analyze the bonding in this ion, we use the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) method. You should consider only the valence atomic orbitals, which are the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atom and the 1s orbital of the helium atom. A key piece of information is that due to the higher nuclear charge of helium ($Z=2$) compared to hydrogen ($Z=1$), the 1s atomic orbital of helium is at a significantly lower energy level than the 1s atomic orbital of hydrogen.\n\nUsing this information, construct a qualitative molecular orbital energy diagram for HeH$^+$ and determine its bond order. Your final answer should be the numerical value of the bond order.", "solution": "We identify the valence atomic orbitals to be combined: the $1s$ orbital on hydrogen and the $1s$ orbital on helium. The problem states that the helium $1s$ orbital lies at significantly lower energy than the hydrogen $1s$ orbital because helium has higher nuclear charge, with $Z_{\\text{He}}=2$ and $Z_{\\text{H}}=1$.\n\nFirst, determine the total number of electrons in HeH$^{+}$. Using atomic numbers and the net charge,\n$$\nN_{e^{-}} = Z_{\\text{He}} + Z_{\\text{H}} - 1 = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.\n$$\nThus, there are $2$ electrons to place in molecular orbitals.\n\nNext, form molecular orbitals by the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) method. Combining two $1s$ atomic orbitals yields two molecular orbitals:\n- a lower-energy bonding orbital, denoted $\\sigma_{1s}$, arising from constructive interference of the $1s$ AOs;\n- a higher-energy antibonding orbital, denoted $\\sigma_{1s}^{*}$, arising from destructive interference.\n\nBecause the helium $1s$ AO is much lower in energy than the hydrogen $1s$ AO, the bonding $\\sigma_{1s}$ orbital is strongly weighted toward He $1s$ character and the antibonding $\\sigma_{1s}^{*}$ orbital is strongly weighted toward H $1s$ character. Nevertheless, there remain exactly two MOs from the two AOs, one bonding and one antibonding, separated in energy.\n\nApply the Aufbau principle and the Pauli exclusion principle to place the $2$ electrons in the available MOs. Both electrons occupy the lowest-energy MO, the bonding $\\sigma_{1s}$, with opposite spins, leaving the antibonding $\\sigma_{1s}^{*}$ empty.

This practice [@problem_id:2049975] focuses on the diatomic boron molecule, $B_2$, and demonstrates one of the key predictive successes of MO theory: its ability to explain the molecule's paramagnetism, a property that simpler bonding models fail to predict. By correctly applying the MO energy level ordering for early second-period elements and Hund's rule, you will see how MO theory provides deep insight into electronic structure and magnetic properties.", "problem": "Experimental measurements have shown that the diatomic boron molecule, $B_2$, is paramagnetic, meaning it is weakly attracted to a magnetic field. This property arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in the molecule. According to Molecular Orbital (MO) theory, the electronic structure of a molecule determines its magnetic properties. For homonuclear diatomic molecules of the second period elements up to and including nitrogen (i.e., $Li_2$ through $N_2$), the energy ordering of the molecular orbitals derived from the 2p atomic orbitals is π$_{2p}$ followed by σ$_{2p}$.\n\nBased on this information and the principles of MO theory, which of the following statements correctly explains the paramagnetism of the $B_2$ molecule?\n\nA.
