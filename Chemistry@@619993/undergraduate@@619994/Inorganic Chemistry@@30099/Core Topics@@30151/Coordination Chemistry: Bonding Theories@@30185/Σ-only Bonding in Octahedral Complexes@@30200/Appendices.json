This practice moves beyond a simple focus on d-orbitals to account for all valence electrons contributed by both the central metal and the six sigma-donating ligands. By constructing and populating the complete set of sigma-bonding, non-bonding, and anti-bonding molecular orbitals, we can calculate the average metal-ligand bond order, a fundamental descriptor of chemical bonding [@problem_id:2301372].", "problem": "A chemist synthesizes an octahedral complex, $[V(L)_6]^{5+}$, where the central vanadium atom is in the +5 oxidation state. The ligand, L, is a simple, neutral, monodentate species that contributes two electrons to form a single σ-bond with the metal center. For the purpose of analyzing the electronic structure of this complex, you are to construct a simplified molecular orbital model considering only σ-interactions between the metal's valence orbitals ($3d$, $4s$, $4p$) and the six ligand σ-orbitals. Based on the electron population of the resulting molecular orbitals, calculate the average bond order for a single vanadium-ligand (V-L) bond.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must first construct a molecular orbital (MO) diagram for the octahedral complex $[V(L)_6]^{5+}$ considering only σ-interactions, then populate it with the correct number of valence electrons, and finally calculate the bond order.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of valence electrons.**\nThe complex is $[V(L)_6]^{5+}$.\nThe vanadium atom is in Group 5 of the periodic table, so a neutral V atom has 5 valence electrons (configuration $[Ar] 3d^3 4s^2$).\nThe oxidation state of vanadium is +5. This means the vanadium ion is $V^{5+}$. To form this ion, the neutral atom loses all 5 of its valence electrons. Therefore, the $d$-electron count for the $V^{5+}$ ion is $d^0$.\nThe ligand L is a neutral, two-electron σ-donor. Since there are six ligands, they contribute a total of $6 \\times 2 = 12$ electrons to the metal-ligand bonding.\nThe total number of valence electrons to be placed in the MO diagram is the sum of electrons from the metal ion and the ligands:\nTotal electrons = (electrons from $V^{5+}$) + (electrons from 6 L) = $0 + 12 = 12$ electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the qualitative σ-only MO diagram for an octahedral complex.**\nIn an octahedral ($O_h$) environment, the metal's valence atomic orbitals (AOs) and the six ligand σ-orbitals (treated as a group, or Ligand Group Orbitals, LGOs) are classified by their symmetry.\n\n-   **Metal AOs:**\n    -   $4s$ orbital has $a_{1g}$ symmetry.\n    -   $4p$ orbitals ($p_x, p_y, p_z$) as a set have $t_{1u}$ symmetry.\n    -   $3d$ orbitals split into two sets: ($d_{x^2-y^2}, d_{z^2}$) have $e_g$ symmetry, and ($d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$) have $t_{2g}$ symmetry.\n\n-   **Ligand Group Orbitals (LGOs) for σ-bonding:**\n    -   The six ligand σ-orbitals combine to form LGOs with symmetries that can overlap with the metal AOs along the M-L bond axes. These symmetries are $a_{1g}$, $t_{1u}$, and $e_g$.\n\n-   **MO Formation:**\n    -   The metal's $a_{1g}$ ($s$) orbital combines with the ligands' $a_{1g}$ LGO to form a bonding MO ($a_{1g}$) and an antibonding MO ($a_{1g}^*$).\n    -   The metal's $t_{1u}$ ($p$) orbitals combine with the ligands' $t_{1u}$ LGOs to form a set of three degenerate bonding MOs ($t_{1u}$) and three degenerate antibonding MOs ($t_{1u}^*$).\n    -   The metal's $e_g$ ($d$) orbitals combine with the ligands' $e_g$ LGOs to form a set of two degenerate bonding MOs ($e_g$) and two degenerate antibonding MOs ($e_g^*$).\n    -   The metal's $t_{2g}$ ($d$) orbitals have no corresponding σ-LGOs to interact with, so they remain as non-bonding orbitals in the final MO diagram.\n\nThe relative energy ordering of the resulting MOs (from lowest to highest) is typically:\n$a_{1g}$ (bonding), $t_{1u}$ (bonding), $e_g$ (bonding) < $t_{2g}$ (non-bonding) < $e_g^*$ (antibonding), $a_{1g}^*$ (antibonding), $t_{1u}^*$ (antibonding).\n\n**Step 3: Populate the MOs with electrons.**\nWe have 12 valence electrons to fill into the MOs, starting from the lowest energy levels.\n-   The $a_{1g}$ bonding MO can hold 2 electrons.\n-   The triply degenerate $t_{1u}$ bonding MOs can hold $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons.\n-   The doubly degenerate $e_g$ bonding MOs can hold $2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons.\n\nTotal electrons placed = $2 + 6 + 4 = 12$.\nAll 12 electrons occupy the bonding MOs. The non-bonding ($t_{2g}$) and all antibonding MOs ($e_g^*, a_{1g}^*, t_{1u}^*$) are empty.\n-   Number of electrons in bonding MOs ($N_b$) = 12.\n-   Number of electrons in antibonding MOs ($N_a$) = 0.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the bond order.**\nThe overall bond order for the entire complex is given by the formula:\nOverall Bond Order = $\\frac{1}{2} (N_b - N_a)$\nOverall Bond Order = $\\frac{1}{2} (12 - 0) = 6$.\n\nThis value represents the total bonding distributed across all six metal-ligand bonds. The problem asks for the *average* bond order for a single V-L bond. To find this, we divide the overall bond order by the number of ligands (which is 6).\n\nAverage V-L Bond Order = $\\frac{\\text{Overall Bond Order}}{\\text{Number of Ligands}} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1$.\n\nThis result makes chemical sense, as each ligand is forming a single σ-bond with the metal center in this simplified model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2301372"}, {"introduction": "With the overall sigma-bonding picture established, we can now zoom in on the d-electrons, which are responsible for the unique magnetic and spectroscopic properties of transition metal complexes.
