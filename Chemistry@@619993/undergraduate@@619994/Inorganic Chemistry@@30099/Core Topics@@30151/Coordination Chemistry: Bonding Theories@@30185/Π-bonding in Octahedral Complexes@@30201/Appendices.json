In an ideal octahedral ligand field, the five $d$ orbitals split into a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy $e_{g}$ set, with splitting magnitude defined as\n$$\n\\Delta_{o} \\equiv E(e_{g}) - E(t_{2g}).\n$$\nFor a given metal ion, $\\Delta_{o}$ depends on the ligand field strength arising from metal-ligand interactions. Two key contributions are:\n- $\\sigma$-donation from the ligand to the metal, which increases the antibonding character and energy of the $e_{g}$ orbitals, thereby increasing $\\Delta_{o}$.\n- $\\pi$ interactions: \n  - $\\pi$-acceptor ligands accept electron density via backbonding from the metal $t_{2g}$ orbitals into ligand $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, stabilizing (lowering) the $t_{2g}$ energy.

Both the cyanide ligand ($\\text{CN}^−$) and the carbon monoxide ligand ($\\text{CO}$) are strong-field ligands that can participate in π-backbonding, where electron density from the metal's $d$-orbitals is donated into the ligand's empty π-antibonding orbitals.

The crystal field splitting energy, $\\Delta_o$, is greater for $\\text{[Fe(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{4-}$ than for $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$ because the cyanide ligand is anionic, leading to stronger electrostatic interactions.\nB.

The extent of π-backbonding is greater in $\\text{[Fe(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{4-}$ because the higher negative charge on the complex makes the $Fe^{2+}$ center more electron-rich and thus a better π-donor.\nE. The Fe-C bond in $\\text{[Fe(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{4-}$ is significantly stronger and shorter than the Cr-C bond in $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$ due to the formal $+2$ charge on the iron center compared to the formal $0$ charge on chromium.", "solution": "We compare the two isoelectronic octahedral $d^{6}$ complexes $\\text{[Fe(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{4-}$ and $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$ using molecular orbital considerations.\n\n1) Electron configurations and ligand field splitting.\n- For strong-field octahedral ligands, a $d^{6}$ metal adopts the low-spin configuration $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$. Define the octahedral splitting as $\\Delta_{o} = E(e_{g}) - E(t_{2g})$.\n- In the MO picture, $\\sigma$ donation from the ligand raises the $e_{g}$ set (metal-ligand $\\sigma$ antibonding). $\\pi$ backbonding corresponds to donation from the metal $t_{2g}$ orbitals into ligand $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, which stabilizes $t_{2g}$ (lowers its energy). Therefore, stronger $\\pi$-acceptor ligands both lower $E(t_{2g})$ and increase $\\Delta_{o}$.\n\n2) Relative $\\pi$-acceptor abilities and consequences.\n- The ligand $\\text{CO}$ has lower-lying $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals and is a stronger $\\pi$-acceptor than $\\text{CN}^{-}$. In second-order perturbation terms, the stabilization of $t_{2g}$ due to mixing with ligand $\\pi^{*}$ is approximately\n$$\n\\Delta E(t_{2g}) \\approx -\\frac{V_{\\pi}^{2}}{\\Delta_{\\pi}},\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\pi}$ is the metal-ligand $\\pi$ coupling and $\\Delta_{\\pi} = E(\\pi^{*}) - E(t_{2g})$. A smaller $\\Delta_{\\pi}$ (as for CO) yields a larger negative shift, i.e., a lower $E(t_{2g})$.\n- Consequently, $E(t_{2g})$ is lower in $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$ than in $\\text{[Fe(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{4-}$, and because $e_{g}$ is antibonding with respect to $\\sigma$ donation while $t_{2g}$ is further stabilized by stronger $\\pi$ backbonding, the overall $\\Delta_{o}$ is larger for $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$.\n\n3) Oxidation state and backbonding.\n- Backbonding increases as the metal becomes more electron rich and the ligand $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals are lower in energy. Although $\\text{[Fe(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{4-}$ is an anionic complex, the metal is $Fe^{2+}$ (higher oxidation state) while $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$ has $Cr^{0}$ (lower oxidation state), which generally favors greater backbonding in the carbonyl complex. Together with CO being the stronger $\\pi$-acceptor, the extent of $\\pi$ backbonding is greater in $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$.\n\n4) Internal ligand bond orders.\n- $\\pi$ backbonding populates ligand $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, reducing the internal ligand bond order. Because $\\text{CO}$ is the stronger $\\pi$-acceptor and receives greater backbonding in $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$, the C-O bond order is reduced more in $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$ than the C-N bond order is in $\\text{[Fe(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{4-}$. Therefore, any claim that the coordinated C-O bond has a higher bond order than the coordinated C-N bond is not supported.\n\nEvaluation of statements:\n- A is incorrect: ligand charge does not by itself dictate $\\Delta_{o}$; CO, although neutral, is stronger field than $\\text{CN}^{-}$.\n- B is incorrect: stronger backbonding to $\\text{CO}$ lowers the C-O bond order more, not less.\n- C is correct: $E(t_{2g})$ is lower and $\\Delta_{o}$ is larger for $\\text{_Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$ due to stronger $\\pi$-acceptor character of $\\text{CO}$ and greater backbonding at $Cr^{0}$.\n- D is incorrect: greater backbonding occurs in $\\text{[Cr(CO)}_6\\text{]}$, not in $\\text{[Fe(CN)}_6\\text{]}^{4-}$.\n- E is incorrect: metal-carbon bonds in carbonyls are typically strengthened by synergic bonding at low metal oxidation state; the stated rationale is opposite to established MO reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate comparison is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2300844"}]}
