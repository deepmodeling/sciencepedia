They learn about two important ligand-dependent phenomena: the spectrochemical series, which ranks ligands based on the magnitude of the crystal field splitting energy ($\\Delta_o$) they produce, and the nephelauxetic series, which ranks ligands based on their ability to decrease the inter-electron repulsion among the d-electrons of the central metal ion. This reduction in repulsion is quantified by the nephelauxetic ratio, $\\beta = \\frac{B_{complex}}{B_{free-ion}}$, where $B$ is the Racah inter-electron repulsion parameter. A smaller value of $\\beta$ signifies a greater reduction in electron repulsion and thus a stronger nephelauxetic effect.\n\nBased on their understanding, the student proposes a unifying hypothesis: \"A ligand that is a stronger-field ligand (i.e., causes a larger $\\Delta_o$) must also cause a stronger nephelauxetic effect (i.e., cause a smaller $\\beta$).\"\n\nTo test this hypothesis, consider the ligands water ($H_2O$) and ammonia ($NH_3$). For a wide range of metal ions, it is experimentally observed that ammonia is a stronger-field ligand than water. For a representative $M^{3+}$ ion, the following parameters are measured:\n- For $[M(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$, the nephelauxetic ratio is $\\beta_{H_2O} = 0.74$.\n- For $[M(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$, the nephelauxetic ratio is $\\beta_{NH_3} = 0.76$.\n\nBased on this information and the principles of ligand field theory, which of the following statements provides the most accurate evaluation of the student's hypothesis?\n\nA.

The hypothesis is incorrect. Water is the stronger-field ligand, and it also produces a stronger nephelauxetic effect, which contradicts the student's premise about ammonia.\n\nE.

It is quantified by the reduction of the Racah parameter, $B$, which measures inter-electron repulsion in the metal's d-orbitals.

The tetrahedral complex has $B = 730 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and the octahedral complex has $B = 690 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.

The tetrahedral complex has $B = 690 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and the octahedral complex has $B = 730 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.

The tetrahedral complex has $B = 690 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and the octahedral complex has $B = 730 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.

The tetrahedral complex has $B = 730 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and the octahedral complex has $B = 690 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. This is because the larger crystal field splitting energy ($\\Delta_o$) in the octahedral complex is the direct cause of the greater reduction in inter-electron repulsion.\n\nE.
