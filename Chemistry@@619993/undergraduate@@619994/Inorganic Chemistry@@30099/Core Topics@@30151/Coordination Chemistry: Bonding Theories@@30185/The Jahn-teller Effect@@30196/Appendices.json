In octahedral complexes, electronic degeneracy arises from uneven occupancy within the $e_{g}$ or $t_{2g}$ sets.

In octahedral complexes, the strongest Jahn-Teller distortions arise when the $e_{g}$ set is unevenly occupied (e.g., $e_g^1$ or $e_g^3$), because $e_g$ orbitals ($d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$) point directly at ligands and are strongly antibonding. This typically leads to a significant tetragonal elongation or compression.\n\nFor the high-spin $d^7$ case, the $e_g$ set is evenly occupied with one electron in each $e_g$ orbital, so there is no first-order Jahn-Teller driving force from the $e_g$ manifold. However, the $t_{2g}^5$ configuration is orbitally degenerate in the $t_{2g}$ set (equivalently, it can be viewed as $t_{2g}^1$ with a hole), which can produce a Jahn-Teller effect. Because $t_{2g}$ orbitals do not point directly at ligands and are less antibonding, the associated Jahn-Teller distortion is typically weak. The usual outcome is a slight tetragonal distortion (elongation or compression) along a four-fold axis that lifts the residual $t_{2g}$-derived degeneracy:\n$$\nO_h \\to D_{4h}, \\quad t_{2g} \\to b_{2g} + e_g, \\quad e_g \\to a_{1g} + b_{1g}.\n$$\nThus, a weak geometric distortion is expected rather than a strong distortion, a perfect octahedron, a wholesale rearrangement to trigonal prismatic geometry, or a spin-state change (especially since water is a weak-field ligand favoring high spin).\n\nTherefore, the correct expectation is a weak Jahn-Teller distortion with slight elongation or compression along a four-fold axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294593"}, {"introduction": "The Jahn-Teller theorem not only predicts a distortion but also explains its energetic benefit by showing how the d-orbitals split in energy.

For a $d^9$ metal center, the ideal-octahedral filling is $(t_{2g})^6(e_g)^3$, which is electronically degenerate in the $e_g$ level. By the Jahn–Teller theorem, this degeneracy is removed by a symmetry-lowering distortion.\n\nFor a tetragonal elongation along the $z$ axis, the axial metal–ligand distances increase. This reduces electrostatic repulsion for orbitals with $z$ character and increases relative repulsion for orbitals oriented toward the equatorial ligands, while preserving the crystal-field barycenter.
