Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm that the complex has a tetrahedral geometry and exists in a high-spin electronic state. Based on Crystal Field Theory, calculate the Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE) for this complex.

By conservation of the barycenter and the definition of the tetrahedral splitting parameter $\\Delta_t$, the orbital energies relative to the spherical-field average are\n$$\nE(e) = -\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_t, \\quad E(t_{2}) = +\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_t,\n$$\nsince $2E(e)+3E(t_{2})=0$.\n\nFor a $d^{7}$ high-spin tetrahedral complex, Hund’s rule and the small $\\Delta_t$ imply that electrons maximize the number of unpaired spins before pairing. The occupancy proceeds by placing one electron in each of the five d orbitals (two $e$ and three $t_{2}$), and the remaining two electrons then pair in the lower-energy $e$ orbitals. Therefore, the electron configuration is $e^{4}t_{2}^{3}$.\n\nThe ligand field stabilization energy (LFSE) is the sum of the energies of the occupied orbitals relative to the barycenter:\n$$\n\\text{LFSE} = 4\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_t\\right) + 3\\left(+\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_t\\right)\n= \\left(-\\frac{12}{5} + \\frac{6}{5}\\right)\\Delta_t\n= -\\frac{6}{5}\\Delta_t\n= -1.2\\,\\Delta_t.\n$$\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2244101"}, {"introduction": "The electronic configuration dictated by the crystal field has direct, measurable physical consequences, one of which is magnetism.

The tetrahedral splitting $\\Delta_t$ is smaller than the electron pairing energy, so tetrahedral complexes are typically high spin.
