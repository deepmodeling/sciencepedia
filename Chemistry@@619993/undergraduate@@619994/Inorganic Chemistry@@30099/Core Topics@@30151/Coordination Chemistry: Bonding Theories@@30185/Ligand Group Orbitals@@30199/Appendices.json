This approach treats the relevant atomic orbitals of the ligands as a collective set and generates symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) that can interact with the metal's valence orbitals.\n\nConsider a generic trans-disubstituted octahedral complex with the formula $[MA_{4}B_{2}]$, where M is a central metal and A and B are two different monodentate ligands. This complex belongs to the $D_{4h}$ point group. The four 'A' ligands occupy the equatorial positions (in the $xy$-plane), and the two 'B' ligands occupy the axial positions (along the $z$-axis).\n\nWhen generating the LGOs for the sigma-bonding framework of this complex, it is standard procedure to treat the four 'A' ligands and the two 'B' ligands as two distinct sets, generating a separate reducible representation for each set. Which of the following statements provides the correct and fundamental group-theoretical reason for this separation?\n\nA. The set of four 'A' ligands and the set of two 'B' ligands are symmetry-inequivalent; no symmetry operation of the $D_{4h}$ point group can transform an 'A' ligand into a 'B' ligand, or vice versa. Therefore, they form two independent basis sets.\n\nB. The ligand donor orbitals of 'A' and 'B' have different intrinsic energies due to their different chemical identities (e.g., electronegativity). The LGOs must be separated to reflect this energy difference.\n\nC. The symmetry of the metal's $d$-orbitals in a $D_{4h}$ environment splits into multiple irreducible representations. The ligand sets must be separated from the start to ensure they generate LGOs that match the symmetry of these different metal orbitals.\n\nD. The four equatorial 'A' ligands lie in the horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$), whereas the two axial 'B' ligands lie on the principal $C_4$ rotation axis. Since these symmetry elements are distinct, the ligands associated with them must be treated separately.\n\nE. The total number of ligands is six, and constructing a single $6 \\times 6$ matrix representation for all ligands is computationally more complex than constructing separate $4 \\times 4$ and $2 \\times 2$ representations.", "solution": "The question asks for the fundamental reason, based on group theory, for treating the equatorial 'A' ligands and axial 'B' ligands as separate sets when constructing Ligand Group Orbitals (LGOs) for a $\\text{trans-}[\\text{MA}_4\\text{B}_2]$ complex. Let's analyze the principles of group theory as applied to molecular orbitals.\n\nThe core principle for creating Symmetry-Adapted Linear Combinations (SALCs), such as LGOs, is the identification of basis sets. A basis set is a collection of atoms, orbitals, or vectors that are permuted (interchanged) only among themselves by the symmetry operations of the molecule's point group. Any member of the set can be transformed into any other member of the set through one or more of the group's symmetry operations. If two sets of atoms cannot be interconverted, they are considered symmetry-inequivalent and must be treated as independent basis sets, each generating its own reducible representation.\n\nLet's apply this to the $\\text{trans-}[\\text{MA}_4\\text{B}_2]$ complex, which has $D_{4h}$ symmetry.\nThe four 'A' ligands are located in the equatorial plane. Let's label their positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nThe two 'B' ligands are located in the axial positions. Let's label their positions 5 (top) and 6 (bottom).\n\nNow, consider the effect of the symmetry operations of the $D_{4h}$ point group:\n- A $C_4$ rotation about the $z$-axis will permute the 'A' ligands among positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. It will leave the 'B' ligands in positions 5 and 6 untouched.\n- The inversion operation, $i$, will interchange A(1) with A(3), A(2) with A(4), and B(5) with B(6).\n- A $C_2$ rotation perpendicular to the principal axis will interchange some 'A' ligands and will also interchange the two 'B' ligands.\n- A reflection through the horizontal plane, $\\sigma_h$, will leave all 'A' ligands in place and reflect B(5) into B(6).\n\nIn every case, applying any symmetry operation of the $D_{4h}$ group will only ever move an 'A' ligand to a position previously occupied by another 'A' ligand. Similarly, a 'B' ligand can only be moved to a position previously occupied by a 'B' ligand. Crucially, there is no symmetry operation in the $D_{4h}$ group that can move an 'A' ligand to a 'B' ligand's position or vice-versa.\n\nBecause the set of 'A' ligands and the set of 'B' ligands do not interconvert, they form two distinct, symmetry-inequivalent sets. According to the principles of group theory, each of these sets must be used as a separate basis to generate a separate reducible representation ($\\Gamma_A$ and $\\Gamma_B$). These representations can then be reduced independently to find the symmetries of the LGOs arising from each set.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\nA. This statement correctly identifies that the 'A' and 'B' ligand sets are symmetry-inequivalent because no operation transforms a member of one set into a member of the other. It correctly concludes that they must form independent basis sets. This is the fundamental group-theoretical reason.\n\nB. This statement discusses the intrinsic orbital energies. While it is true that different ligands have different orbital energies, and this fact is crucial for determining the final energies and mixing coefficients in the MO diagram, it is not the *group-theoretical* reason for separating the sets. Group theory deals with symmetry and geometry, not with energy levels. The separation would be necessary even if A and B were isotopes of the same element with identical orbital energies, simply because of their inequivalent positions in the `trans` geometry.\n\nC. This statement inverts the logic of the LGO-MO process. We first determine the symmetries of the LGOs and *then* see which metal orbitals they can combine with based on matching symmetry. We do not separate the ligand sets *because* the metal orbitals are split; we separate the ligand sets because they are symmetry-inequivalent.\n\nD. This statement makes a correct observation about the geometry ('A' ligands in $\\sigma_h$, 'B' ligands on $C_4$) but fails to connect it to the core principle of interchangeability. Simply being associated with different symmetry elements isn't the formal reason. The fundamental reason is that the entire set of 'A's does not mix with the entire set of 'B's under any operation. This option describes a symptom, not the underlying cause.\n\nE. This statement refers to computational complexity. While it might be true that smaller matrices are easier to handle, this is a practical convenience, not a fundamental requirement of group theory. The method is based on the mathematical structure of the group and basis sets, not on computational shortcuts.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that provides the correct and fundamental reason from the perspective of group theory is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2265471"}]}
