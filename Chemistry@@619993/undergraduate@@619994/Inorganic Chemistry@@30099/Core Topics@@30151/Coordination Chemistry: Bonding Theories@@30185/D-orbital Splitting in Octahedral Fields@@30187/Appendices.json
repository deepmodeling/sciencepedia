{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of understanding transition metal complexes is predicting their electronic structure. This structure dictates many observable properties, most notably magnetism. This exercise focuses on a \"high-spin\" scenario, where the electrostatic repulsion from pairing electrons outweighs the energy gap, $\\Delta_o$, created by the ligand field. Mastering this allows you to determine the number of unpaired electrons, a direct measure of a complex's paramagnetic character, which is crucial in applications like the design of MRI contrast agents [@problem_id:2243523].", "id": "2243523", "problem": "In the development of new contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), complexes of paramagnetic metal ions are often synthesized and studied. One such candidate is a coordination complex where a central iron(III) ion, $Fe^{3+}$, is surrounded by six ligands in an octahedral geometry. Spectroscopic measurements reveal that this complex exhibits high-spin behavior, meaning the electrons preferentially occupy higher energy orbitals before pairing up in lower energy orbitals. Based on this information, determine the total number of unpaired electrons in the d-orbitals of the central $Fe^{3+}$ ion in this high-spin octahedral complex.\n\n", "solution": "The neutral iron atom has the ground-state electron configuration $[Ar]\\,3d^{6}4s^{2}$. Formation of $Fe^{3+}$ removes electrons first from the $4s$ orbital and then from the $3d$ orbitals due to their relative energies in the ion, so the configuration becomes $[Ar]\\,3d^{5}$.\n\nIn an octahedral ligand field, the five $d$ orbitals split into the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set and the higher-energy $e_{g}$ set, with an energy separation denoted by $\\Delta_{o}$. For a high-spin complex, the pairing energy $P$ exceeds the crystal field splitting, so electrons occupy different orbitals with parallel spins before pairing, according to Hund’s rule.\n\nFor a $d^{5}$ ion in a high-spin octahedral field, the electrons distribute as $t_{2g}^{3}e_{g}^{2}$ with one electron in each of the five $d$ orbitals, all unpaired. Therefore, the total number of unpaired electrons is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply arranging electrons, Crystal Field Theory provides a powerful tool for quantifying the energetic effects of d-orbital splitting. This is accomplished by calculating the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE), a measure of the net stabilization gained by a complex compared to a hypothetical spherical field. This practice [@problem_id:2243530] provides a clear-cut case for calculating the CFSE for a $d^8$ metal ion, where the electron configuration is unambiguous regardless of ligand strength, solidifying your understanding of the energetic contributions of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals.", "id": "2243530", "problem": "In the framework of Crystal Field Theory, the five degenerate d-orbitals of a transition metal ion are split into different energy levels upon the formation of a coordination complex. For an octahedral complex, these orbitals split into a lower-energy triplet set, denoted $t_{2g}$, and a higher-energy doublet set, denoted $e_g$. The energy separation between these sets is defined as the octahedral splitting parameter, $\\Delta_o$.\n\nThe energy of the d-orbitals is measured relative to their average energy in a hypothetical spherical field, known as the barycenter. Each electron occupying a $t_{2g}$ orbital stabilizes the complex by an energy of $-0.4\\Delta_o$, while each electron occupying an $e_g$ orbital destabilizes it by an energy of $+0.6\\Delta_o$. The total energy change due to this effect is called the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE).\n\nConsider the hexaamminenickel(II) ion, $[Ni(NH_3)_6]^{2+}$.

Neutral Ni has configuration $[Ar]\\,3d^{8}4s^{2}$; removing two electrons gives $Ni^{2+}: [Ar]\\,3d^{8}$, so it is a $d^{8}$ ion.\n\nIn an octahedral field, the five $d$ orbitals split into lower-energy $t_{2g}$ (three orbitals) and higher-energy $e_{g}$ (two orbitals). For a $d^{8}$ ion, the energetically favored distribution places six electrons in $t_{2g}$ and two in $e_{g}$, i.e., $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{2}$. This occupancy arises regardless of weak- or strong-field considerations because after singly occupying all five $d$ orbitals, the remaining three electrons must pair, and pairing occurs preferentially in the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set, yielding $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{2}$.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\text{CFSE} = 6(-0.4\\,\\Delta_{o}) + 2(+0.6\\,\\Delta_{o}) = (-2.4 + 1.2)\\,\\Delta_{o} = -1.2\\,\\Delta_{o}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1.2\\Delta_{o}}$$"}, {"introduction": "The true power of a scientific theory lies in its ability to interpret experimental data and make predictions.
