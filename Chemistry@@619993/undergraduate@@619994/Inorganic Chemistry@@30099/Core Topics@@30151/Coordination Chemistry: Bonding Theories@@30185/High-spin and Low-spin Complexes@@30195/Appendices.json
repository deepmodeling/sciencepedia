For a $d^7$ configuration, electron placement depends on the relative magnitude of the crystal field splitting energy $\\Delta_o$ and the pairing energy $P$.\n\nFor Complex A (weak-field, high-spin), $\\Delta_o < P$, so electrons maximize spin multiplicity by occupying all available orbitals singly before pairing, even if that requires occupying the higher-energy $e_g$ set. The first five electrons singly occupy the three $t_{2g}$ and two $e_g$ orbitals, giving an intermediate configuration of $t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$. The sixth and seventh electrons must pair, and they do so in the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set, yielding the final configuration $t_{2g}^5 e_g^2$. Counting unpaired electrons: in the $t_{2g}^5$ set (three orbitals with five electrons), there is one unpaired electron, and in the $e_g^2$ set (two orbitals each singly occupied), there are two unpaired electrons. Thus, the total number of unpaired electrons is $1+2=3$.\n\nFor Complex B (strong-field, low-spin), $\\Delta_o > P$, so electrons pair in the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set before occupying the higher-energy $e_g$ set. For a $d^7$ configuration, this results in $t_{2g}^6 e_g^1$. Counting unpaired electrons: the $t_{2g}^6$ set has zero unpaired electrons (all paired), and the $e_g^1$ set has one unpaired electron.
