In a prototype device, the fundamental unit of storage is an iron(II) ion situated in a perfect octahedral coordination environment. The electronic state of this ion represents a bit of information. Under standard operating conditions, the ligand field is weak, forcing the complex into a high-spin state.

In an ideal octahedral field, the five $d$ orbitals split into a lower-energy triply degenerate set $t_{2g}$ and a higher-energy doubly degenerate set $e_{g}$, separated by the octahedral crystal field splitting $\\Delta_{o}$. Under weak-field conditions (high-spin), the pairing energy $P$ exceeds the crystal field splitting, i.e., $\\Delta_{o} < P$, so electrons avoid pairing within a set until necessary, following Hund’s rule and the Aufbau principle.\n\nElectrons are placed one by one as follows:\n- The first three electrons singly occupy the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals to minimize electron-electron repulsion (Hund’s rule), giving $t_{2g}^{3}$, all unpaired.\n- For the fourth electron, since $\\Delta_{o} < P$, it is energetically favorable to promote it to the higher $e_{g}$ level rather than pair in $t_{2g}$, giving $e_{g}^{1}$.\n- The fifth electron singly occupies the second $e_{g}$ orbital by Hund’s rule, giving $t_{2g}^{3} e_{g}^{2}$, still all unpaired.\n- The sixth electron must now pair in the lower $t_{2g}$ set (there is no third $e_{g}$ orbital), yielding the final high-spin configuration $t_{2g}^{4} e_{g}^{2}$.\n\nCounting unpaired electrons: in $t_{2g}^{4}$ there are two singly occupied $t_{2g}$ orbitals and one doubly occupied $t_{2g}$ orbital, giving two unpaired electrons from $t_{2g}$; in $e_{g}^{2}$ each $e_{g}$ orbital is singly occupied, giving two additional unpaired electrons.
