The concentration of monomer is $[M]$, the concentration of active chain radicals is $[R\\cdot]$, the propagation step is elementary with rate constant $k_p$ so that the rate of propagation is $R_p$, and bimolecular termination between any two radicals is elementary with rate constant $k_t$.

It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. We shall proceed.\n\nThe process of free-radical polymerization is described by a sequence of elementary steps: initiation, propagation, and termination. The problem provides the rates and rate constants for these steps. Our objective is to determine the rate of propagation, $R_p$, under the steady-state approximation (SSA) for the active radical species, $[R\\cdot]$.\n\nFirst, we must formulate the rate equation for the concentration of active chain radicals, $[R\\cdot]$. The concentration of these radicals changes due to two processes: creation via initiation and destruction via termination.\n\nThe rate of creation of radicals from the initiation process is given directly as $R_i$. This represents the net rate of formation of propagating radicals.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d[R\\cdot]}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{initiation}} = R_i\n$$\nThe termination step is a bimolecular reaction between two radicals, $R\\cdot + R\\cdot \\rightarrow \\text{Inactive Product}$, with a rate constant $k_t$. The rate of this elementary reaction, which corresponds to the rate of termination *events*, is given by mass-action kinetics as $k_t[R\\cdot]^2$. The problem specifies that each such event removes two radicals from the system. Therefore, the rate of consumption of radicals via termination, which we denote $R_t$, is twice the rate of termination events.\n$$\nR_t = \\left(\\frac{d[R\\cdot]}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{termination}} = -2 k_t [R\\cdot]^2\n$$\nThe propagation step, $R\\cdot + M \\rightarrow R\\cdot$, consumes a monomer molecule, $M$, but regenerates a radical. Thus, the propagation step does not alter the total concentration of active radicals, $[R\\cdot]$.\n\nThe net rate of change of the radical concentration is the sum of the rates of formation and consumption:\n$$\n\\frac{d[R\\cdot]}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{d[R\\cdot]}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{initiation}} + \\left(\\frac{d[R\\cdot]}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{termination}} = R_i - 2 k_t [R\\cdot]^2\n$$\nThe steady-state approximation (SSA) is now applied. This approximation is valid for highly reactive intermediates, such as radicals, whose concentration reaches a small, near-constant value very quickly after the reaction begins. The SSA posits that the net rate of change of the intermediate's concentration is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d[R\\cdot]}{dt} = 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to our rate equation gives:\n$$\nR_i - 2 k_t [R\\cdot]_{\\text{ss}}^2 = 0\n$$\nwhere $[R\\cdot]_{\\text{ss}}$ is the steady-state radical concentration. This equation expresses the core of the steady-state condition: the rate of radical creation equals the rate of radical destruction.\n$$\nR_i = 2 k_t [R\\cdot]_{\\text{ss}}^2\n$$\nFrom this, we solve for the steady-state radical concentration, $[R\\cdot]_{\\text{ss}}$.\n$$\n[R\\cdot]_{\\text{ss}}^2 = \\frac{R_i}{2 k_t}\n$$\n$$\n[R\\cdot]_{\\text{ss}} = \\left( \\frac{R_i}{2 k_t} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the rate of propagation, $R_p$. The rate of propagation is the rate at which monomer molecules are consumed to add to the polymer chain. It is given as an elementary step with rate constant $k_p$.\n$$\nR_p = k_p [R\\cdot] [M]\n$$\nTo find the propagation rate under steady-state conditions, we substitute the expression for $[R\\cdot]_{\\text{ss}}$ into the equation for $R_p$. The problem states that the monomer concentration $[M]$ may be treated as constant in the early stages of the reaction.\n$$\nR_p = k_p [M] [R\\cdot]_{\\text{ss}} = k_p [M] \\left( \\frac{R_i}{2 k_t} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the rate of propagation under the given assumptions.\n\nFinally, we address the physical interpretation for the square-root dependence of $R_p$ on $R_i$. The rate of propagation, $R_p$, is directly proportional to the radical concentration, $[R\\cdot]$. The steady-state condition dictates that the rate of radical initiation, $R_i$, must be balanced by the rate of radical termination, $R_t = 2 k_t [R\\cdot]^2$. Thus, $R_i \\propto [R\\cdot]^2$. This implies that $[R\\cdot] \\propto \\sqrt{R_i}$. Since $R_p \\propto [R\\cdot]$, it follows directly that $R_p \\propto \\sqrt{R_i}$. The physical reason for this mathematical relationship lies in the different kinetic orders of the creation and destruction processes. Radicals are generated through a process that is typically first-order (or zeroth-order if the initiator decomposition is the sole source and its concentration is constant, as packaged into $R_i$), but they are destroyed via a second-order bimolecular process. For a second-order destruction pathway to balance a first-order (or zeroth-order) creation pathway, the concentration of the species being destroyed must scale as the square root of the creation rate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k_p [M] \\left( \\frac{R_i}{2 k_t} \\right)^{1/2}}\n$$", "id": "2627237"}, {"introduction": "After establishing the kinetic framework for the overall rate, let's turn to selectivity: if a reaction can form multiple products, how can we predict the outcome?
