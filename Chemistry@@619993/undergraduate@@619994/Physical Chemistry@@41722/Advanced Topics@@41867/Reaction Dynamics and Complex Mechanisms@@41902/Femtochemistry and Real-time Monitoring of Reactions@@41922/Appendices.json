In a typical experiment, a single ultrashort laser pulse is split into two separate beams: a \"pump\" beam and a \"probe\" beam. The pump beam initiates a chemical reaction in a sample. The probe beam, which is sent along a path with a variable length, arrives at the sample after a specific time delay to monitor the state of the reaction. This time delay is precisely controlled by changing the physical distance the probe beam travels.\n\nConsider such an experiment designed to study a molecular process that is predicted to occur over a timescale of $50.0$ femtoseconds (fs).
