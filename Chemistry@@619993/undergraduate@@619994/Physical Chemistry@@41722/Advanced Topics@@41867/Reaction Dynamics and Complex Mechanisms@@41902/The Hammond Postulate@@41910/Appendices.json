The molecule can exist in two distinct conformations: a stable *cis*-isomer (C) and a less stable *trans*-isomer (T). The interconversion between these two forms can be modeled as an elementary reaction in each direction.\n\nThe conversion from the *cis*-isomer to the *trans*-isomer, which can be represented as the reaction $C \\rightarrow T$, is found to be an endergonic process with a standard Gibbs free energy change of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{C \\rightarrow T} = +18.5 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.

The structures of the transition states cannot be determined from thermodynamic data alone and would require complex computational modeling.", "solution": "The problem requires us to apply the Hammond postulate to determine the structural characteristics of the transition state for the interconversion between a *cis*-isomer (C) and a *trans*-isomer (T).\n\nStep 1: State the Hammond Postulate.\nThe Hammond postulate states that the structure of a transition state for a reaction step will more closely resemble the structure of the species (reactant or product of that step) to which it is closer in Gibbs free energy. In simpler terms, for an endergonic reaction, the transition state resembles the product, and for an exergonic reaction, the transition state resembles the reactant.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given thermodynamic data.\nWe are given that the standard Gibbs free energy change for the forward reaction $C \\rightarrow T$ is $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{C \\rightarrow T} = +18.5 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\nSince $\\Delta G^{\\circ} > 0$, the forward reaction ($C \\rightarrow T$) is endergonic. This means the product, the *trans*-isomer (T), is at a higher Gibbs free energy level than the reactant, the *cis*-isomer (C).\nThe energy ordering of the stable species is $G^{\\circ}(C)  G^{\\circ}(T)$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the reverse reaction.\nThe reverse reaction is $T \\rightarrow C$. The standard Gibbs free energy change for this reaction is the negative of the forward reaction:\n$\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{T \\rightarrow C} = - \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{C \\rightarrow T} = -18.5 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\nSince $\\Delta G^{\\circ}  0$, the reverse reaction ($T \\rightarrow C$) is exergonic.\n\nStep 4: Visualize the reaction energy profile.\nFor any elementary reaction, the transition state (TS) represents an energy maximum along the reaction coordinate between the reactant and product. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy of the transition state, $G^{\\circ}(TS)$, is higher than both $G^{\\circ}(C)$ and $G^{\\circ}(T)$.\nThe overall energy ordering is $G^{\\circ}(C)  G^{\\circ}(T)  G^{\\circ}(TS)$. This means that on a reaction coordinate diagram, the energy of the transition state is closer to the energy of the *trans*-isomer (T) than it is to the energy of the *cis*-isomer (C).\n\nStep 5: Apply the Hammond Postulate to the forward reaction ($C \\rightarrow T$).\nThis is an endergonic reaction. The reactants are C and the products are T. According to the Hammond postulate, the transition state will resemble the species it is closer to in energy. As established, $G^{\\circ}(TS)$ is closer to $G^{\\circ}(T)$ than to $G^{\\circ}(C)$. Therefore, the transition state $TS_{C \\rightarrow T}$ structurally resembles the product, T. This is often referred to as a \"late\" transition state.\n\nStep 6: Apply the Hammond Postulate to the reverse reaction ($T \\rightarrow C$).\nThis is an exergonic reaction. The reactant is T and the product is C. It is important to realize that the forward and reverse reactions proceed through the *same* transition state. This single transition state is denoted as $TS_{C \\rightarrow T}$ for the forward path and $TS_{T \\rightarrow C}$ for the reverse path, but it is the same molecular configuration and energy point.\nFor the reverse reaction, the transition state still has an energy $G^{\\circ}(TS)$ that is closer to the reactant T ($G^{\\circ}(T)$) than to the product C ($G^{\\circ}(C)$). Following the postulate, the transition state resembles the reactant, which is T. This is often referred to as an \"early\" transition state (relative to the starting point T).\n\nStep 7: Synthesize the results and select the correct option.\nIn both the forward and reverse directions, the analysis leads to the same conclusion: the structure of the single transition state for the interconversion most closely resembles the *trans*-isomer (T). This is because T is the higher-energy species of the two stable isomers, and the transition state is always closer in energy to the adjacent higher-energy species.\n\nTherefore, the structures of both $TS_{C \\rightarrow T}$ and $TS_{T \\rightarrow C}$ (which are the same) resemble the *trans*-isomer (T).\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\nA. Incorrect. This would imply the forward reaction is exergonic and the reverse reaction is also exergonic, which is a contradiction.\nB. Incorrect. This would imply the TS structure changes depending on the direction of the reaction, which is false. There is only one TS.\nC. Incorrect. The TS resembles the higher-energy species, which is T, not the lower-energy C.\nD. Correct. As derived, the single transition state structure resembles the higher-energy T isomer, whether approached from C or T.\nE. Incorrect.

This type of analysis is crucial for explaining regioselectivity in organic chemistry, such as why electrophilic additions to asymmetric alkenes favor one product over another.

The first step of this reaction is rate-determining and involves the protonation of the double bond to form a carbocation intermediate. Two distinct pathways exist for this initial step:\n\n- **Pathway 1:** Protonation at the terminal carbon (C1) of the double bond, which forms a secondary carbocation intermediate.\n- **Pathway 2:** Protonation at the internal carbon (C2) of the double bond, which forms a primary carbocation intermediate.\n\nThe relative standard enthalpies ($\\Delta H^\\circ$) for the species involved have been determined, with the reactants (propene + HX) serving as the zero-energy reference point:\n- Reactants (Propene + HX): $\\Delta H^\\circ = 0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- Secondary Carbocation Intermediate (from Pathway 1) + $\\text{X}^-$: $\\Delta H^\\circ = +65 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- Primary Carbocation Intermediate (from Pathway 2) + $\\text{X}^-$: $\\Delta H^\\circ = +130 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n\nGiven that the formation of both intermediates from the reactants is an endothermic process, and by applying the Hammond postulate, which one of the following statements most accurately describes the properties of the transition states ($TS_1$ for Pathway 1 and $TS_2$ for Pathway 2) for this rate-determining step?\n\nA. $TS_1$ is lower in energy than $TS_2$, and both transition states are structurally similar to the carbocation intermediates.\n\nB. $TS_2$ is lower in energy than $TS_1$, and both transition states are structurally similar to the reactants.\n\nC. $TS_1$ and $TS_2$ have approximately equal energies, and both are structurally similar to the carbocation intermediates.\n\nD. $TS_1$ is lower in energy than $TS_2$, and both transition states are structurally similar to the reactants.\n\nE. The relative stabilities of the carbocation intermediates have no influence on the energies of their respective transition states.", "solution": "The problem asks us to use the Hammond postulate to analyze the transition states of the two possible initial steps in the electrophilic addition of HX to propene.\n\n**Step 1: State the Hammond Postulate**\nThe Hammond postulate states that for a single reaction step, the structure and energy of the transition state will more closely resemble the species (reactants or products) to which it is closer in energy on a reaction coordinate diagram.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Nature of the Transition States (Reactant-like vs. Product-like)**\nThe problem provides the relative enthalpies of the reactants ($0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$) and the products of the first step (the carbocation intermediates, at $+65 \\text{ kJ/mol}$ and $+130 \\text{ kJ/mol}$). Since the enthalpy change for both pathways is positive, the first step of the reaction is endothermic.\n\nFor an endothermic reaction step, the products are higher in energy than the reactants. On a reaction coordinate diagram, the peak of the energy barrier (the transition state) will be closer in energy to the high-energy products than to the low-energy reactants. According to the Hammond postulate, this means the transition state will be \"product-like,\" meaning its structure resembles the structure of the carbocation intermediate. This conclusion applies to both Pathway 1 and Pathway 2. This allows us to eliminate options B and D, which claim the transition states are reactant-like.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Stabilities of the Intermediates**\nWe are given the following energies for the products of the first step:\n- Secondary Carbocation Intermediate (Pathway 1): $\\Delta H^\\circ = +65 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- Primary Carbocation Intermediate (Pathway 2): $\\Delta H^\\circ = +130 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n\nA lower enthalpy corresponds to a more stable species. Therefore, the secondary carbocation formed in Pathway 1 is significantly more stable than the primary carbocation formed in Pathway 2.\n\n**Step 4: Relate Intermediate Stability to Transition State Energy**\nFrom Step 2, we established that the transition states are product-like. The Hammond postulate implies that factors that stabilize the product will also stabilize the transition state leading to it. Since the transition states ($TS_1$ and $TS_2$) resemble their respective carbocation products, the energy ordering of the transition states will follow the energy ordering of the products.\n\nThe product of Pathway 1 (secondary carbocation) is more stable (lower in energy) than the product of Pathway 2 (primary carbocation). Consequently, the transition state for Pathway 1 ($TS_1$) must be more stable (lower in energy) than the transition state for Pathway 2 ($TS_2$). A lower transition state energy corresponds to a lower activation energy, making that pathway faster.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Options**\nLet's re-examine the remaining options based on our analysis:\n\n- **A. $TS_1$ is lower in energy than $TS_2$, and both transition states are structurally similar to the carbocation intermediates.** This statement is fully consistent with our findings. The transition states are product-like (similar to carbocations) due to the endothermic nature of the step, and $TS_1$ is lower in energy than $TS_2$ because the secondary carbocation is more stable than the primary one.\n\n- **C. $TS_1$ and $TS_2$ have approximately equal energies, and both are structurally similar to the carbocation intermediates.** This is incorrect. Since the intermediates have significantly different energies ($65 \\text{ kJ/mol}$ vs. $130 \\text{ kJ/mol}$), the Hammond postulate predicts that their corresponding product-like transition states will also have significantly different energies.\n\n- **E. The relative stabilities of the carbocation intermediates have no influence on the energies of their respective transition states.** This statement is a direct contradiction of the Hammond postulate's application to this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly applies the Hammond postulate to the provided data is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2013148"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice is an advanced challenge that extends the principles of the Hammond Postulate to a two-dimensional energy surface, the More O'Ferrall-Jencks plot.
