The very concept of a potential energy surface relies on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which separates the motion of electrons and nuclei. This final practice uses a thought experiment on isotopic substitution to probe this core principle, solidifying your understanding of why the PES is a property of the electronic structure, independent of nuclear mass.", "problem": "In the study of chemical reaction dynamics, it is often necessary to consider isotopic substitution to probe reaction mechanisms.

The potential energy of a molecular system is determined by the electronic structure, which depends on the coulombic interactions between the electrons and nuclei. Since H and D have the same nuclear charge, the electronic structure and thus the potential energy surface are effectively identical.\n\nB. The zero-point energies of the reactant and product molecules are mass-dependent. However, the change in zero-point energy from reactants to products is the same for both reactions, resulting in an identical potential energy surface.\n\nC. The total mass of the reacting system is conserved in both reactions. Because the mass of the attacking atom (H or D) is much smaller than the mass of the $Cl_2$ molecule, the difference in their masses has a negligible effect on the overall energetics.\n\nD. Both reactions proceed through the same transition state geometry. As the potential energy surface is defined by the energy of the reactants, products, and the transition state, and these are the same, the surfaces must be identical.\n\nE.
