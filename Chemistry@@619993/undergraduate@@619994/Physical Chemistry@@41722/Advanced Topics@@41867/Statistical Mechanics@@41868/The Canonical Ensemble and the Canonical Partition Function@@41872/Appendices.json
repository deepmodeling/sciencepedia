The partition function for a single rotor is the sum over all its available states, weighted by the Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-E_i / (k_B T))$, where $E_i$ is the energy of state $i$ and $g_i$ is its degeneracy.\n$$q(T) = \\sum_{i} g_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe problem provides two energy levels for each rotor:\n1.
