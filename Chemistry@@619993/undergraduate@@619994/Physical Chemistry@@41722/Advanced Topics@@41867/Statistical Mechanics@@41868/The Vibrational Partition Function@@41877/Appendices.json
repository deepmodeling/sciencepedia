Measuring energies from the ground state ($v=0$), the energy levels are $\\epsilon_v = vh\\nu$. The partition function is then:\n$$\nq_{vib} = \\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_v) = \\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta vh\\nu) = \\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} [\\exp(-\\beta h\\nu)]^{v}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$, with $k_B$ being the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the absolute temperature.\n\nThis is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n = \\frac{1}{1-x}$ with $x = \\exp(-\\beta h\\nu)$. Since vibrational energy gaps are typically large compared to $k_B T$, we have $h\\nu > 0$, and thus $0 < \\exp(-\\beta h\\nu) < 1$, so the series converges.\n\nThe partition function for a single vibrational mode is therefore:\n$$\nq_{vib} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta h\\nu)}\n$$\nThe problem provides the frequencies in terms of wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, which is related to frequency by $\\nu = c\\tilde{\\nu}$, where $c$ is the speed of light.

Let's analyze the function $q_{vib}(\\tilde{\\nu})$. The term in the exponent is $-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}$. Since $h, c, k_B,$ and $T$ are all positive constants, this exponent is a negative value whose magnitude is directly proportional to $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\n- As the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ increases, the exponent $-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}$ becomes more negative.\n- As the exponent becomes more negative, the term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}\\right)$ approaches 0.\n- As this exponential term approaches 0, the denominator $1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}\\right)$ approaches 1.\n- Therefore, as $\\tilde{\\nu}$ increases, $q_{vib}$ approaches 1.\n\nConversely:\n- As the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ decreases, the exponent $-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}$ becomes less negative (i.e., it approaches 0 from the left).\n- As the exponent approaches 0, the term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}\\right)$ approaches 1.\n- As this exponential term approaches 1, the denominator $1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}\\right)$ approaches 0 (from the positive side).\n- Therefore, as $\\tilde{\\nu}$ decreases, $q_{vib}$ increases.\n\nThis shows that the vibrational partition function $q_{vib}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the vibrational wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$.
