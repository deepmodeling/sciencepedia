We analyze this statement term by term.\n1.  **Translational**: $q_{trans} = (\\frac{2\\pi m k_B T}{h^2})^{3/2}V$. Since the masses are identical ($m_A=m_B$) and the temperature $T$ and volume $V$ (implied by standard concentration) are the same, $q_{trans,A} = q_{trans,B}$.\n2.  **Rotational**: The problem states that rotational properties are indistinguishable, implying $q_{rot,A} = q_{rot,B}$.\n3.  **Electronic**: The electronic partition function is $q_{elec} = g_{el} e^{-E_{BO}/(k_B T)}$, where $E_{BO}$ is the Born-Oppenheimer energy (minimum electronic energy). The problem states that $E_{BO,A} = E_{BO,B}$. Assuming the ground electronic state is non-degenerate for both isomers ($g_{el,A}=g_{el,B}=1$), we have $q_{elec,A} = q_{elec,B}$.\n4.  **Vibrational**: The total vibrational partition function is the product of partition functions for each normal mode, $q_{vib} = \\prod_i q_{vib,i}$. The problem states that all modes are unchanged except for one. Therefore, the product of partition functions for the unchanged modes will be identical for $A$ and $B$ and will cancel in the ratio for $K$.\n\nThus, the equilibrium constant simplifies to the ratio of the partition functions for the single vibrational mode that differs between species $A$ and $B$.\n$$K = \\frac{q_{vib, B, \\text{diff}}}{q_{vib, A, \\text{diff}}}$$\nThe energy levels for this harmonic oscillator are given as $E_n = h\\nu(n+\\frac{1}{2})$. The partition function for this mode is the sum over all its quantum states:\n$$q_{vib} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-E_n / (k_B T)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-h\\nu(n+1/2) / (k_B T)}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$q_{vib} = e^{-h\\nu/(2k_B T)} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (e^{-h\\nu/(k_B T)})^n$$\nThe summation is a geometric series with sum $\\frac{1}{1 - e^{-h\\nu/(k_B T)}}$. So, the partition function for a single vibrational mode is:\n$$q_{vib} = \\frac{e^{-h\\nu/(2k_B T)}}{1 - e^{-h\\nu/(k_B T)}}$$\nThis expression correctly references the molecular energy to the bottom of the Born-Oppenheimer potential well. Substituting this into the expression for $K$:\n$$K = \\frac{ \\frac{e^{-h\\nu_B/(2k_B T)}}{1 - e^{-h\\nu_B/(k_B T)}} }{ \\frac{e^{-h\\nu_A/(2k_B T)}}{1 - e^{-h\\nu_A/(k_B T)}} } = \\left(\\frac{1 - e^{-h\\nu_A/(k_B T)}}{1 - e^{-h\\nu_B/(k_B T)}}\\right) e^{-(h\\nu_B - h\\nu_A)/(2k_B T)}$$\nLet us define the dimensionless quantity $x = \\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}$. The expression for $K$ becomes:\n$$K = \\left(\\frac{1 - e^{-x_A}}{1 - e^{-x_B}}\\right) e^{-(x_B - x_A)/2}$$\nWe are given $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\tilde{\\nu}_A = 2000\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and $\\tilde{\\nu}_B = 1000\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.
