[@problem_id:2006802]", "problem": "A gas-phase catalytic reaction $A(g) + B(g) \\rightarrow P(g)$ is studied over a solid catalyst surface. An experiment is designed to probe the reaction mechanism. The initial rate of the reaction is measured as a function of the partial pressure of species A, $P_A$, while the partial pressure of species B, $P_B$, and the temperature are held constant. The experimental data reveal that the reaction rate initially increases as $P_A$ increases from zero, reaches a maximum value at a certain pressure, and then begins to decrease as $P_A$ is increased to very high values.\n\nTwo common a priori models for such bimolecular surface reactions are the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism, in which both reactants must adsorb onto the surface before reacting, and the Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism, in which one reactant adsorbs and then reacts with a molecule of the second reactant directly from the gas phase.\n\nAssuming the surface reaction is the rate-determining step and that the adsorption of reactants can be described by the Langmuir model, which of the following statements provides the correct mechanistic explanation for the observed rate behavior?\n\nA.

The mechanism is Langmuir-Hinshelwood. The rate decreases at high $P_A$ because the reaction becomes limited by the rate of diffusion of B to the surface, which is slowed by the high concentration of A.\n\nE. The mechanism is Eley-Rideal. The rate is proportional to the product of $P_B$ and the surface coverage of A ($\\theta_A$). At high $P_A$, $\\theta_A$ approaches its maximum value, causing the rate to decrease.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must derive the theoretical rate laws for both the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) and Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanisms and analyze their behavior as a function of the partial pressure of one reactant, $P_A$, while the other, $P_B$, is held constant. The observed experimental behavior is that the rate passes through a maximum and then decreases at high $P_A$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism. In this mechanism, one species adsorbs, and the other reacts from the gas phase. Let's assume species A adsorbs and species B reacts from the gas phase. The elementary steps are:\n1. Adsorption of A: $A(g) + S \\rightleftharpoons A(ads)$\n2. Surface reaction: $A(ads) + B(g) \\rightarrow P(g) + S$\n\nWe assume the surface reaction (step 2) is the rate-determining step. The rate of reaction is then proportional to the surface concentration of adsorbed A, $[A(ads)]$, and the partial pressure of gaseous B, $P_B$. In terms of surface coverage $\\theta_A$, the rate is given by:\n$Rate = k_r [A(ads)] [B(g)] \\propto k_r' \\theta_A P_B$\n\nThe surface coverage $\\theta_A$ is described by the Langmuir isotherm for a single species:\n$$\n\\theta_A = \\frac{K_A P_A}{1 + K_A P_A}\n$$\nwhere $K_A$ is the adsorption equilibrium constant for A.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\theta_A$ into the rate equation gives the rate law for the ER mechanism:\n$$\nRate_{ER} = k \\frac{K_A P_A P_B}{1 + K_A P_A}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is an effective rate constant.\n\nNow, we analyze the behavior of $Rate_{ER}$ as a function of $P_A$ (keeping $P_B$ constant):\n- At low $P_A$ ($K_A P_A \\ll 1$): The denominator is approximately 1. The rate expression simplifies to $Rate_{ER} \\approx k K_A P_A P_B$. The rate is first-order with respect to A and increases linearly with $P_A$.\n- At high $P_A$ ($K_A P_A \\gg 1$): The denominator is approximately $K_A P_A$. The rate expression becomes $Rate_{ER} \\approx k \\frac{K_A P_A P_B}{K_A P_A} = k P_B$. The rate becomes independent of $P_A$ (zeroth-order with respect to A) and approaches a constant plateau value.\n\nThe rate for an ER mechanism increases with $P_A$ and then saturates, but it never decreases. Therefore, the ER mechanism cannot explain the experimental observation. This invalidates options A, C, and E. Option A is additionally incorrect because B is gaseous and does not require a vacant site. Option E incorrectly claims saturation leads to a rate decrease; it leads to a rate plateau.\n\nNext, let's analyze the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism. In this mechanism, both species A and B must adsorb on the surface before they can react. The elementary steps are:\n1. Adsorption of A: $A(g) + S \\rightleftharpoons A(ads)$\n2. Adsorption of B: $B(g) + S \\rightleftharpoons B(ads)$\n3. Surface reaction: $A(ads) + B(ads) \\rightarrow P(g) + 2S$\n\nAssuming the surface reaction (step 3) is the rate-determining step, the rate is proportional to the product of the surface coverages of A and B:\n$Rate = k_r \\theta_A \\theta_B$\n\nWhen two species compete for the same adsorption sites, their coverages are given by the competitive Langmuir isotherm:\n$$\n\\theta_A = \\frac{K_A P_A}{1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = \\frac{K_B P_B}{1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B}\n$$\nwhere $K_A$ and $K_B$ are the respective adsorption equilibrium constants.\n\nSubstituting these into the rate equation gives the rate law for the LH mechanism:\n$$\nRate_{LH} = k_r \\frac{K_A P_A K_B P_B}{(1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B)^2}\n$$\n\nNow, we analyze the behavior of $Rate_{LH}$ as a function of $P_A$ (keeping $P_B$ constant):\n- At low $P_A$ ($K_A P_A \\ll 1 + K_B P_B$): The denominator is approximately constant, $(1 + K_B P_B)^2$. The rate expression is $Rate_{LH} \\propto \\frac{P_A}{(constant)^2}$. The rate increases linearly with $P_A$.\n- At high $P_A$ ($K_A P_A \\gg 1 + K_B P_B$): The denominator is dominated by the $K_A P_A$ term and becomes approximately $(K_A P_A)^2$. The rate expression becomes:\n$Rate_{LH} \\approx k_r \\frac{K_A P_A K_B P_B}{(K_A P_A)^2} = \\frac{k_r K_B P_B}{K_A P_A}$\nIn this limit, the rate is inversely proportional to $P_A$ ($Rate_{LH} \\propto 1/P_A$). Thus, the rate *decreases* as $P_A$ becomes very large.\n\nSince the rate increases at low $P_A$ and decreases at high $P_A$, it must pass through a maximum at some intermediate pressure. This behavior is consistent with the experimental observation. The physical interpretation is that at very high $P_A$, reactant A floods the catalyst surface ($\\theta_A \\to 1$), competitively displacing reactant B ($\\theta_B \\to 0$). Since the reaction requires both adsorbed A and adsorbed B, the scarcity of adsorbed B causes the overall reaction rate to fall.\n\nThis matches the reasoning in option B. Option D suggests an alternative cause (diffusion limitation), which is a separate physical phenomenon not described by the intrinsic kinetic model of the LH mechanism itself. The LH model predicts the rate decrease due to competitive adsorption.\n\nTherefore, the observation is characteristic of a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism where the reactants compete for the same surface sites.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2006802"}]}
