The simulation is configured to run in the canonical ensemble (NVT), where the number of particles (N), the volume of the simulation box (V), and the average temperature of the system (T) are intended to be held constant. To maintain a constant temperature, a thermostat algorithm is employed, which acts by rescaling particle velocities to ensure the total kinetic energy of the system remains fixed at a target value.\n\nUpon analyzing the output data, the student plots the total kinetic energy ($K$) and the total potential energy ($U$) of the system as a function of simulation time. They confirm that the kinetic energy remains perfectly constant throughout the run, exactly as dictated by the thermostat. However, they are surprised to observe that the potential energy is steadily and continuously increasing.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements provides the most plausible physical interpretation of what is occurring within the simulation box?\n\nA. The argon atoms are spontaneously organizing into a lower-energy crystal structure, a process known as freezing.\n\nB.

The system is undergoing an endothermic phase transition, such as melting or boiling, where externally supplied energy is used to change the phase at a constant temperature.\n\nD. The system is violating the law of conservation of energy because the total energy is not constant, which points to a fundamental error in the MD simulation software.\n\nE. The total energy of the system is decreasing as the atoms settle into a more stable configuration, leading to the observed increase in potential energy.", "solution": "The thermostat is described as rescaling particle velocities so that the total kinetic energy remains fixed at a target value. In classical MD, this corresponds to an isokinetic constraint, so the instantaneous kinetic energy satisfies\n$$\nK(t)=K_{0}=\\frac{3}{2}Nk_{B}T_{0}.\n$$\nBy inspection of the data, $K(t)$ is perfectly constant while the potential energy $U(t)$ increases steadily, i.e., $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}t}>0$.\n\nDefine the total internal energy\n$$\nE(t)=K(t)+U(t).\n$$\nBecause the thermostat enforces $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}K}{\\mathrm{d}t}=0$, it follows that\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}t}>0.\n$$\nIn an NVT simulation, the system exchanges heat with a thermal reservoir.

Since $T$ (and therefore $K$) is held fixed, the only place for this absorbed heat to go is into the configurational degrees of freedom, i.e., an increase of $U$.\n\nA steady, monotonic increase of $U$ at fixed $T$ is the hallmark of an endothermic transformation proceeding at constant temperature, where latent heat is absorbed while the phase fraction changes. For argon with a standard pair potential (e.g., Lennard-Jones) at fixed volume, the solid typically has a lower potential energy than the liquid at the same $T$ and density, so melting is endothermic: as melting progresses, $U$ increases while $K$ remains fixed by the thermostat.\n\nThis reasoning rules out the alternatives:\n- A is inconsistent because freezing would decrease $U$ toward a lower-energy crystalline state.\n- B is inconsistent because equilibrium fluctuations are stationary about a mean, not steadily increasing over time.\n- D is incorrect because in an NVT simulation the thermostat exchanges energy with the system, so nonconservation of $E$ for the system alone is expected and not a fundamental violation.\n- E is self-contradictory: if total $E$ were decreasing and $K$ were constant, then $U$ would have to decrease, not increase.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible physical interpretation is that the system is undergoing an endothermic phase transition (e.g., melting) at constant temperature, with the thermostat supplying the latent heat, which appears as a steady increase in potential energy while $K$ remains fixed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1993212"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static equilibrium properties, MD simulations are a powerful tool for investigating how liquids move and flow, which is governed by transport coefficients.
