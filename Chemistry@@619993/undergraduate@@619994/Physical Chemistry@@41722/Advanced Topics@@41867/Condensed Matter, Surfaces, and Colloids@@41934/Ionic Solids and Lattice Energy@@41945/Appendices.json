Therefore, divalent pairs (MgO, BaS) have larger $|U|$ than monovalent pairs (LiF, RbI), all else equal.\n\nStep 2: Compare ionic radii to order $r_{0}$. The distance $r_{0}$ is approximately the sum of the ionic radii. Along a group, ionic radius increases down the group:\n- $r(\\mathrm{Rb}^{+})>r(\\mathrm{Li}^{+})$ and $r(\\mathrm{I}^{-})>r(\\mathrm{F}^{-})$, so $r_{0}(\\mathrm{RbI})>r_{0}(\\mathrm{LiF})$, implying $|\\!U\\!|(\\mathrm{RbI})<|\\!U\\!|(\\mathrm{LiF})$ within the monovalent set.\n- $r(\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+})>r(\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+})$ and $r(\\mathrm{S}^{2-})>r(\\mathrm{O}^{2-})$, so $r_{0}(\\mathrm{BaS})>r_{0}(\\mathrm{MgO})$, implying $|\\!U\\!|(\\mathrm{BaS})<|\\!U\\!|(\\mathrm{MgO})$ within the divalent set.\n\nStep 3: Compare across charge classes.
