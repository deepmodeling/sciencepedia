This exercise challenges you to apply this equation to two distinct but related systems: a liquid droplet and a soap bubble. By comparing their internal gauge pressures, you will solidify your understanding of how the number of surfaces—one for a droplet, two for a bubble—critically affects the pressure an object can sustain for a given radius and surface tension. [@problem_id:2007054]", "problem": "In the study of atmospheric aerosols and colloidal systems, understanding the pressure difference across curved liquid surfaces is fundamental. Consider two microscopic spherical objects of identical radius $R$, both suspended in the same ambient air with a constant external pressure $P_{ext}$.\n\nThe first object is a pure water droplet, which has a surface tension of $\\gamma_w$.\nThe second object is a soap bubble formed from a soap solution with a surface tension of $\\gamma_s$.\n\nYour task is to determine the analytical expression for the ratio of the gauge pressure inside the soap bubble to the gauge pressure inside the water droplet. The gauge pressure is defined as the difference between the absolute pressure inside the object and the external ambient pressure.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the gauge pressure in a soap bubble to that in a water droplet of the same radius. The gauge pressure, $\\Delta P$, is the excess pressure inside a curved surface and is given by the Young-Laplace equation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the water droplet. A droplet is a solid sphere of liquid, so it has only one surface interface with the surrounding air. The Young-Laplace equation for the pressure difference across a single spherical interface is:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the surface tension and $R$ is the radius of the sphere.\n\nFor the water droplet, the surface tension is $\\gamma_w$. Therefore, the gauge pressure inside the water droplet, $\\Delta P_{droplet}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta P_{droplet} = P_{internal, droplet} - P_{ext} = \\frac{2\\gamma_w}{R} $$\n\nNext, let's analyze the soap bubble. A soap bubble consists of a thin shell of liquid (the soap solution) with air inside and air outside. This means it has two surface interfaces: an inner surface and an outer surface. We can assume the bubble's shell is infinitesimally thin, so both the inner and outer surfaces have approximately the same radius, $R$.\n\nThe pressure difference arises from the surface tension acting on both of these surfaces. The pressure jump from the outside air to inside the liquid shell is $2\\gamma_s/R$. The pressure jump from inside the liquid shell to the air trapped inside the bubble is also $2\\gamma_s/R$. Therefore, the total pressure difference between the inside of the bubble and the outside ambient air is the sum of these two jumps.\n\nAlternatively, the Young-Laplace equation for a thin-walled bubble (which has two surfaces) is:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{4\\gamma}{R} $$\nThis factor of 4 arises because there are two surfaces contributing to the pressure difference.\n\nFor the soap bubble, the surface tension of the solution is $\\gamma_s$. Therefore, the gauge pressure inside the soap bubble, $\\Delta P_{bubble}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta P_{bubble} = P_{internal, bubble} - P_{ext} = \\frac{4\\gamma_s}{R} $$\n\nFinally, we need to find the ratio of the gauge pressure inside the soap bubble to the gauge pressure inside the water droplet.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{bubble}}{\\Delta P_{droplet}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\gamma_s}{R}}{\\frac{2\\gamma_w}{R}} $$\nWe can cancel the radius $R$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{4\\gamma_s}{2\\gamma_w} $$\nSimplifying the numerical factors gives the final expression:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{2\\gamma_s}{\\gamma_w} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\gamma_{s}}{\\gamma_{w}}}$$", "id": "2007054"}, {"introduction": "Capillarity, the rise or fall of liquids in narrow tubes, is a powerful manifestation of the interplay between cohesive forces (surface tension) and adhesive forces (wetting).
