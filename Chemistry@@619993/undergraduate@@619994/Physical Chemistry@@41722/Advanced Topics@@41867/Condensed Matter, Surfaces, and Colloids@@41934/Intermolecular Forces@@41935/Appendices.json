This exercise provides a quantitative look at the charge-induced dipole interaction, a key component of many intermolecular potential energy models. By calculating this energy directly, you will gain a concrete understanding of how an atom's polarizability, $\\alpha$, and an external electric field, $E$, give rise to attractive forces [@problem_id:1374895].", "id": "1374895", "problem": "A point charge with a charge of $q = +2e$ is located at a distance $R$ from the center of a neutral, spherically symmetric atom.

This is known as the charge-induced dipole interaction, a type of induction energy.\n\nFirst, we determine the electric field, $\\vec{E}$, created by the point charge $q$ at the location of the atom, a distance $R$ away.

The electronic structure of the participating molecules plays a crucial role in modulating their efficacy. This practice moves beyond the simple identification of hydrogen bonds to a deeper analysis of how effects like resonance can dramatically enhance their strength, leading to significant differences in physical properties like boiling point [@problem_id:2177444].", "id": "2177444", "problem": "Consider the two organic molecules, acetamide ($CH_3CONH_2$) and ethylamine ($CH_3CH_2NH_2$).

Based on a detailed analysis of their molecular structures and the nature of their respective hydrogen-bonding capabilities, predict which molecule has the higher boiling point and select the option that provides the most accurate reasoning for this difference.\n\nA. Acetamide has a higher boiling point. Resonance delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair onto the carbonyl oxygen increases the polarity of the N-H bonds and makes the carbonyl oxygen a stronger hydrogen bond acceptor, leading to overall stronger hydrogen bonds.\nB. Acetamide has a higher boiling point. It has a greater number of hydrogen bond acceptor sites (both the nitrogen lone pair and the carbonyl oxygen) compared to ethylamine (only the nitrogen lone pair).\nC. Ethylamine has a higher boiling point. The lone pair on the nitrogen of ethylamine is more localized and thus a more available hydrogen bond acceptor than the resonance-delocalized lone pair in acetamide.\nD. Ethylamine has a higher boiling point. The ethyl group is larger than the methyl group attached to the functional group, leading to stronger London dispersion forces that outweigh the differences in hydrogen bonding.\nE. Both molecules have nearly identical boiling points. They each possess two N-H bonds, giving them the same number of hydrogen bond donor sites, which is the primary factor for hydrogen bond strength.\n\n", "solution": "Hydrogen bonding is the dominant intermolecular force for both acetamide (CH3CONH2) and ethylamine (CH3CH2NH2). The qualitative strength of a hydrogen bond increases with both the acidity (polarity) of the donor N-H bond and the basicity/electronegativity of the acceptor site; a simple electrostatic component of the interaction scales with the product of the partial charges, so that larger $q_{H}$ on the donor hydrogen and larger $q_{A}$ on the acceptor increase the interaction energy. Additionally, overall molecular dipole and the availability of acceptor sites influence the cohesive energy and thus boiling point.\n\nFor acetamide, the amide group exhibits resonance between a structure with a C=O and a nitrogen lone pair, and a zwitterionic contributor with C=N and charges localized as $O^{-}$ and $N^{+}$. This resonance delocalizes the nitrogen lone pair onto the carbonyl, which has two key consequences for hydrogen bonding: (i) the carbonyl oxygen becomes more electron-rich and is a strong hydrogen bond acceptor; (ii) electron withdrawal from nitrogen increases the polarity of the N-H bonds, making the hydrogens better donors. Thus, acetamide effectively presents one strong acceptor (the carbonyl oxygen) and two relatively strong donors (the N-H bonds), and it also possesses a large molecular dipole arising from the polar amide functionality.\n\nFor ethylamine, the nitrogen lone pair is localized and serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor, and the molecule has two N-H donors. However, nitrogen is a weaker hydrogen bond acceptor than a carbonyl oxygen, and the N-H bonds in an amine are less polarized (less acidic) than in an amide due to the absence of the adjacent carbonyl. Therefore, for ethylamine, both the donor strength and the acceptor strength are weaker compared to those in acetamide. Although ethylamine has a slightly larger alkyl group than acetamide’s methyl substituent, any increase in London dispersion forces from the ethyl group does not compensate for the significantly stronger hydrogen bonding and larger dipole present in acetamide.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A correctly identifies that resonance delocalization enhances the carbonyl oxygen’s acceptor strength and increases N-H bond polarity, leading to stronger hydrogen bonds overall, which raises the boiling point of acetamide relative to ethylamine.\n- Option B is incorrect because the amide nitrogen lone pair is delocalized and is a poor hydrogen bond acceptor; acetamide does not effectively have both nitrogen and oxygen as strong acceptors.\n- Option C is incorrect because, despite the ethylamine nitrogen lone pair being more available as an acceptor than the amide nitrogen lone pair, the carbonyl oxygen in acetamide is a much stronger acceptor and the amide N-H donors are stronger, resulting in stronger overall hydrogen bonding in acetamide.\n- Option D is incorrect because enhanced dispersion from an ethyl group does not outweigh the much stronger hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions in acetamide.\n- Option E is incorrect because having the same number of donor N-H bonds does not equalize hydrogen bond strength; the strength depends critically on donor acidity and acceptor capability, both of which favor acetamide.\n\nTherefore, acetamide has the higher boiling point, and Option A provides the most accurate reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "While stronger intermolecular forces generally lead to higher boiling and melting points, the relationship is not always straightforward, especially when comparing isomers. Molecular shape influences not only the strength of London dispersion forces but also how efficiently molecules can pack into a solid crystal lattice. By examining the contrasting trends in the boiling and melting points of n-pentane and neopentane, this classic example demonstrates that while boiling points are governed by force strength in the liquid state, melting points are also highly sensitive to molecular symmetry and packing efficiency [@problem_id:2177496].", "id": "2177496", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with identifying two unlabeled liquid samples, designated Compound P and Compound Q.

The student performs a careful measurement of their boiling points and melting points, obtaining the following data:\n\n*   **Compound P**: Boiling Point = 9.5 °C; Melting Point = -16.6 °C\n*   **Compound Q**: Boiling Point = 36.1 °C; Melting Point = -129.7 °C\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces and molecular structure, which of the following statements provides the most accurate identification of the compounds and the correct reasoning for the observed differences in both their boiling and melting points?\n\nA. Compound P is n-pentane and Compound Q is neopentane. The lower boiling point of n-pentane is due to its chain flexibility. The higher melting point of neopentane is due to its rigid, branched structure which promotes stronger intermolecular attractions in the solid state.\n\nB. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane arises because its compact, spherical shape reduces the available surface area for contact between molecules, leading to weaker London dispersion forces. Its higher melting point is a result of its high symmetry, which allows for very efficient packing into a crystal lattice, making the solid state unusually stable.\n\nC.

Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane is due to weaker London dispersion forces associated with its smaller surface area. Its higher melting point is due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions that are only present in the solid phase.\n\n", "solution": "The problem requires us to identify two isomers, n-pentane and neopentane, based on their given boiling and melting points, and to select the correct physical-chemical explanation for these properties.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecular structures.**\nBoth n-pentane and neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane) have the same molecular formula, $C_5H_{12}$. This means they have the same molar mass, and any differences in physical properties must arise from their different shapes.\n*   **n-pentane**: A straight-chain alkane, its molecule is long, linear, and flexible.\n*   **neopentane**: A branched-chain alkane, its molecule is highly compact and symmetrical, approaching a spherical shape.\n\nSince both molecules are nonpolar alkanes, the only intermolecular forces present are London dispersion forces (a type of van der Waals force).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the boiling point trend.**\nBoiling is the process of transitioning from the liquid phase to the gas phase. This requires overcoming the intermolecular forces holding the molecules together in the liquid. The strength of London dispersion forces depends on the polarizability of the electron cloud and the surface area available for intermolecular contact.\n*   n-pentane's long, chain-like shape provides a large surface area for contact with neighboring molecules. This allows for stronger, more extensive London dispersion forces.\n*   neopentane's compact, spherical shape minimizes its surface area. This reduces the area of contact between molecules, resulting in weaker London dispersion forces.\n\nTherefore, more energy is required to separate n-pentane molecules than neopentane molecules. This means n-pentane should have a higher boiling point than neopentane.\nComparing the data: Compound Q has a boiling point of 36.1 °C, while Compound P has a boiling point of 9.5 °C. Thus, **Compound Q must be n-pentane**, and **Compound P must be neopentane**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the melting point trend.**\nMelting is the process of transitioning from the ordered solid (crystal lattice) to the less-ordered liquid phase. The energy required, and thus the melting point, depends on two main factors: the strength of the intermolecular forces and the efficiency of packing in the crystal lattice.\n*   n-pentane, being a flexible and somewhat awkward shape, does not pack very efficiently into a crystal lattice. There are gaps and inefficiencies in the solid structure.\n*   neopentane, due to its high degree of symmetry (it's nearly spherical), can pack very neatly and efficiently into a crystal lattice, similar to the way marbles pack in a box. This efficient packing leads to a very stable and well-ordered solid structure.\n\nAlthough the individual intermolecular forces are weaker for neopentane, the energy required to break down its highly ordered and stable crystal lattice is significantly greater than the energy required to melt the less-efficiently packed n-pentane solid.\nTherefore, neopentane should have a higher melting point than n-pentane.\nComparing the data: Compound P has a melting point of -16.6 °C, while Compound Q has a melting point of -129.7 °C. The much higher melting point of Compound P confirms that it is neopentane, and the much lower melting point of Compound Q confirms it is n-pentane. This aligns with our conclusion from Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n*   **A**: Incorrectly identifies P as n-pentane and Q as neopentane.\n*   **B**: Correctly identifies P as neopentane and Q as n-pentane. It correctly explains the lower boiling point of neopentane as due to its smaller surface area and weaker London dispersion forces. It correctly explains the higher melting point of neopentane as due to its high symmetry allowing for efficient crystal lattice packing. This statement is entirely correct.\n*   **C**: Correctly identifies the compounds but provides an incorrect explanation for the melting point. Weaker forces alone would suggest a lower, not higher, melting point. It misses the crucial concept of packing efficiency.\n*   **D**: Incorrectly identifies the compounds and provides incorrect reasoning.\n*   **E**: Correctly identifies the compounds and the reason for the boiling point difference. However, it incorrectly attributes the melting point trend to dipole-dipole interactions, which do not exist in these nonpolar molecules.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, statement B is the only one that correctly identifies both compounds and provides the correct physical-chemical reasoning for both boiling point and melting point trends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}]}
