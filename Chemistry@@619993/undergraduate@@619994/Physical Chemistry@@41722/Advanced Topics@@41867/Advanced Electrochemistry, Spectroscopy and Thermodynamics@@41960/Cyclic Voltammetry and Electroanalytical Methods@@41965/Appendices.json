Real-world samples often contain more than one electroactive species, and understanding how to deconvolute their signals is a critical analytical skill. This problem guides you in predicting the shape of a cyclic voltammogram for a solution containing two independent redox couples, reinforcing how standard reduction potentials ($E^0$) govern the sequence of events on the potential axis.

The standard reduction potentials for these species versus a standard reference electrode are $E^0_A = +0.25$ V for the couple $A_{ox}/A_{red}$ and $E^0_B = -0.15$ V for the couple $B_{ox}/B_{red}$.\n\nThe electrochemist performs a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment on this solution. The potential of the working electrode is initially held at $+0.50$ V, where neither species reacts.

The working electrode potential program is: start at $E_{\\text{init}} = +0.50$, scan negatively to $E_{\\text{sw}} = -0.40$, then scan positively back to $+0.50$.\n\nFor each reversible couple, the Nernst equation is\n$$\nE = E^{0} + \\frac{RT}{nF}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[Ox]}{[Red]}\\right), \\quad n=1.\n$$\nAt $E > E^{0}$, the ratio $\\frac{[Ox]}{[Red]}$ is greater than one, so the oxidized form predominates and no net reduction current is observed at sufficiently positive potentials. At $E < E^{0}$, the reduced form is thermodynamically favored and, under potential sweep, a cathodic (reduction) wave leading to a diffusion-controlled cathodic peak is observed for a reversible system.

Continuing to more negative potentials, the potential then crosses $E^{0}_{B} = -0.15$, giving a second cathodic peak for the reduction of $B_{ox}$ to $B_{red}$.\n- At the switching potential $E_{\\text{sw}} = -0.40$ (which is more negative than both $E^{0}_{A}$ and $E^{0}_{B}$), both reduced forms have been generated. Upon reversing the scan toward positive potentials, oxidation peaks appear in the reverse order of the formal potentials: the couple with the more negative $E^{0}$ will oxidize at the less positive potentials first. Therefore, the first anodic peak on the return scan is the oxidation of $B_{red}$ to $B_{ox}$ near $E^{0}_{B}$, followed at a more positive potential by the oxidation of $A_{red}$ to $A_{ox}$ near $E^{0}_{A}$.\n\nThis sequence matches the description: reduction of $A_{ox}$ then $B_{ox}$ on the forward scan, and oxidation of $B_{red}$ then $A_{red}$ on the reverse scan.
