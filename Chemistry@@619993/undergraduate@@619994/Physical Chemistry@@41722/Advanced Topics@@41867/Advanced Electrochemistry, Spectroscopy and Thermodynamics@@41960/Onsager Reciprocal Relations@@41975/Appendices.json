Let $J_1$ and $J_2$ be two generalized fluxes (such as particle current density and heat current density) and let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the corresponding generalized thermodynamic forces (such as gradients of chemical potential or temperature). In the linear response regime, the relationship between these fluxes and forces is described by the following phenomenological equations:\n$$J_1 = L_{11} X_1 + L_{12} X_2$$\n$$J_2 = L_{21} X_1 + L_{22} X_2$$\nwhere the $L_{ij}$ are constant transport coefficients characterizing the material. The system is maintained in a non-equilibrium stationary state defined by the condition that the second flux vanishes, that is, $J_2 = 0$. Assuming the force $X_1$ is non-zero, determine the specific ratio of the forces, $X_2 / X_1$, that corresponds to this stationary state.

The fluid consists of a neutral, but electrically polarizable, macromolecule solute suspended in a stationary solvent. A key experimental observation is that applying a static, uniform electric field across a sample of this fluid induces a steady-state mass flux of the neutral solute. This effect is a form of coupled transport.\n\nLet us formalize the thermodynamic fluxes and forces relevant to this system. The primary fluxes of interest are the mass flux of the solute, $\\vec{J}_m$, and the electric current density, $\\vec{J}_e$. The corresponding thermodynamic driving forces are derived from gradients of thermodynamic potentials. For this isothermal system, the main forces are the \"diffusive force,\" which is proportional to the negative concentration gradient of the solute ($-\\nabla c$), and the \"electric force,\" which is the electric field $\\vec{E}$ itself (equal to the negative gradient of the electric potential, $-\\nabla \\phi$).\n\nThe observed phenomenon is the coupling where the electric force ($\\vec{E}$) drives a mass flux ($\\vec{J}_m$).
