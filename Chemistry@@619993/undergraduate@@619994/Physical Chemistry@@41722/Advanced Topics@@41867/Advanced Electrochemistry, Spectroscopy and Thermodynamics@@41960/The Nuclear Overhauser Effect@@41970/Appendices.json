A key experiment involves measuring the homonuclear Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) between two specific, non-equivalent protons, $H_A$ and $H_B$, which are close in space.\n\nInitially, the molecule is dissolved in a low-viscosity solvent (Solvent 1) at a fixed temperature, and the system is found to be in the \"extreme narrowing limit,\" characterized by very fast molecular tumbling. The rotational correlation time, $\\tau_c$, is much smaller than the inverse of the proton Larmor frequency, $\\omega_0$.\n\nSubsequently, the chemist prepares a new sample with the same molecule at the same concentration and temperature, but this time using a highly viscous solvent (Solvent 2, e.g., glycerol).

For a homonuclear case where both $I$ and $S$ are protons, the enhancement depends on the rates of various relaxation pathways, which in turn are functions of the molecular motion.\n\nThe molecular motion is characterized by the rotational correlation time, $\\tau_c$.
