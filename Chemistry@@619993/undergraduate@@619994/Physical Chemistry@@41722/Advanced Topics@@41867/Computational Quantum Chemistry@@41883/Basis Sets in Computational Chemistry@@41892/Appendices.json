This exercise introduces the concept of a \"minimal\" basis set, the simplest possible representation of a molecule's electronic structure. By manually counting the basis functions for a familiar molecule like methane, $\\text{CH}_4$, you will gain a concrete understanding of how atoms are represented in the digital world of quantum chemistry [@problem_id:1355059].", "problem": "In computational quantum chemistry, the electronic structure of a molecule is often approximated by representing molecular orbitals as a linear combination of atomic orbitals. These atomic orbitals are in turn described by a set of mathematical functions called a basis set.\n\nA foundational and historically important example is the STO-3G basis set. The \"STO\" part stands for Slater-Type Orbital, a type of function that mathematically approximates the shape of atomic orbitals. The \"3G\" part indicates that each STO is constructed from a fixed combination of 3 Gaussian-type functions. For a *minimal basis set* like STO-3G, one basis function is created for each of the core and valence atomic orbitals of an atom.\n\nBased on this principle:\n- For a Hydrogen atom (atomic number 1, configuration $1s^1$), a basis function corresponding to the 1s orbital is included.\n- For a first-row atom like Carbon (atomic number 6, configuration $1s^22s^22p^2$), basis functions corresponding to the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals are included.\n\nConsider the methane molecule, $\\text{CH}_4$.

For an $s$ subshell, this yields one $s$-type function per occupied $s$ orbital. For a $p$ subshell, the minimal basis includes the full set of three Cartesian $p$ functions ($p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z}$), regardless of the electron count in that subshell. In STO-3G, each such contracted function is represented by a fixed contraction of three Gaussian primitives, but this does not change the number of contracted basis functions; it only affects their form.\n\nFor hydrogen, each H atom has only a $1\\mathrm{s}$ orbital represented in a minimal basis. Therefore, each H contributes $1$ $s$-type basis function and $0$ $p$-type basis functions. For $\\text{CH}_4$, there are $4$ hydrogens, giving\n$$\n\\text{H contribution:}\\quad s\\text{-type} = 4\\times 1 = 4,\\quad p\\text{-type} = 0.\n$$\n\nFor carbon, the minimal basis includes $1\\mathrm{s}$ and $2\\mathrm{s}$ (two $s$-type functions) and the $2\\mathrm{p}$ shell, which contributes three $p$-type functions ($p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z}$).

The Pople-style basis sets are commonly used and have a specific notation that describes their composition.\n\nConsider the `k-LMG` notation for a split-valence basis set:\n- The hyphen separates the description of core and valence orbitals.\n- `k` is an integer representing the number of primitive Gaussian functions that are combined (contracted) to form a single basis function for each core atomic orbital.\n- `LM` describes the valence orbitals. The valence shell is \"split\" into multiple basis functions for greater flexibility. The integers `L`, `M`, ... indicate that each valence atomic orbital is represented by a set of basis functions. The first basis function is a contraction of `L` primitive Gaussians, the second is a contraction of `M` primitive Gaussians, and so on.\n- The letter `G` at the end indicates that Gaussian-type functions are used.\n\nFor example, the 6-31G basis set implies:\n1.
