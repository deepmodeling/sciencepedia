Furthermore, relativistic and QED corrections are perturbative (of order $\\alpha^{2}$ relative to a Hartree) and do not justify violating the non-relativistic variational bound.\n- D: Precision of computation does not supersede the variational theorem; no numerical method consistent with Rayleigh-Ritz can outperform the exact non-relativistic $E_{0}$ from below.\n- E: The sign of the discrepancy is decisive: a result below $E_{0}$ is not acceptable “numerical noise” but a breach of the variational bound, indicating an error.\n\nTherefore, the most valid critique is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1408490"}]}
