{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "We begin our hands-on practice by exploring one of the most direct applications of quantum mechanical principles: the response of a system to an instantaneous change. This scenario, often called the \"sudden approximation,\" is a powerful thought experiment. It illustrates the principle that at the very instant a system's Hamiltonian changes, its wavefunction remains the same, and the probability of finding it in a new energy state is simply the projection of the old state onto the new eigenstates [@problem_id:2026405]. This exercise will solidify your understanding of wavefunctions as descriptors of a system's state and how to use overlap integrals to calculate transition probabilities in this special limit.", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of an electron confined within a one-dimensional potential well, analogous to a segment of a quantum wire. The potential energy $V(x)$ is zero for $0 < x < L$ and infinite elsewhere. The normalized energy eigenfunctions for such a system of length $L$ are given by $\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{2/L} \\sin(n\\pi x/L)$ for any integer $n \\geq 1$.\n\nInitially, at time $t < 0$, the electron is in the ground state ($n=1$) of this potential well of length $L$. At time $t=0$, the system is perturbed by an external field that instantaneously changes the potential. The new potential, $V'(x)$, is zero for $0 < x < L/2$ and infinite elsewhere. This change happens so quickly that the electron's wavefunction does not have time to evolve.\n\nImmediately after this instantaneous compression at $t=0$, what is the probability of finding the electron in the ground state of the new, smaller potential well? Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "Let the initial state of the system at $t=0$ be $\\Psi(x, 0)$. The problem states that the electron is initially in the ground state ($n=1$) of a one-dimensional box of length $L$. Using the provided formula for the eigenfunctions, the initial wavefunction is:\n$$ \\Psi(x, 0) = \\psi_{1}^{(L)}(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } 0 < x < L $$\nand $\\Psi(x, 0) = 0$ elsewhere.\n\nThe perturbation is a sudden, instantaneous change in the potential well's length from $L$ to $L/2$. According to the principles of time-dependent quantum mechanics, for a sudden change in the Hamiltonian, the wavefunction of the system does not change at the instant of the perturbation. Therefore, at $t=0^+$, immediately after the compression, the state of the system is still described by $\\Psi(x, 0) = \\psi_{1}^{(L)}(x)$.\n\nWe want to find the probability of measuring the electron to be in the ground state of the new potential well. The new potential well has length $L/2$. Let's denote the eigenfunctions of this new well as $\\phi_n(x)$.
