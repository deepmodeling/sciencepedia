Fortunately, for a special class of molecules known as alternant hydrocarbons, powerful shortcuts exist. This practice introduces the 'starring method' to determine the coefficients of the non-bonding molecular orbital (NBMO) in the benzyl radical without solving the full secular determinant, a technique essential for understanding the stability and reactivity of radicals and ions. [@problem_id:1984792]", "problem": "The benzyl radical is a planar, conjugated hydrocarbon with a $\\pi$-system spanning seven carbon atoms. The molecular structure consists of a six-membered carbon ring (a phenyl group) attached to a single exocyclic carbon (a methylene group). For the purposes of this problem, the carbon atoms are numbered as follows: C1 is the exocyclic carbon, C2 is the ring carbon bonded to C1, and C3 through C7 are the remaining ring carbons numbered consecutively around the ring, such that C3 is adjacent to C2 and C4, C4 is adjacent to C3 and C5, and so on, with C7 being adjacent to C6 and C2.\n\nThe benzyl radical is an example of an alternant hydrocarbon. In Hückel Molecular Orbital (HMO) theory, such molecules possess special properties. A powerful shortcut for analyzing their electronic structure is the 'starring' method, which relies on the following rules for any Non-Bonding Molecular Orbital (NBMO), which has an energy of $E=\\alpha$:\n\n1.  The set of carbon atoms can be partitioned into a 'starred' set ($S$) and an 'unstarred' set ($U$), such that no two atoms in the same set are adjacent. The partitioning is achieved by picking an arbitrary atom, starring it, unstarring all its neighbors, starring their neighbors, and so on, until all atoms are classified.\n2.  If the number of starred atoms ($N_S$) is not equal to the number of unstarred atoms ($N_U$), there are $|N_S - N_U|$ NBMOs. The molecular orbital coefficients for any NBMO are non-zero only for the atoms belonging to the larger of the two sets.\n3.  For any NBMO, the sum of the coefficients ($c_j$) on the atoms ($j$) bonded to any given atom ($i$) is zero. This is a direct consequence of the Hückel secular equations for a zero-energy orbital (in units of the resonance integral $\\beta$).\n\nUsing this method, determine the normalized coefficients $(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6, c_7)$ of the non-bonding molecular orbital for the benzyl radical. By convention, choose the overall sign of the eigenvector such that the coefficient with the largest absolute value is negative.

Choose C1 starred. Then its neighbor C2 is unstarred. The neighbors of C2, namely C3 and C7, are starred. Their neighbors C4 and C6 are unstarred. Finally, C5, which is adjacent to C4 and C6, is starred. This yields the partition\n$$S=\\{C1,C3,C5,C7\\},\\quad U=\\{C2,C4,C6\\},$$\nso $N_{S}=4$ and $N_{U}=3$.
