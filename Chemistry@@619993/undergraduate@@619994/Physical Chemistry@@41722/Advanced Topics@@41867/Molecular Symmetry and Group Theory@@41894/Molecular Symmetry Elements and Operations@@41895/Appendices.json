The principal rotation axis is the $C_{3}$ axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the centroid of the hydrogen triangle; this is the highest-order axis in the molecule.\n\nA vertical mirror plane $\\sigma_{v}$ is defined as a plane that contains the principal axis. For $\\text{NH}_{3}$, any such plane that is a symmetry plane must map the set of atoms onto itself. Each plane that contains the $C_{3}$ axis and one N–H bond reflects the molecule such that the hydrogen on that bond is left invariant while the other two hydrogens are interchanged; this is a valid symmetry operation because all N–H bonds and H positions are equivalent. There are exactly three such choices, one for each N–H bond, yielding three distinct $\\sigma_{v}$ planes. No additional vertical planes exist that preserve the atomic positions because any plane not containing an N–H bond would not map hydrogens onto hydrogens correctly.
