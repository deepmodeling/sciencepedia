To predict its spectroscopic properties, the chemist needs to determine its molecular point group. The structure of 1,1-difluoroallene can be described as follows: a chain of three carbon atoms ($C_1=C_2=C_3$) lies on a straight line. This line defines the principal axis of the molecule. The central carbon atom, $C_2$, forms double bonds with the two terminal carbon atoms, $C_1$ and $C_3$. The first terminal carbon, $C_1$, is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The plane containing the $H-C_1-H$ atoms and the molecular axis is perpendicular to the plane containing the $F-C_3-F$ atoms and the molecular axis.\n\nBased on this geometric description, identify the correct molecular point group for 1,1-difluoroallene from the options below.\n\nA. $C_{2v}$\n\nB. $C_{2h}$\n\nC. $D_{2d}$\n\nD. $C_s$\n\nE. $C_2$\n\nF. $D_{2h}$", "solution": "Define the molecular axis as the straight line through the three carbon atoms $C_{1}=C_{2}=C_{3}$; call this the $z$-axis.

For a linear molecule, the molecular axis provides an infinite-fold rotation axis $C_{\\infty}$. The presence of a center of inversion $i$ at the midpoint between the two carbon atoms implies that inversion symmetry is present. Because the two ends are identical (H on each end and C on each side of the center), there exist $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to the molecular axis through the center: a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about any axis perpendicular to the main axis interchanges the two hydrogens and the two carbons, leaving the molecule invariant, giving an infinite set of $C_{2}$ axes. There are also infinitely many vertical mirror planes $\\sigma_{v}$ that contain the molecular axis, and a horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_{h}$ perpendicular to the axis through the center that reflects one end into the other, which is valid because the ends are identical.

This problem [@problem_id:1970087] presents a non-planar, 'twisted' conformation of ethylene, which requires careful three-dimensional consideration. Correctly identifying its point group will challenge your visualization skills and highlight the decisive role that improper rotation axes ($S_n$) often play in classifying complex molecular geometries, particularly for staggered or twisted conformations.", "problem": "The ethylene molecule, $C_2H_4$, is planar in its ground state, belonging to the $D_{2h}$ point group. During one of the relaxation pathways following photoexcitation, the molecule can temporarily adopt a non-planar, 'twisted' geometry. In this transient conformation, one methylene ($CH_2$) group is rotated by exactly 90 degrees ($ \\pi/2 $ radians) with respect to the other, around the axis defined by the C-C bond.\n\nTo visualize this structure, let the C-C bond lie along the z-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system, with the midpoint of the bond at the origin.

Place the $C_{1}$–$H_{1}$–$H_{2}$ methylene group (at $z>0$) in the $xz$-plane (so those atoms have $y=0$), and the $C_{2}$–$H_{3}$–$H_{4}$ methylene group (at $z<0$) in the $yz$-plane (so those atoms have $x=0$). All $C$–$H$ bond lengths are identical and each methylene is symmetric with respect to its own plane.\n\nTest for inversion $i$ at the origin: inversion maps $(x,y,z)\\to(-x,-y,-z)$. This sends the $xz$-plane at $z>0$ to the $xz$-plane at $z<0$, but the actual methylene at $z<0$ lies in the $yz$-plane. Therefore $i$ is absent.\n\nTest reflection in the plane perpendicular to the $z$-axis ($\\sigma_{h}$, the $xy$-plane): $(x,y,z)\\to(x,y,-z)$. This would map the upper $xz$-plane methylene to the lower $xz$-plane, but there is no such methylene there (it is in the $yz$-plane). Hence $\\sigma_{h}$ is absent.\n\nTest reflections in planes containing the $z$-axis:\n- Reflection in the $xz$-plane: $(x,y,z)\\to(x,-y,z)$. The upper methylene (in $y=0$) is unchanged; the lower methylene (in $x=0$) has $y\\to -y$, which swaps $H_{3}$ and $H_{4}$ within that identical pair. Thus the $xz$-plane is a symmetry plane.\n- Reflection in the $yz$-plane: $(x,y,z)\\to(-x,y,z)$. Analogously, the lower methylene is unchanged and the upper methylene swaps its two hydrogens. Thus the $yz$-plane is also a symmetry plane.\n\nTest $C_{2}$ about $z$: $(x,y,z)\\to(-x,-y,z)$. Each methylene plane (upper $xz$, lower $yz$) is preserved and the two equivalent hydrogens within each methylene are interchanged. Thus $C_{2}(z)$ is present.\n\nTest $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $z$:\n- About the $x$-axis: $(x,y,z)\\to(x,-y,-z)$. An atom from the upper $xz$-plane ($y=0$) goes to the lower $xz$-plane, but the actual lower methylene is in the $yz$-plane, so $C_{2}(x)$ is absent.\n- About the $y$-axis: $(x,y,z)\\to(-x,y,-z)$. Similarly, this maps the lower $yz$-plane to the upper $yz$-plane (which does not exist), so $C_{2}(y)$ is absent.\n- About axes in the $xy$-plane along the diagonals: take the unit vector along $x=y$; a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about this axis maps $(x,y,z)\\to(y,x,-z)$. This sends the upper $xz$-plane ($y=0$) to the lower $yz$-plane ($x=0$) and vice versa, correctly mapping atoms to atoms. Likewise, rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about the axis along $x=-y$ maps $(x,y,z)\\to(-y,-x,-z)$ and also interchanges the two methylenes correctly. Hence there are two $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $z$, along $x=\\pm y$.\n\nTest $S_{4}$ along $z$: by definition $S_{4}$ is a rotation by $90^{\\circ}$ about $z$ followed by reflection through the $xy$-plane. The combined mapping is $(x,y,z)\\to(-y,x,-z)$. This takes the upper $xz$-plane methylene into the lower $yz$-plane methylene and vice versa, with atoms mapped onto indistinguishable atoms. Therefore an $S_{4}$ axis along $z$ exists, and $S_{4}^{2}=C_{2}(z)$.\n\nCollecting elements: the molecule has $S_{4}$ along the $z$-axis (with $C_{2}(z)$ as $S_{4}^{2}$), two $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $z$ (along $x=\\pm y$), and two vertical mirror planes containing $z$ (the $xz$- and $yz$-planes). There is no inversion center and no horizontal mirror plane. This set of elements corresponds to the $D_{2d}$ point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular point group of the $90^{\\circ}$ twisted conformation of ethylene is $D_{2d}$, which corresponds to option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1970087"}]}
