From the $D_{\\infty h}$ character table, $z$ transforms as $\\Sigma_u^+$ and $(x,y)$ transform as $\\Pi_u$.\n\nDetermine the symmetry of the symmetric stretch:\n- Under any rotation $C_{\\infty}$ about $z$, the symmetric stretch (both O atoms moving in phase along $z$ with the central N adjusting as needed) is unchanged, hence it is a $\\Sigma$ state.\n- Under any vertical mirror plane $\\sigma_v$ containing $z$, the displacement pattern is unchanged, giving the $+$ superscript.\n- Under inversion $i$, the O at $+z$ maps to the O at $-z$, and displacement vectors invert direction; in the symmetric stretch, the mapped set of displacements coincides with the original pattern (the two O atoms exchange, and each displacement along $+z$ maps to an equivalent displacement along $-z$ on the other O), so the mode is unchanged under inversion and therefore is gerade ($g$).\nThese properties identify the symmetric stretch as transforming as $\\Sigma_g^+$. This is also consistent with the listed basis functions for $\\Sigma_g^+$ ($x^2+y^2, z^2$), since the symmetric stretch along $z$ has the symmetry of $z^2$.\n\nCompare with IR-active irreps: the IR-active irreps are $\\Sigma_u^+$ (for $z$) and $\\Pi_u$ (for $x,y$). Since the symmetric stretch is $\\Sigma_g^+$, it does not transform as $x$, $y$, or $z$, and therefore it is IR-inactive.\n\nConclusion: the symmetric stretching vibration of $\\text{NO}_2^+$ is IR-inactive because it belongs to $\\Sigma_g^+$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2028829"}, {"introduction": "While infrared spectroscopy measures absorption due to changing dipole moments, Raman spectroscopy detects light scattering from changes in a molecule's polarizability.
