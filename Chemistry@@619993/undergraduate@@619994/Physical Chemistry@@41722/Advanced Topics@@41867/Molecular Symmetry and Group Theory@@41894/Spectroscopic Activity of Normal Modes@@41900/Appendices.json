This first practice explores how a molecule's inherent symmetry governs its permanent dipole moment and how its vibrations can create a transient, oscillating dipole moment. By comparing the simple linear molecules $CO_2$, $OCS$, and $N_2O$, you will apply the core selection rules for microwave and infrared spectroscopy, providing a solid conceptual foundation before delving into more formal group theory applications [@problem_id:2004800].", "problem": "Consider three linear triatomic molecules: carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), carbonyl sulfide ($OCS$), and nitrous oxide ($N_2O$). The atomic arrangements are symmetric $O-C-O$ for carbon dioxide, and asymmetric $O-C-S$ for carbonyl sulfide and $N-N-O$ for nitrous oxide. Based on the principles of molecular symmetry and its effect on spectroscopic activity, identify the correct statement among the following options. Note that Infrared is abbreviated as IR.\n\nA. All three molecules exhibit a pure rotational spectrum in the microwave region.\n\nB. The symmetric stretching vibration of $CO_2$ is IR active, while the symmetric stretching vibration of $OCS$ is IR inactive.\n\nC. For $CO_2$, all vibrational modes that are IR active are also Raman active.\n\nD. Both the bending vibrational mode and the asymmetric stretching mode of $CO_2$ are IR active.\n\nE. Both $OCS$ and $N_2O$ are microwave inactive due to their linear geometry.", "solution": "We use three core selection-rule principles.\n\nFirst, for pure rotational (microwave) spectra, the necessary condition is a permanent dipole moment. The selection rule is $\\Delta J=\\pm 1$, but rotational absorption can occur only if the equilibrium dipole moment $\\mu_{0}$ is nonzero:\n$$\n\\mu_{0}\\neq 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{microwave active.}\n$$\nFor a linear centrosymmetric molecule like $CO_{2}$ with structure $O\\!-\\!C\\!-\\!O$, inversion symmetry enforces $\\mu_{0}=0$, so $CO_{2}$ is microwave inactive. In contrast, $OCS$ ($O\\!-\\!C\\!-\\!S$) and $N_{2}O$ ($N\\!-\\!N\\!-\\!O$) are linear but asymmetric, thus $\\mu_{0}\\neq 0$, so they are microwave active. Therefore, option A is false (since $CO_{2}$ is not microwave active) and option E is false (linearity does not cause microwave inactivity; lack of a permanent dipole does).\n\nSecond, for vibrational infrared activity, the criterion for the $k$th normal mode with normal coordinate $Q_{k}$ is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q_{k}}\\right)_{0}\\neq 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{IR active.}\n$$\nFor Raman activity, the criterion is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial Q_{k}}\\right)_{0}\\neq 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Raman active,}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the molecular polarizability tensor. In a centrosymmetric molecule (point group $D_{\\infty h}$ for linear $CO_{2}$), the mutual exclusion principle holds: modes that are IR active (ungerade) are Raman inactive, and modes that are Raman active (gerade) are IR inactive.\n\nThird, we enumerate the normal modes for a linear triatomic. The number of vibrational degrees of freedom is $3N-5$ with $N=3$, giving $4$ vibrational degrees of freedom comprising three fundamentals: one symmetric stretch (non-degenerate), one asymmetric stretch (non-degenerate), and a doubly degenerate bending mode. For $CO_{2}$:\n- The symmetric stretch transforms as gerade; it leaves the dipole at zero at all displacements, so\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q_{\\text{sym}}}\\right)_{0}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{symmetric stretch IR inactive, Raman active.}\n$$\n- The asymmetric stretch transforms as ungerade, producing a change in dipole,\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q_{\\text{asym}}}\\right)_{0}\\neq 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{IR active, Raman inactive.}\n$$\n- The bending mode (doubly degenerate) is also ungerade; it produces a transient dipole on bending,\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q_{\\text{bend}}}\\right)_{0}\\neq 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{IR active, Raman inactive.}\n$$\nThus for $CO_{2}$ the bending and asymmetric stretching modes are IR active, while the symmetric stretch is IR inactive. Consequently, option D is correct, option B is false (it reverses the activity: $CO_{2}$ symmetric stretch is IR inactive, and $OCS$ symmetric stretch, being in a polar molecule, is typically IR active), and option C is false (by mutual exclusion in a centrosymmetric molecule, IR-active modes are not Raman active).\n\nCollecting conclusions:\n- A: false (no permanent dipole for $CO_{2}$).\n- B: false (symmetric stretch of $CO_{2}$ is IR inactive; for $OCS$ it is IR active).\n- C: false (mutual exclusion for $CO_{2}$).\n- D: true (bending and asymmetric stretch of $CO_{2}$ are IR active).\n- E: false ($OCS$ and $N_{2}O$ are polar and microwave active).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2004800"}, {"introduction": "While conceptual rules are powerful, group theory provides a rigorous mathematical framework for predicting spectroscopic activity.

A collective displacement along $z$ transforms as the Cartesian coordinate $z$.\n- In the $D_{3h}$ character table, the $z$ coordinate transforms as the irreducible representation $A_{2}''$. This can be confirmed by examining how $z$ transforms under the symmetry operations:\n  - Under $C_{3}$ rotations, $z$ is unchanged, giving character $+1$.\n  - Under $\\sigma_{h}$ (reflection in the molecular plane), $z \\mapsto -z$, so the representation must be antisymmetric under $\\sigma_{h}$ (double prime).\n  - Under any $C_{2}$ axis lying in the plane, $z \\mapsto -z$, implying character $-1$ for the $3C_{2}$ class.\n  These transformation properties match $A_{2}''$ in the provided table.\n\nTherefore, the out-of-plane bending mode transforms as $A_{2}''$.\n\n2) IR selection rule and activity:\n- A vibrational mode is IR active if the transition dipole moment is symmetry-allowed.
