So, B is correct.\n\nC. $y = (Z-1)V_m$, $x = \\frac{1}{V_m}$: The variables for the plot are correct, but it incorrectly claims that $C(T) = c$. From our derivation, the intercept $c$ is equal to $B(T)$, not $C(T)$. So, C is incorrect.\n\nD. $y = Z-1$, $x = V_m$: The equation is $y = \\frac{B(T)}{x} + \\frac{C(T)}{x^2}$. This is not a linear relationship. So, D is incorrect.\n\nE. $y = \\frac{Z-1}{V_m}$, $x = \\frac{1}{V_m}$: Let's substitute these into the equation $Z-1 = \\frac{B(T)}{V_m} + \\frac{C(T)}{V_m^2}$. Dividing by $V_m$ gives $\\frac{Z-1}{V_m} = \\frac{B(T)}{V_m^2} + \\frac{C(T)}{V_m^3}$. In terms of the proposed variables, this is $y = B(T)x^2 + C(T)x^3$. This is not a linear relationship. An alternative interpretation is to substitute $x=1/V_m$ into the expression for y: $y = \\frac{Z-1}{V_m} = x(Z-1)$. The original equation $Z-1 = Bx + Cx^2$ implies $x(Z-1) = Bx^2 + Cx^3$. So a plot of $y$ vs $x$ is not linear. So, E is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option B provides the correct combination of variables for a linear plot and the correct identification of the third virial coefficient, $C(T)$, as the slope of that plot.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2002241"}]}
