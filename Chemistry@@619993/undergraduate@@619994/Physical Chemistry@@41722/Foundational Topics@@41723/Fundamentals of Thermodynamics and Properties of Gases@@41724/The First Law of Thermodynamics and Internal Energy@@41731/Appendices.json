Adopt the standard physical chemistry sign convention: $q$ is positive when heat is absorbed by the system, and $w$ is positive when work is done on the system. The first law of thermodynamics is written as $\\Delta U = q + w$.\n\nDuring fast charging, the external power supply performs electrical work on the battery, so the work term for the system is positive, hence $w > 0$. Due to inefficiencies, the battery dissipates thermal energy to the surroundings; heat flows out of the system, so $q  0$. Because the process is a net charging process, the battery’s stored chemical/electrostatic energy increases, which implies that the internal energy increases. Using $\\Delta U = q + w$ with $w > 0$ and $q  0$, and recognizing that charging leads to a net gain of stored energy, we conclude $\\Delta U > 0$.\n\nTherefore, the correct signs are $q  0$, $w > 0$, and $\\Delta U > 0$, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2011336"}, {"introduction": "While internal energy is a state function, meaning its change depends only on the initial and final states, work is a path function.
