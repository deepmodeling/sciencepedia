The fundamental principle governing this scenario is the zeroth law of thermodynamics.\n\nThe zeroth law of thermodynamics provides the basis for the concept of temperature. It states that if two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third one, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. A direct consequence of this law is that any two systems in thermal equilibrium must have the same temperature.\n\nLet's identify the thermal contacts in the described setup:\n1.  The alloy A core and the alloy B sleeve are \"tightly fitted and bonded.\" This ensures they are in intimate thermal contact.\n2.  The composite piston (which includes both alloy A and alloy B) is in \"direct contact with the gas.\" This means the outer surface of the piston (alloy B) is in thermal contact with the gas.\n\nThe problem states that the entire system has reached a state of thermal equilibrium. This means that there is no net flow of heat between any parts of the system that are in thermal contact.\n\nLet's apply the definition of thermal equilibrium to the pairs of systems in contact.\nFirst, consider the two parts of the piston. Since the alloy A core and the alloy B sleeve are bonded together and have reached thermal equilibrium, they must be in thermal equilibrium with each other. By definition, two objects in thermal equilibrium have the same temperature. Therefore, we must have:\n$$T_A = T_B$$\n\nNext, consider the piston sleeve and the gas. The sleeve (alloy B) is in direct contact with the gas. Since the system is in thermal equilibrium, the sleeve and the gas must be in thermal equilibrium with each other. This implies their temperatures are equal:\n$$T_B = T_{gas}$$\n\nNow, we can combine these two equalities. From $T_A = T_B$ and $T_B = T_{gas}$, it follows by transitivity that:\n$$T_A = T_B = T_{gas}$$\n\nThis result confirms that when a multi-component system reaches thermal equilibrium, all of its components must share a single, uniform temperature.\n\nLet's analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n- **Option B**: This describes a transient state, not equilibrium. If $T_{gas}$ were greater than the piston's temperature, there would be a net flow of heat from the gas to the piston, which contradicts the definition of thermal equilibrium (no net heat flow).\n- **Option C and E**: Properties like thermal conductivity determine the *rate* at which thermal equilibrium is achieved. A material with high thermal conductivity will reach equilibrium faster. However, these properties do not influence the final temperature at equilibrium. Once equilibrium is established, the temperatures are equal regardless of the path taken to reach that state.\n- **Option D**: Properties like mass and specific heat capacity determine the heat capacity of each component (how much energy is required to change its temperature). These are crucial for calculating the final equilibrium temperature if the systems started at different temperatures, but they do not alter the fact that at equilibrium, the temperatures themselves must be equal.\n\nThus, the only correct statement based on the principles of thermal equilibrium is that all three temperatures are equal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2024134"}, {"introduction": "Having established that temperature is uniform across a static system at equilibrium, we now explore this concept in a more dynamic context. This problem introduces a system where a reversible chemical reaction, $A \\rightleftharpoons B$, is continuously occurring, which might intuitively seem to create local temperature variations due to reaction enthalpy. By considering a system at both chemical and thermal equilibrium [@problem_id:2024127], you will demonstrate that the macroscopic principle of uniform temperature holds even amidst this constant microscopic activity.", "problem": "A rigid, sealed, and diathermal container is filled with a mixture of two gaseous compounds, A and B. These compounds can interconvert through the reversible isomerization reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons B$. The container is submerged in a large, constant-temperature heat bath, and the entire system is allowed to come to a state of stable equilibrium. At this point, both thermal equilibrium and chemical equilibrium have been established. Let $T_A$ be the macroscopic temperature that would be measured by a hypothetical probe sensitive only to the kinetic energy of A molecules, $T_B$ be the corresponding temperature for B molecules, and $T_{bath}$ be the temperature of the heat bath.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between these three temperatures?\n\nA. $T_A = T_B = T_{bath}$\n\nB. $T_A = T_B$, but their common temperature may differ from $T_{bath}$ due to the continuous heat exchange from the ongoing forward and reverse reactions.\n\nC. The relationship depends on the enthalpy of reaction ($\\Delta H_{rxn}$). If the forward reaction $A \\rightarrow B$ is exothermic, then $T_B > T_A$. If it is endothermic, then $T_A > T_B$.\n\nD. The mixture of A and B as a whole has a temperature equal to $T_{bath}$, but the individual temperatures $T_A$ and $T_B$ are unequal and depend on the equilibrium concentrations of A and B.\n\nE. The relationship cannot be determined without knowing the molar masses of A and B.", "solution": "The problem describes a system that has reached a state of stable equilibrium. This state implies that all macroscopic properties, including temperature, are constant over time. The equilibrium is twofold: thermal and chemical.\n\nFirst, let's consider the condition of thermal equilibrium. The container holding the gas mixture is described as diathermal, which means it allows the transfer of heat. It is in contact with a large heat bath at temperature $T_{bath}$. When thermal equilibrium is reached, there is no net flow of heat between the container's contents and the heat bath. This can only happen if the temperature of the gas mixture inside the container is equal to the temperature of the heat bath. Let's call the temperature of the mixture as a whole $T_{mix}$. Therefore, a consequence of thermal equilibrium between the mixture and the bath is $T_{mix} = T_{bath}$.\n\nSecond, let's consider the conditions within the gas mixture itself. The mixture consists of two species, A and B. Temperature is a macroscopic property that reflects the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system. For a gas mixture to be in internal thermal equilibrium, the temperature must be uniform throughout its volume. This uniformity arises from the constant collisions between all particles in the gas. Molecules of A collide with other A molecules, B molecules collide with other B molecules, and, crucially, A molecules collide with B molecules. These collisions lead to the redistribution of kinetic energy until a statistical equilibrium is reached where the average kinetic energy of the A molecules is equal to the average kinetic energy of the B molecules. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy, the macroscopic temperature associated with species A, $T_A$, must be equal to the macroscopic temperature associated with species B, $T_B$. This common temperature is, by definition, the temperature of the mixture, $T_{mix}$. Thus, $T_A = T_B = T_{mix}$.\n\nThe problem also states that the system is at chemical equilibrium. This means the rate of the forward reaction ($A \\rightarrow B$) is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction ($B \\rightarrow A$). While individual reaction events may be exothermic or endothermic (releasing or absorbing heat), at equilibrium, the heat released by the forward reaction is exactly balanced by the heat absorbed by the reverse reaction. Therefore, there is no net heat production or consumption within the mixture due to the chemical reaction, and the reaction does not cause any sustained temperature gradients or differences between the species. The arguments from thermal equilibrium still hold.\n\nCombining our two findings:\n1. From thermal equilibrium with the bath: $T_{mix} = T_{bath}$.\n2. From internal thermal equilibrium of the mixture: $T_A = T_B = T_{mix}$.\n\nUsing the transitive property, which is the essence of the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics, we can conclude that $T_A = T_B = T_{bath}$.\n\nLet's analyze the incorrect options:\n- Option B is incorrect because at thermal equilibrium, the temperature of the system must equal the temperature of the heat bath it is in contact with.\n- Option C is incorrect because it confuses the energy change of a single reactive event with the macroscopic temperature at equilibrium. At equilibrium, the net thermal effect of the reaction is zero.\n- Option D is incorrect because in a mixture at thermal equilibrium, frequent collisions ensure that all components share the same average kinetic energy and thus the same temperature, regardless of their relative concentrations.\n- Option E is incorrect because according to the equipartition theorem, at a given temperature, all species in a thermalized gas mixture have the same average translational kinetic energy, regardless of their mass. While their average speeds will differ, their temperatures will be the same.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is that all three temperatures are equal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2024127"}, {"introduction": "The concept of temperature is one thing; measuring it accurately is another.

However, its internal software is calibrated to calculate temperature by assuming the object is a perfect black body, meaning it uses an emissivity value of $\\epsilon_{cal} = 1$.
