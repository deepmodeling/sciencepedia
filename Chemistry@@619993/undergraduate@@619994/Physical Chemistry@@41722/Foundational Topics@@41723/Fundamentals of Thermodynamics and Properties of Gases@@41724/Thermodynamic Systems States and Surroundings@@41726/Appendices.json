Initially the pure substance (water) is a saturated liquid–vapor mixture at $(T_{0},P_{0})$, so $P_{0}=P_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{0})$. The container is rigid and thermally isolated, and the barrier is inserted without heat exchange and without work.

At final equilibrium, diathermal contact enforces\n$$\nT_{A}=T_{B}\\equiv T.\n$$\nWe are told that both $A$ and $B$ still contain nonzero amounts of both liquid and vapor.

Denote saturated properties at temperature $T$ by $v_{f}(T),v_{g}(T),u_{f}(T),u_{g}(T),h_{f}(T),h_{g}(T)$, and $h_{fg}(T)=h_{g}(T)-h_{f}(T)$.

The right-hand side is a function of $T$ only, built from smooth saturated properties. Initially, at $T=T_{0}$, the equality holds. Because the functions $v_{f}(T),v_{g}(T),h_{f}(T),h_{fg}(T)$ are standard single-valued functions along the saturation line and $v_{g}(T)-v_{f}(T)>0$, $h_{fg}(T)>0$, the above relation determines $T$ uniquely.

Statements B and C contradict the saturation relation. Statement D is false because in a two-phase equilibrium of a pure substance, the pressure depends only on temperature, not on the phase mass ratio, provided both phases are present.

At $t=\\Delta t$, the surroundings are the same for A and B, namely $(T_{0},P_{0},c_{0})$, but the final values of $L$ differ, $L_{B}>L_{A}$. This shows that the final value $L(\\Delta t)$ depends on the time history of the environmental variables, not just on the final surroundings. Therefore, $L$ cannot be a state function of the surroundings variables alone; rather, it is path dependent through the integral over the kinetic rate.\n\nOption A is incorrect: the “final state of the system (mineral + surroundings)” is not the same for A and B, because $L$ itself is part of the mineral’s state, and $L_{A}\\neq L_{B}$. Option B is incorrect: the change in $L$ does depend on the path of the surroundings through $T(t),P(t),c(t)$ as shown by the integrals above. Option D is incorrect: state functions (e.g., internal energy, volume, entropy) are defined for states regardless of whether the processes connecting states are reversible or irreversible; irreversibility does not preclude the existence of state functions. Option E is incorrect: being extensive does not preclude being a state function (e.g., volume and internal energy are extensive state functions).\n\nHence the correct description is that $L$ is path dependent because its final value depends on the history of environmental conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2025240"}]}
