Work ($W$) is a primary way a system exchanges energy with its surroundings, but unlike internal energy, its value is not determined solely by the initial and final states.

The problem states that the constant $c$ is determined by the initial state $(P_1, V_1)$. This means the path passes through this point, so we can substitute these values into the path equation to find $c$:\n$$P_1 = cV_1^2 \\implies c = \\frac{P_1}{V_1^2}$$\nNow we can write the pressure as a function of volume for this specific path:\n$$P(V) = \\frac{P_1}{V_1^2}V^2$$\nThe work done, $W_{para}$, is the integral of this pressure function from the initial volume $V_1$ to the final volume $V_2$:\n$$W_{para} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\left(\\frac{P_1}{V_1^2}V^2\\right) dV$$\nThe term $\\frac{P_1}{V_1^2}$ is a constant, so we can take it out of the integral:\n$$W_{para} = \\frac{P_1}{V_1^2} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^2 dV$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$W_{para} = \\frac{P_1}{V_1^2} \\left[ \\frac{V^3}{3} \\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = \\frac{P_1}{3V_1^2} (V_2^3 - V_1^3)$$\nTo express this in terms of the volume expansion ratio $\\alpha = V_2/V_1$, we can factor out $V_1^3$ from the parenthesis:\n$$W_{para} = \\frac{P_1}{3V_1^2} V_1^3 \\left( \\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)^3 - 1 \\right) = \\frac{P_1V_1}{3} (\\alpha^3 - 1)$$\n\nNext, let's calculate the work done during the reversible isothermal expansion, $W_{iso}$.\nFor an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process, the temperature $T$ is constant.
