We start with $n$ moles of this gas, which can be modeled as an ideal gas, at an initial pressure $P_1$ and held at a constant temperature $T$. The objective is to bring the gas to a final, stable pressure $P_2$, where $P_2 > P_1$.\n\nTwo distinct compression protocols are under evaluation for their energy efficiency:\n\n**Protocol A:** The gas is compressed in a single, rapid step. The external pressure is abruptly increased to the final target pressure $P_2$. This external pressure is then maintained as the gas is compressed until it reaches its final volume, which corresponds to the internal pressure $P_2$.\n\n**Protocol B:** The gas is compressed via a quasi-static process. The external pressure is continuously and infinitesimally adjusted so that it is always negligibly greater than the internal pressure of the gas throughout the entire compression from pressure $P_1$ to $P_2$.\n\nBoth protocols are conducted isothermally at the same temperature $T$.\n\nCalculate the ratio $\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{W_A}{W_B}$, where $W_A$ is the work done *on the system* during Protocol A, and $W_B$ is the work done *on the system* during Protocol B.
