The problem states that all transitions involve an increase in the quantum number $J$ by one. Therefore, for a transition starting from an initial state with quantum number $J_{initial}$, the final state will have a quantum number $J_{final} = J_{initial} + 1$. For simplicity, let's denote the initial quantum number as $J$. The transition is thus from state $J$ to state $J+1$.\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon, $\\Delta E$, must be equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states. The energy levels are given by $E_J = B J(J+1)$.\n$$ \\Delta E(J \\to J+1) = E_{J+1} - E_J $$\nSubstituting the formula for the energy levels:\n$$ \\Delta E(J \\to J+1) = B(J+1)( (J+1)+1 ) - B J(J+1) $$\n$$ \\Delta E(J \\to J+1) = B(J+1)(J+2) - B J(J+1) $$\nWe can factor out the common term $B(J+1)$:\n$$ \\Delta E(J \\to J+1) = B(J+1) [ (J+2) - J ] $$\n$$ \\Delta E(J \\to J+1) = B(J+1)(2) = 2B(J+1) $$\nThis expression gives the energy of an absorption line for a transition originating from the rotational level $J$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the constant energy separation between adjacent absorption lines, $\\Delta E_{sep}$. The absorption spectrum consists of a series of lines corresponding to transitions from $J=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ to $J=1, 2, 3, \\dots$ respectively.\nLet's consider two adjacent transitions: one starting from state $J$ and the next one starting from state $J+1$.\nThe energy for the first transition ($J \\to J+1$) is $\\Delta E_1 = 2B(J+1)$.\nThe energy for the second, adjacent transition ($(J+1) \\to (J+2)$) is found by replacing $J$ with $J+1$ in our general formula:\n$$ \\Delta E_2 = 2B((J+1)+1) = 2B(J+2) $$\nThe energy separation $\\Delta E_{sep}$ is the difference between the energies of these two adjacent lines:\n$$ \\Delta E_{sep} = \\Delta E_2 - \\Delta E_1 = 2B(J+2) - 2B(J+1) $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{sep} = 2B[ (J+2) - (J+1) ] = 2B(J+2-J-1) = 2B(1) = 2B $$\nSo, the constant energy separation between adjacent lines in the rotational absorption spectrum is $2B$.\n\nThe problem states that a specific line is observed at an energy of $2\\Delta E_{sep}$. We can now calculate this energy in terms of $B$:\n$$ E_{obs} = 2\\Delta E_{sep} = 2(2B) = 4B $$\n\nFinally, we must find the quantum numbers of the transition that corresponds to this observed energy. We set our general expression for the transition energy equal to $E_{obs}$:\n$$ \\Delta E(J \\to J+1) = E_{obs} $$\n$$ 2B(J+1) = 4B $$\nSince $B$ is a positive constant, we can divide both sides by $2B$:\n$$ J+1 = 2 $$\n$$ J = 1 $$\nThis value of $J$ represents the initial quantum number of the transition.\nSo, $J_{initial} = 1$.\nThe final quantum number is $J_{final} = J_{initial} + 1 = 1+1 = 2$.\n\nThe transition is from the state with $J_{initial}=1$ to the state with $J_{final}=2$.
