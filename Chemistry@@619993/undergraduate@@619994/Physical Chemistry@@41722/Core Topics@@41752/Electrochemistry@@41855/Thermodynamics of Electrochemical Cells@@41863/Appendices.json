The underlying redox reaction at each electrode is the interconversion of chlorine gas and chloride ions: $Cl_2(g) + 2e^- \\rightleftharpoons 2Cl^-(aq)$.\n\nTo generate a spontaneous positive voltage, the overall cell reaction must proceed in a way that moves the system towards equilibrium. In this case, it means chlorine gas will effectively be transferred from the region of high pressure to the region of low pressure. Therefore, reduction will occur at the high-pressure electrode (cathode), and oxidation will occur at the low-pressure electrode (anode).\n\nThe half-cell with the higher pressure, $p_1 = 1.00$ bar, will act as the cathode.
