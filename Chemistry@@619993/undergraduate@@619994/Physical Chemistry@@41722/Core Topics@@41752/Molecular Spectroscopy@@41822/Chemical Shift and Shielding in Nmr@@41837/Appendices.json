The isomer ethyl formate is expected to show three signals: a singlet, a quartet, and a triplet, with a relative integration ratio of 3:2:1.", "solution": "We consider the three named acyclic isomers with formula $C_{3}H_{6}O_{2}$ and apply the standard $^{1}$H NMR rules: chemically equivalent protons give one signal; the relative area (integration) of each signal is proportional to the number of protons of that type; scalar coupling follows the $n+1$ rule, where a set of $n$ equivalent neighboring protons within three bonds splits a signal into $n+1$ lines; coupling beyond three bonds is neglected; and exchangeable protons on oxygen (e.g., in carboxylic acids) do not couple with other protons.\n\nPropanoic acid, $CH_{3}CH_{2}COOH$: There are three distinct sets of protons: $CH_{3}$ (3 H), $CH_{2}$ (2 H), and $OH$ (1 H). By assumption, the $OH$ proton does not couple, so it appears as a singlet integrating to $1$. The $CH_{2}$ group is coupled only to the adjacent $CH_{3}$ (the carbonyl carbon has no hydrogens, and $OH$ is more than three bonds away and exchangeable), so with $n=3$ neighbors, the $CH_{2}$ signal is a quartet integrating to $2$. The $CH_{3}$ group is coupled only to the adjacent $CH_{2}$ with $n=2$, giving a triplet integrating to $3$. Therefore, propanoic acid gives three signals: singlet ($1$ H, $OH$), quartet ($2$ H, $CH_{2}$), triplet ($3$ H, $CH_{3}$). This contradicts option A (which assigns a singlet of $3$ H and two triplets, including a $1$ H triplet) and option D (which claims only two signals; the $OH$ is typically observed as a broad singlet even if it does not couple).\n\nMethyl acetate, $CH_{3}COOCH_{3}$: There are two distinct methyl groups: the acetyl methyl $CH_{3}CO-$ (3 H) and the methoxy $-OCH_{3}$ (3 H). Each group has no vicinal protons to couple to: the acetyl methyl is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (no hydrogens), and the methoxy methyl is adjacent to oxygen (no vicinal $C$–$H$). Coupling across four bonds or through oxygen is neglected by the given assumption. Thus, both methyl groups appear as singlets, each integrating to $3$, giving two singlets with relative integration $3:3$, i.e., $1:1$. This matches option B and contradicts option E (which incorrectly claims a single signal for all six protons).\n\nEthyl formate, $HCOOCH_{2}CH_{3}$: There are three distinct sets: formyl $H$ (1 H), $CH_{2}$ next to oxygen (2 H), and terminal $CH_{3}$ (3 H). The formyl $H$ has no coupling partners within three bonds (coupling to $CH_{2}$ would be across four bonds via $H$–$C(=O)$–$O$–$CH_{2}$ and is neglected), so it appears as a singlet integrating to $1$. The $CH_{2}$ group is coupled to the adjacent $CH_{3}$ only (3 equivalent neighbors, $n=3$), so it is a quartet integrating to $2$. The $CH_{3}$ group is coupled to the adjacent $CH_{2}$ only ($n=2$), so it is a triplet integrating to $3$. Therefore, ethyl formate shows singlet ($1$ H), quartet ($2$ H), and triplet ($3$ H), with integration ratio $1:2:3$. This contradicts option C (which incorrectly lists a doublet) and option F (which incorrectly assigns the singlet as $3$ H).\n\nTherefore, only the description in option B is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1974319"}, {"introduction": "The chemical shift value is a rich source of information about a nucleus's local electronic environment. To truly understand shielding, we must look at the underlying physical principles that govern it. This problem explores the famously anomalous upfield shift of protons in cyclopropane, using a model to dissect the observed $\\delta$ value into distinct contributions from C-H bond hybridization and the magnetic anisotropy generated by the strained ring current. By engaging with this quantitative model, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how subtle changes in bonding and geometry translate into measurable differences in an NMR spectrum [@problem_id:1974338].", "problem": "In Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the chemical shift ($\\delta$) of a nucleus is a sensitive probe of its local electronic environment. Protons in cyclopropane exhibit a famously anomalous upfield chemical shift (a smaller $\\delta$ value) compared to protons in analogous acyclic alkanes like propane. This can be explained by a combination of changes in C-H bond hybridization and magnetic anisotropy from the strained ring system.\n\nConsider a simplified model to predict the chemical shift of a proton in cyclopropane. The predicted shift, $\\delta_{\\text{pred}}$, is given by the sum of three contributions:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{pred}} = \\delta_{\\text{ref}} + \\Delta\\delta_{\\text{hyb}} + \\Delta\\delta_{\\text{aniso}} $$\n\nHere are the definitions and parameters for the model:\n1.  $\\delta_{\\text{ref}}$ is the reference chemical shift for a standard secondary (methylene, -CH$_2$-) proton in a non-strained, acyclic alkane. We will use the methylene proton in propane as our reference, for which $\\delta_{\\text{ref}} = 1.30$ ppm. This reference proton is attached to a carbon atom with ideal sp$^3$ hybridization, meaning the C-H bonding orbital has a fractional s-character of $s_{\\text{ref}} = 0.25$.\n\n2.  $\\Delta\\delta_{\\text{hyb}}$ is the change in chemical shift due to the difference in the C-H bond hybridization between cyclopropane and the reference alkane. Increased s-character in a C-H bonding orbital deshields the proton, increasing its chemical shift. This effect is modeled by the linear relationship:\n    $$ \\Delta\\delta_{\\text{hyb}} = C \\times (s_{\\text{cyclo}} - s_{\\text{ref}}) $$\n    where $s_{\\text{cyclo}}$ is the fractional s-character of the C-H bonding orbital in cyclopropane and the empirical constant $C = 17.0$ ppm. For a carbon atom with two equivalent C-H bonds forming an angle $\\theta_{\\text{HCH}}$, the fractional s-character $s$ of the corresponding hybrid orbitals is given by Coulson's relationship: $\\cos(\\theta_{\\text{HCH}}) = -\\frac{s}{1-s}$. In cyclopropane, the H-C-H bond angle is $\\theta_{\\text{HCH}} = 115^\\circ$.\n\n3.  $\\Delta\\delta_{\\text{aniso}}$ represents the contribution from the magnetic anisotropy of the cyclopropane ring. The strained C-C bonds support a diamagnetic ring current that creates a strong shielding effect for the protons located above and below the ring plane. For this model, this contribution is given as a constant value: $\\Delta\\delta_{\\text{aniso}} = -1.88$ ppm.\n\nUsing this model and the provided parameters, calculate the predicted chemical shift, $\\delta_{\\text{pred}}$, for a proton in cyclopropane.
