We begin our hands-on exploration with the foundational principle of spin-spin splitting: the $n+1$ rule. This simple rule is remarkably powerful, allowing us to predict the multiplicity of a proton's signal based on the number, $n$, of chemically equivalent protons on adjacent atoms. This first exercise [@problem_id:2005069] provides a classic pedagogical example, challenging you to apply the $n+1$ rule to a simple, symmetric molecule and laying the groundwork for interpreting more intricate spectra.", "problem": "In a chemical laboratory, a researcher is tasked with confirming the identity of a purified liquid sample believed to be diethyl ether, which has the chemical structure $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$. The primary analytical method to be used is high-resolution Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^1$H NMR) spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the local chemical environment of hydrogen nuclei (protons). In such a spectrum, the signal for a given set of protons is \"split\" into multiple lines by the magnetic influence of non-equivalent protons on adjacent atoms.\n\nAssuming standard coupling behavior where only protons on adjacent carbons cause splitting, predict the spin-spin splitting patterns for the methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$) protons and the methylene ($\\text{CH}_2$) protons in the $^1$H NMR spectrum of diethyl ether.\n\nA.
