This molecule is being considered for use in a new generation of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The investigation involves an absorption experiment where the molecule, initially in its ground electronic state and lowest vibrational level ($v''=0$), is excited to its first excited electronic state by a photon.\n\nThrough computational modeling, the potential energy curves for the ground electronic state ($V''$) and the first excited electronic state ($V'$) are approximated as harmonic oscillators.

The transition will be to a dissociative continuum of the excited state, resulting in a single, very broad absorption band with no discernible vibrational structure.\n\nE. All observed vibrational transitions ($v''=0 \\to v'$) will have approximately equal intensity.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the vibrational structure of an electronic absorption spectrum based on the Franck-Condon principle and the given equilibrium bond lengths of the ground and excited states.\n\nStep 1: Understand the Franck-Condon Principle.\nThe Franck-Condon principle states that electronic transitions occur on a timescale much shorter than the period of nuclear motion. As a result, the internuclear distance and the momenta of the nuclei do not change during the transition. On a potential energy versus internuclear distance diagram, this is represented as a \"vertical transition\".\n\nStep 2: Characterize the Initial State.\nThe molecule is initially in its ground electronic state and the lowest vibrational level ($v''=0$). For a quantum harmonic oscillator, the probability density function for the ground state, $|\\psi_{v''=0}(r)|^2$, is centered at the equilibrium bond length, $r_e''$. This means the most probable internuclear distance for the molecule in its initial state is $r = r_e'' = 131 \\text{ pm}$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Vertical Transition.\nAccording to the Franck-Condon principle, the most probable electronic transition will originate from the most probable nuclear configuration of the initial state. Therefore, the transition will occur vertically from the point $(r=r_e'', V''(r_e''))$ on the ground state potential energy curve. This vertical line intersects the excited state potential energy curve, $V'(r)$, at the same internuclear distance, $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$.\n\nStep 4: Examine the Final State on the Excited Potential Energy Curve.\nThe equilibrium bond length of the excited state is $r_e' = 115 \\text{ pm}$. The vertical transition terminates at $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$ on the excited state curve. Since $r_e' < r_e''$ ($115 \\text{ pm} < 131 \\text{ pm}$), the transition ends on the outer, repulsive wall of the excited state's potential well, significantly displaced from its minimum.\n\nStep 5: Relate Transition Probability to Wavefunction Overlap.\nThe intensity of a particular vibronic transition ($v'' \\to v'$) is proportional to the square of the overlap integral between the initial and final vibrational wavefunctions, $|\\int \\psi_{v'}^*(r) \\psi_{v''}(r) dr|^2$. This is known as the Franck-Condon factor. For our case, the initial state is $\\psi_{v''=0}$, which has its maximum amplitude at $r=r_e''$. To have a large overlap, the final state wavefunction, $\\psi_{v'}(r)$, must also have a significant amplitude at this same position, $r=r_e''$.\n\nStep 6: Determine the Most Likely Final Vibrational Level ($v'$).\nLet's consider the wavefunctions of the excited state.\n- The ground vibrational wavefunction of the excited state, $\\psi_{v'=0}(r)$, has its maximum amplitude at the minimum of the potential well, $r_e' = 115 \\text{ pm}$. This position is far from the transition coordinate $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$. Therefore, the overlap between $\\psi_{v''=0}$ and $\\psi_{v'=0}$ will be small, resulting in a low-intensity $0-0$ transition.\n- For higher vibrational levels ($v'>0$), the wavefunctions have significant amplitudes near the classical turning points (the points on the potential curve where the total energy equals the potential energy). The vertical transition terminates at $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$ on the outer wall of the $V'$ potential. This point will be a classical turning point for some intermediate vibrational level, let's call it $v'_{max}$. The wavefunction for this level, $\\psi_{v'_{max}}(r)$, will have a large amplitude at $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$.\n- Consequently, the overlap integral $|\\langle \\psi_{v'_{max}} | \\psi_{v''=0} \\rangle|^2$ will be maximized for this intermediate $v'_{max}$, leading to the most intense transition. The intensity will be lower for transitions to $v'$ levels both below and above $v'_{max}$.\n- The transition does not necessarily lead to dissociation (Option D) unless the vertical transition energy exceeds the dissociation energy of the excited state, which is not stated. A distinct vibrational progression is expected.\n- Option C is too strong; the overlap for the 0-0 transition is small, not necessarily zero.\n- Option E is incorrect because the overlap integrals will vary significantly with $v'$.\n\nConclusion: The absorption spectrum will show a progression of peaks. The $0-0$ transition will be present but weak. The intensity will rise to a maximum for a transition to an intermediate vibrational level ($v'>0$) and then fall off for higher $v'$ values.
