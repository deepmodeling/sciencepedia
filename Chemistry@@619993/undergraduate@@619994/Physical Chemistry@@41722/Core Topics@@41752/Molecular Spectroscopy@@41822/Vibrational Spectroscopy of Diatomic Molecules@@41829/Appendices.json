The process involves three main steps: first, determining the vibrational frequency of the molecule from the given wavenumbers; second, relating this to the energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator; and third, calculating the energy of the ground vibrational state ($v=0$).\n\nThe observed spectroscopic signal is a Stokes line, which occurs when a molecule absorbs energy from an incident photon, resulting in the scattered photon having lower energy (and thus a lower wavenumber). The energy difference corresponds to a vibrational excitation of the molecule. The change in wavenumber, $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$, is the difference between the incident wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{incident}}$, and the Stokes-scattered wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}}$.
