This problem [@problem_id:1464134] allows you to practice applying this rule to determine the splitting pattern for a proton in a common organic structure.", "problem": "In the field of organic chemistry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a crucial analytical technique for structure elucidation. A key aspect of interpreting a proton ($^{1}\\text{H}$) NMR spectrum is understanding spin-spin coupling, which causes the resonance signal of a proton to split into multiple peaks. For systems exhibiting first-order coupling, this splitting pattern, known as the signal's multiplicity, can be predicted by the 'n+1 rule'. In this rule, 'n' represents the total number of chemically non-equivalent protons on adjacent atoms.\n\nConsider the compound 2-bromopropane, with the chemical structure $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH(Br)CH}_3$.

This is often due to dynamic processes, such as rapid chemical exchange, occurring on the NMR timescale. This practice problem [@problem_id:2192096] explores the classic case of an alcohol's hydroxyl proton, explaining why it often appears as a broad singlet rather than a distinct multiplet and how the simple technique of a $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ shake can be used to confirm its identity.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is tasked with characterizing a pure sample of an unknown primary alcohol using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The ${}^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum, recorded in a standard deuterated chloroform ($\\text{CDCl}_3$) solvent, displays a series of signals. One particular signal, identified as belonging to the hydroxyl (-OH) proton, appears as a broad singlet at a chemical shift of approximately 2.5 ppm. Based on the molecular structure determined by other means, the student expected this -OH proton to be a triplet due to its proximity to a methylene ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$) group. Puzzled by this discrepancy, the student adds a single drop of deuterium oxide ($\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$) to the NMR tube, shakes it vigorously, and re-acquires the ${}^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum. Upon inspection of the new spectrum, the broad singlet at 2.5 ppm has completely disappeared, while the other signals in the spectrum remain largely unchanged.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and comprehensive explanation for both observations: (1) the appearance of the hydroxyl proton as a broad singlet instead of a triplet, and (2) the disappearance of this signal upon addition of $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$?\n\nA. The broadness and lack of splitting are due to rapid chemical exchange of the hydroxyl proton with other alcohol molecules or trace acidic impurities, which occurs on a timescale faster than the NMR experiment can resolve individual spin-spin couplings. The signal disappears because the exchange with $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ replaces the hydroxyl proton with a deuterium atom, which is not detected by a ${}^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR spectrometer.\n\nB. The hydroxyl proton is involved in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which significantly broadens its resonance signal. The addition of $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ strengthens these hydrogen bonds to such an extent that the proton's resonance frequency is shifted outside the standard spectral window, causing it to \"disappear.\"\n\nC. The natural abundance of the oxygen-17 isotope (${}^{17}\\text{O}$), which has a nuclear quadrupole moment, couples to the hydroxyl proton and causes severe signal broadening, masking any proton-proton splitting. The signal disappears because $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ catalyzes a decomposition reaction that cleaves the C-O bond.\n\nD. The exchange of the hydroxyl proton is slow on the NMR timescale, creating a complex mixture of environments that manifest as a single broad peak. The addition of $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ acts as a quenching agent, which stops the resonance of the hydroxyl proton through a magnetic relaxation mechanism.\n\nE. The signal is a triplet, but the outer lines are broadened into the baseline due to poor magnetic field shimming, leaving only the central peak visible as a broad singlet. The $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ improves the field homogeneity by providing a better lock signal for the spectrometer, which sharpens the peak so much that its intensity falls below the noise level.", "solution": "Expected splitting: If the hydroxyl proton were magnetically coupled to two equivalent methylene protons, the simple $n+1$ rule predicts a triplet, with splitting $J_{\\text{OH-CH}_2}$. However, hydroxyl protons in protic systems undergo proton exchange. Let $k_{\\text{ex}}$ be the exchange rate for $R\\text{-}OH \\rightleftharpoons R\\text{-}O^{-} + H^{+}$ mediated transfer between different molecules/environments (e.g., $R\\text{-}OH + R'\\text{-}OH \\rightleftharpoons R\\text{-}O^{-} + R'\\text{-}OH_{2}^{+}$ or via trace acid/water). When $k_{\\text{ex}} \\gg J_{\\text{OH-CH}_2}$ (more rigorously $k_{\\text{ex}} \\gg 2\\pi J_{\\text{OH-CH}_2}$ in angular frequency units), scalar coupling evolution is averaged out on the NMR timescale, so the OH resonance collapses from a multiplet to an apparent singlet. In addition, OH protons sample multiple chemical environments (free and hydrogen-bonded) with different chemical shifts that interconvert. Denote the chemical shift difference in angular frequency by $\\Delta \\omega$ and the populations by $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$. Chemical exchange contributes to transverse relaxation according to\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu_{1/2}=\\frac{1}{\\pi T_{2}^{*}}=\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left(R_{2,0}+R_{2,\\text{ex}}\\right),\\quad R_{2,\\text{ex}}=p_{1}p_{2}\\frac{(\\Delta \\omega)^{2}k_{\\text{ex}}}{k_{\\text{ex}}^{2}+\\Delta \\omega^{2}},\n$$\nwhich grows large near the intermediate exchange regime $k_{\\text{ex}}\\sim \\Delta \\omega$, producing a broad resonance. Thus, the observed broad singlet is explained by exchange that is fast relative to $J_{\\text{OH-CH}_2}$ (collapsing the coupling) and in a regime that adds significant $R_{2,\\text{ex}}$ broadening.\n\nEffect of $\\text{D}_{2}\\text{O}$: Adding $\\text{D}_{2}\\text{O}$ drives rapid H/D exchange,\n$$\nR\\text{-}OH + \\text{D}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons R\\text{-}OD + \\text{HOD},\n$$\nreplacing the exchangeable hydroxyl proton with deuterium. Deuterium has spin $I=1$ and a different resonance frequency; a standard $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR experiment does not detect deuterium, so the OH proton signal disappears from the $^{1}\\text{H}$ spectrum. Other $^{1}\\text{H}$ signals remain largely unchanged, except for minor secondary effects (e.g., very small changes in nearby couplings or chemical shifts), which is consistent with the observation.\n\nWhy the alternatives are incorrect: \n- Strong hydrogen bonding alone (option B) can broaden signals but does not shift the resonance outside the spectral window, and the disappearance upon $\\text{D}_{2}\\text{O}$ addition is due to isotope exchange, not an extreme shift. \n- Coupling to $^{17}\\text{O}$ (option C) is negligible due to its very low natural abundance and would not systematically erase the OH peak; $\\text{D}_{2}\\text{O}$ does not catalyze C–O bond cleavage under these conditions. \n- Slow exchange (option D) is inconsistent with loss of scalar coupling and with the typical broad singlet appearance; there is no mechanism by which $\\text{D}_{2}\\text{O}$ “quenches” proton resonance via relaxation to make it disappear in $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR. \n- Poor shimming and lock improvement by $\\text{D}_{2}\\text{O}$ (option E) cannot account for complete disappearance of only the OH signal; intensity cannot be “sharpened” below noise in a manner that removes just that peak, and CDCl$_{3}$ already provides a deuterium lock.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately and comprehensively explains both the broad singlet and its disappearance upon $\\text{D}_{2}\\text{O}$ addition is the rapid exchange and H/D exchange explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2192096"}]}
