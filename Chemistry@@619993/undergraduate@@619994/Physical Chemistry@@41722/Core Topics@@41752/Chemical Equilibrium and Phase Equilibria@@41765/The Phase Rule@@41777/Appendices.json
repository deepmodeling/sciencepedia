While the standard rule accounts for variations in both temperature and pressure, many experiments are conducted under constraints, such as constant pressure. This exercise [@problem_id:2017449] introduces the concept of the 'condensed phase rule', a crucial modification for systems where one variable is fixed, demonstrating how such constraints reduce a system's degrees of freedom and define invariant points in phase diagrams.", "id": "2017449", "problem": "A materials scientist is studying the phase behavior of a new binary alloy system composed of two non-reacting metals, call them A and B. The entire experimental investigation is conducted in a furnace that maintains a constant ambient pressure. The scientist observes that at a particular temperature, the system becomes invariant, meaning it possesses zero degrees of freedom. At this specific invariant point, a liquid phase is found to be in equilibrium with one or more solid phases. Given that the number of components in the system is two, determine the total number of phases coexisting in equilibrium at this invariant point.\n\n", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of phases present in a two-component system at an invariant point under constant pressure. The governing principle for this scenario is the Gibbs Phase Rule.\n\nThe standard form of the Gibbs Phase Rule is given by:\n$$F = C - P + 2$$\nwhere:\n- $F$ is the number of degrees of freedom (variance) of the system. This represents the number of intensive variables (like temperature, pressure, or composition) that can be changed independently without altering the number of phases in equilibrium.\n- $C$ is the number of components, which are the chemically independent constituents of the system.\n- $P$ is the number of phases, which are the homogeneous, physically distinct parts of the system.\n\nThe `+2` term in the standard equation accounts for the two intensive variables that are typically considered: temperature and pressure.\n\nIn this problem, a crucial constraint is given: the experiment is conducted at a constant pressure. This means that pressure is not a variable that can be changed independently. Consequently, one degree of freedom is already fixed. When one intensive variable is held constant, we use a modified version of the phase rule, often called the condensed phase rule. This is derived by subtracting 1 from the standard rule to account for the fixed variable:\n$$F' = C - P + 1$$\nHere, $F'$ represents the number of degrees of freedom under the specified constraint (constant pressure).\n\nWe are given the following information from the problem statement:\n- The system is invariant, which means the number of degrees of freedom is zero. So, $F' = 0$.\n- The system is a binary alloy, meaning it has two components. So, $C = 2$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the condensed phase rule equation to solve for $P$, the number of phases.\n$$0 = 2 - P + 1$$\n$$0 = 3 - P$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $P$:\n$$P = 3$$\n\nTherefore, for a two-component system at constant pressure to be invariant, there must be exactly three phases in equilibrium. These phases could be, for example, two solid phases and one liquid phase (a eutectic or peritectic point), or one solid phase, one liquid phase and a vapor phase, although in metallic systems at atmospheric pressure, the vapor phase is often ignored. The problem states that a liquid phase is in equilibrium with solid phases, which is consistent with this result (e.g., two solids and one liquid).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$"}, {"introduction": "Real-world chemical systems often involve reactions, which adds a layer of complexity to phase equilibrium analysis. In such cases, the number of components ($C$) is no longer simply the count of all chemical species present.

This can be determined using the Gibbs Phase Rule.\n\nThe Gibbs Phase Rule is given by the equation:\n$F = C - P + 2$\nwhere:\n- $F$ is the number of degrees of freedom (the number of independent intensive variables, such as temperature, pressure, or concentration, that can be varied without changing the number of phases in the system).\n- $C$ is the number of components (the minimum number of independent chemical species needed to define the composition of all phases in the system).\n- $P$ is the number of phases present at equilibrium.\n\nOur first step is to identify the number of phases ($P$) and the number of components ($C$) for the described system.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of phases (P)**\nA phase is a physically distinct and mechanically separable portion of a system with uniform chemical and physical properties. In this system, we have:\n1.  A solid phase consisting of pure ammonium carbamate ($NH_2COONH_4(s)$).\n2.  A gas phase which is a mixture of ammonia ($NH_3(g)$), carbon dioxide ($CO_2(g)$), and Argon ($Ar(g)$).\n\nTherefore, there are two distinct phases present at equilibrium.\n$P = 2$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of components (C)**\nFor a system involving chemical reactions, the number of components $C$ is not simply the number of chemical substances. It is calculated as:\n$C = N - R$\nwhere:\n- $N$ is the total number of distinct chemical species.\n- $R$ is the number of independent chemical equilibria connecting these species.\n\nFirst, let's list all the chemical species present in the system:\n1.  Ammonium carbamate ($NH_2COONH_4$)\n2.  Ammonia ($NH_3$)\n3.  Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$)\n4.  Argon ($Ar$)\n\nSo, the total number of chemical species is $N = 4$.\n\nNext, we identify the number of independent chemical equilibria. There is one reaction given:\n$NH_2COONH_4(s) \\rightleftharpoons 2 NH_3(g) + CO_2(g)$\nThis equilibrium provides a constraint on the concentrations of the species involved. Thus, the number of independent reactions is $R = 1$.\n\nIt is important to note that there are no other constraints on the composition. Specifically, the problem does not state that the system was formed solely by the decomposition of ammonium carbamate. If it were, an additional stoichiometric constraint would exist (e.g., the molar ratio of $NH_3$ to $CO_2$ in the gas phase would be fixed at 2:1). Since an arbitrary amount of argon has been added, and there's no information about how the system was prepared, we cannot assume such a stoichiometric relationship. The relative amounts of $NH_3$, $CO_2$, and $Ar$ in the gas phase are independent, subject only to the chemical equilibrium constraint.\n\nNow we can calculate the number of components:\n$C = N - R = 4 - 1 = 3$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the degrees of freedom (F)**\nNow we substitute the values of $C$ and $P$ into the Gibbs Phase Rule equation:\n$F = C - P + 2$\n$F = 3 - 2 + 2$\n$F = 3$\n\nThus, the system has 3 degrees of freedom. This means that we can independently vary three intensive variables (for example, temperature, total pressure, and the mole fraction of Argon in the gas phase) while still maintaining the equilibrium between the solid and gas phases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$"}]}
