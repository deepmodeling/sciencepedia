Cooling curves, which plot temperature versus time as a sample solidifies, provide a direct window into phase transformations. This practice will sharpen your ability to \"read\" these thermal signatures, helping you distinguish between the straightforward solidification of a pure substance, the unique isothermal freezing of a eutectic mixture, and the more complex multi-stage cooling seen in off-eutectic and peritectic systems [@problem_id:1980450]. Mastering this skill is fundamental to connecting experimental observations with the theoretical framework of phase diagrams.", "problem": "A materials scientist performs a series of calorimetry experiments to study the solidification behavior of three different molten metallic samples, designated Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Each sample is initially a homogeneous liquid at a high temperature in a furnace and is then allowed to cool under conditions where heat is extracted at a constant rate. An accurate temperature probe records the thermal history of each sample. The key observations are summarized below:\n\n*   **Sample Alpha**: The temperature of the liquid decreases steadily until it reaches $1085\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$. At this specific temperature, a thermal arrest occurs, and the temperature remains constant until the entire sample has solidified. Once solidification is complete, the temperature of the solid sample resumes its steady decrease.\n\n*   **Sample Beta**: The temperature of the liquid decreases steadily until it reaches $950\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$. At this point, the rate of temperature decrease becomes significantly smaller, but the temperature continues to fall. This slower cooling persists until the sample temperature reaches $780\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, at which point a second thermal arrest occurs; the temperature now holds constant until all the remaining liquid solidifies.\n\n*   **Sample Gamma**: The temperature of the liquid decreases steadily until it reaches $1020\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$. At this temperature, a thermal arrest occurs, during which a solid phase forms via a reaction involving the liquid. This process continues for some time at constant temperature, but before the entire sample solidifies, the temperature begins to decrease again. Finally, at $780\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, a second, final thermal arrest occurs, and the remainder of the sample solidifies at this constant temperature.\n\nBased on these observations from the cooling experiments, which of the following statements provides the most accurate classification of the samples?\n\nA. Sample Alpha is a pure substance, Sample Beta is a eutectic mixture, Sample Gamma is a hypereutectic mixture.\n\nB. Sample Alpha is a eutectic mixture, Sample Beta is a hypoeutectic mixture, Sample Gamma exhibits a phase diagram with an incongruently melting compound.\n\nC. Sample Alpha could be either a pure substance or a mixture at its eutectic composition, Sample Beta is a mixture with a non-eutectic (hypoeutectic or hypereutectic) composition, and Sample Gamma exhibits a phase diagram with an incongruently melting compound.\n\nD.

During a first-order phase change that is isothermal, the removed heat goes into latent heat $L$ at fixed temperature, so while the transformation proceeds, $dT/dt=0$ and a thermal arrest (plateau) appears, with\n$$\nP\\,\\Delta t = mL\n$$\nfor the portion that solidifies isothermally. In alloy systems with a freezing range, solidification begins at the liquidus temperature $T_{L}$ and proceeds to the solidus temperature $T_{S}$ with $T_{S}<T_{L}$. Latent heat is then released progressively over a temperature interval, which reduces the magnitude of $\\frac{dT}{dt}$ but does not drive it to zero; an isothermal arrest occurs only for invariant reactions such as a eutectic ($L\\to\\alpha+\\beta$ at $T_{e}$) or a peritectic ($L+\\alpha\\to\\beta$ at $T_{p}$).\n\nApply these principles to the observations:\n\nSample Alpha shows steady cooling to a single temperature, followed by an isothermal arrest until the entire sample has solidified, then steady cooling resumes. A single isothermal transformation completing all solidification indicates either a pure substance solidifying at its melting point (one invariant temperature where the entire mass transforms) or a eutectic alloy at exactly the eutectic composition $C_{e}$, for which cooling is sensible down to $T_{e}$ and then the entire liquid transforms isothermally to the eutectic mixture. From the cooling curve alone, these two cases are indistinguishable, so Alpha could be either a pure substance or a eutectic-composition mixture.\n\nSample Beta shows steady cooling to a first characteristic temperature $T_{L}$, then a markedly reduced but nonzero cooling rate from $T_{L}$ down to a lower temperature $T_{e}$, followed by an isothermal arrest at $T_{e}$ until solidification completes. The reduced cooling rate between $T_{L}$ and $T_{e}$ signifies progressive release of latent heat across a freezing range (solidification begins at the liquidus and proceeds to the solidus), which is characteristic of an alloy with a non-eutectic composition. The final isothermal arrest at $T_{e}$ corresponds to the eutectic reaction consuming the remaining liquid. Such behavior is consistent with either a hypoeutectic or a hypereutectic composition; in any case, it is a non-eutectic mixture.\n\nSample Gamma shows an isothermal arrest at an intermediate temperature $T_{p}$ where a solid forms via a reaction involving the liquid, but the arrest ends before the entire sample solidifies; cooling then resumes until a second, final arrest at $T_{e}$ completes solidification. An isothermal reaction of $L$ with an existing solid to form a different solid at $T_{p}$ is the defining feature of a peritectic reaction, which occurs in systems containing an incongruently melting compound. The subsequent eutectic arrest at $T_{e}$ completes the transformation of the remaining liquid. Therefore, Gamma exhibits a phase diagram with an incongruently melting (peritectic) compound.\n\nThese classifications match: Alpha could be either a pure substance or a eutectic-composition mixture; Beta is a non-eutectic (hypoeutectic or hypereutectic) mixture; Gamma exhibits a peritectic (incongruent melting) compound.
