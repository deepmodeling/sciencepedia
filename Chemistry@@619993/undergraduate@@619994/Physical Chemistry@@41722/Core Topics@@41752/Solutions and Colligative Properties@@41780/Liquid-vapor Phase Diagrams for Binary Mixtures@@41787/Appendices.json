Preliminary experimental data shows that at the intended operating pressure of the distillation column, the relative volatility, $\\alpha_{AB}$, of this mixture is consistently 1.0 across the entire range of possible compositions. The relative volatility is defined by the expression:\n$$ \\alpha_{AB} = \\frac{y_A / x_A}{y_B / x_B} $$\nwhere $x_A$ and $x_B$ are the mole fractions of components A and B in the liquid phase, and $y_A$ and $y_B$ are the mole fractions of the same components in the vapor phase in equilibrium with the liquid.\n\nBased on this single piece of information, what is the most accurate conclusion the engineer can draw about the feasibility of separating this mixture using a standard distillation process?\n\nA.
