The separation power of a column is quantified by its number of 'theoretical plates,' with each plate representing an ideal equilibrium stage.

The vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) for this system can be accurately modeled by assuming a constant relative volatility, $\\alpha$. The relative volatility is defined as $\\alpha = (y_A/x_A) / (y_B/x_B)$, where $y_i$ and $x_i$ represent the mole fractions of component $i$ in the vapor and liquid phases, respectively.
