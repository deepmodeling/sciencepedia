This exercise is a fundamental check of your understanding of the law's different formulations. By converting the constant from a mole fraction basis ($K_{H,x}$) to a molarity basis ($K_{H,c}$), you will practice essential unit analysis and reinforce the connection between a gas's mole fraction and its molar concentration in a dilute solution [@problem_id:1983973].", "problem": "The solubility of gases in liquids is a crucial concept in many fields, from beverage manufacturing to environmental science. Henry's law describes the equilibrium partitioning of a volatile solute between the gas and liquid phases. One common form of the law is $p_i = K_{H,x} \\cdot x_i$, where $p_i$ is the partial pressure of the gas, $x_i$ is its mole fraction in the liquid, and $K_{H,x}$ is the Henry's law constant based on mole fraction.\n\nFor carbon dioxide (CO2) in water at a temperature of $298.15$ K, the Henry's law constant $K_{H,x}$ is approximately $1.67 \\times 10^3$ bar.\n\nAnother common form of Henry's law is expressed in terms of molar concentration: $c_i = K_{H,c} \\cdot p_i$, where $c_i$ is the molar concentration of the gas in the liquid and $K_{H,c}$ is the corresponding constant.

We are given the constant $K_{H,x}$ in the mole fraction-based form and need to find the constant $K_{H,c}$ in the concentration-based form.\n\nThe two forms of Henry's law are given as:\n1.  $p_{\\text{CO}_2} = K_{H,x} \\cdot x_{\\text{CO}_2}$\n2.  $c_{\\text{CO}_2} = K_{H,c} \\cdot p_{\\text{CO}_2}$\n\nHere, $p_{\\text{CO}_2}$ is the partial pressure of CO2, $x_{\\text{CO}_2}$ is its mole fraction in the aqueous solution, and $c_{\\text{CO}_2}$ is its molar concentration in the solution.\n\nOur goal is to find a relationship between $K_{H,x}$ and $K_{H,c}$. We can start by expressing $p_{\\text{CO}_2}$ from the second equation and equating it with the first:\n$p_{\\text{CO}_2} = \\frac{c_{\\text{CO}_2}}{K_{H,c}}$\nSetting the two expressions for $p_{\\text{CO}_2}$ equal to each other gives:\n$K_{H,x} \\cdot x_{\\text{CO}_2} = \\frac{c_{\\text{CO}_2}}{K_{H,c}}$\nThis can be rearranged to express $K_{H,c}$ in terms of the other quantities:\n$K_{H,c} = \\frac{c_{\\text{CO}_2}}{x_{\\text{CO}_2}} \\frac{1}{K_{H,x}}$\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between concentration $c_{\\text{CO}_2}$ and mole fraction $x_{\\text{CO}_2}$.\nThe definitions are:\n$c_{\\text{CO}_2} = \\frac{n_{\\text{CO}_2}}{V_{\\text{solution}}}$\n$x_{\\text{CO}_2} = \\frac{n_{\\text{CO}_2}}{n_{\\text{CO}_2} + n_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}$\nwhere $n_{\\text{CO}_2}$ and $n_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$ are the moles of CO2 and water, respectively, and $V_{\\text{solution}}$ is the total volume of the solution.\n\nThe problem states that the solution is dilute. For a dilute solution, the number of moles of the solute is much smaller than the number of moles of the solvent ($n_{\\text{CO}_2} \\ll n_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$). Also, the volume of the solution is approximately equal to the volume of the solvent ($V_{\\text{solution}} \\approx V_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$).\nApplying these approximations:\n$x_{\\text{CO}_2} \\approx \\frac{n_{\\text{CO}_2}}{n_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}$\n$c_{\\text{CO}_2} \\approx \\frac{n_{\\text{CO}_2}}{V_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}$\n\nNow let's evaluate the ratio $\\frac{c_{\\text{CO}_2}}{x_{\\text{CO}_2}}$:\n$\\frac{c_{\\text{CO}_2}}{x_{\\text{CO}_2}} \\approx \\frac{n_{\\text{CO}_2} / V_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}{n_{\\text{CO}_2} / n_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}{V_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}$\nThis ratio is simply the molar concentration of the pure solvent, water, which we can denote as $c_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$.\n\nSo, the relationship between the constants becomes:\n$K_{H,c} \\approx \\frac{c_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}{K_{H,x}}$\n\nNext, we calculate the molar concentration of water, $c_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$.\n$c_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}{V_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}} = \\frac{\\text{mass}_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}{M_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} \\cdot V_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}{M_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}$\nWe are given $\\rho_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 997 \\text{ kg/m}^3$ and $M_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 18.015 \\text{ g/mol}$. We must ensure the units are consistent. The target unit for concentration is M (mol/L).\nFirst, convert the density to g/L:\n$\\rho_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 997 \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^3} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ g}}{1 \\text{ kg}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ m}^3}{1000 \\text{ L}} = 997 \\text{ g/L}$\nNow, calculate the molar concentration of water:\n$c_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = \\frac{997 \\text{ g/L}}{18.015 \\text{ g/mol}} = 55.34277... \\text{ mol/L}$\n\nThe problem requires $K_{H,c}$ in units of M/atm. This means the pressure $p$ in the equation $c_i = K_{H,c} \\cdot p_i$ must be in atmospheres (atm). Consequently, the constant $K_{H,x}$ in our derived formula must also be expressed in units of atm to ensure consistency.\nWe are given $K_{H,x} = 1.67 \\times 10^3$ bar.
