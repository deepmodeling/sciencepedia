In its ground state, both electrons occupy the $1s$ orbital. This problem concerns the first excited electronic configuration of this atom, where one electron has been promoted from the $1s$ orbital to the next available orbital of lowest energy.\n\nA complete description of the state of the two electrons is given by a set containing two 4-tuples of quantum numbers, {($n_1, l_1, m_{l,1}, m_{s,1}$), ($n_2, l_2, m_{l,2}, m_{s,2}$)}, where the subscripts 1 and 2 label the two electrons. The quantum numbers are the principal quantum number ($n$), the azimuthal quantum number ($l$), the magnetic quantum number ($m_l$), and the spin magnetic quantum number ($m_s$).
