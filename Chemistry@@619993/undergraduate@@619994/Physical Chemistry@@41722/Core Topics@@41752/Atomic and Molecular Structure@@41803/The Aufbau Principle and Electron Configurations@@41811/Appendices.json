This is the ground state electron configuration for the element.\nB. This is an excited state electron configuration, where one electron occupies a higher energy orbital (3p) while a lower energy orbital (3s) remains only partially filled.\nC. This electron configuration is physically impossible because it violates the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\nD. This electron configuration is physically impossible because it violates Hund's Rule of Maximum Multiplicity.\nE. This configuration represents a positively charged ion of the element, not a neutral atom.\n\n", "solution": "First, determine the ground-state electron configuration for an element with atomic number $Z=12$. A neutral atom has $Z$ electrons, so there are $12$ electrons to place. Using the Aufbau principle (filling orbitals in order of increasing energy: $1s$, $2s$, $2p$, $3s$, $3p$, \\dots), the ground-state configuration is\n$$\n1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}.\n$$\nNow compare this with the given configuration $1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{1}\\,3p^{1}$. Count the electrons:\n$$\n2+2+6+1+1=12,\n$$\nso the configuration corresponds to a neutral atom of the element with $Z=12$. Relative orbital energies within the $n=3$ shell satisfy $E(3s)<E(3p)$. Therefore, the presence of an electron in $3p$ while $3s$ is not fully filled indicates that one electron has been promoted from the lower-energy $3s$ to the higher-energy $3p$ orbital. This is characteristic of an excited state, not the ground state, so option A is false.\n\nCheck the Pauli Exclusion Principle: no orbital contains more than two electrons, and there is no requirement violated by having one electron in $3s$ and one in $3p$. Thus there is no Pauli violation, so option C is false.\n\nCheck Hund’s rule within the $3p$ subshell: with only one electron in $3p$, it occupies one of the three degenerate $p$ orbitals singly, which is consistent with Hund’s rule. There is no violation, so option D is false.\n\nFinally, since the total number of electrons equals $Z$, the species is neutral and not an ion, so option E is false.\n\nThe configuration therefore represents an excited state in which one electron occupies the higher-energy $3p$ orbital while the lower-energy $3s$ orbital is only partially filled.
