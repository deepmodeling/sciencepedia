For a two-electron system like the ground state of a helium atom, the wavefunction $\\Psi$ must account for the indistinguishability of the electrons. This is often accomplished using a Slater determinant.\n\nThe electronic configuration of a ground-state helium atom is $1s^2$. The two electrons occupy the same spatial orbital, $\\psi_{1s}$, but have opposite spins. Let's denote the spin-up state by $\\alpha$ and the spin-down state by $\\beta$.
