We will use Slater's rules to quantify the shielding effect on the outermost electron of a potassium atom, providing a tangible link between the abstract idea of effective nuclear charge and the observable high reactivity of alkali metals. This exercise demonstrates how core electrons form an effective shield that dramatically reduces the nuclear pull on the valence electron [@problem_id:2003841].", "problem": "The high reactivity of alkali metals, such as potassium (K), is largely attributed to the low effective nuclear charge experienced by their single valence electron. This effect, known as electron shielding or screening, reduces the attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electron, making it easier to remove. A quantitative estimate of this shielding can be made using a set of empirical guidelines known as Slater's rules.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, use the following version of Slater's rules to determine the screening constant, $S$:\n1.  Write the electron configuration of the atom and group the orbitals as follows: (1s), (2s, 2p), (3s, 3p), (3d), (4s, 4p), (4d), (4f), (5s, 5p), etc.\n2.  For an electron in an ns or np orbital of interest:\n    a. Electrons in any group with a principal quantum number higher than that of the electron of interest contribute 0 to $S$.\n    b. Each of the other electrons in the same (ns, np) group contributes 0.35 to $S$.\n    c. Electrons in the shell with principal quantum number (n-1) contribute 0.85 each to $S$.\n    d. Electrons in shells with principal quantum number (n-2) or lower contribute 1.00 each to $S$.\n\nThe effective nuclear charge is then calculated as $Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - S$, where $Z$ is the actual nuclear charge (the atomic number).\n\nConsider a neutral potassium atom (atomic number $Z=19$). Calculate the fraction of the total nuclear charge that is screened from its outermost valence electron.
