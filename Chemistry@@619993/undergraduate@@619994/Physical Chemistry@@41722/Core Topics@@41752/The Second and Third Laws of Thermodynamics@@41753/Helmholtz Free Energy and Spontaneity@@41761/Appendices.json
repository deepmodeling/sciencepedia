The Helmholtz free energy is defined as $A = U - TS$, where $U$ is the internal energy, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $S$ is the entropy.\n\nTo find the change in Helmholtz free energy, $\\Delta A$, we consider a differential change, $dA$:\n$$dA = dU - TdS - SdT$$\nThe process is isothermal, which means the temperature $T$ is constant, so $dT = 0$. The expression for $dA$ simplifies to:\n$$dA = dU - TdS$$\nFrom the First Law of Thermodynamics, the change in internal energy $dU$ is given by $dU = dq + dw$, where $dq$ is the heat added to the system and $dw$ is the work done on the system. Substituting this into the equation for $dA$:\n$$dA = (dq + dw) - TdS$$\nFor a reversible process, the change in entropy of the system is defined as $dS = \\frac{dq_{rev}}{T}$, which can be rearranged to $dq_{rev} = TdS$. For the reversible process described in the problem, we can substitute $dq = dq_{rev} = TdS$:\n$$dA = (TdS + dw_{rev}) - TdS$$\n$$dA = dw_{rev}$$\nThis important result shows that for any reversible, isothermal process, the change in Helmholtz free energy is equal to the reversible work done on the system. To find the total change $\\Delta A$ for the entire process, we integrate both sides:\n$$\\Delta A = \\int dA = \\int dw_{rev} = w_{rev}$$\nNow, we must calculate the reversible work, $w_{rev}$, for the isothermal compression of an ideal gas. The work done on a gas during a volume change is given by the integral:\n$$w_{rev} = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P_{ext} dV$$\nFor a reversible process, the external pressure $P_{ext}$ is always infinitesimally close to the internal pressure of the gas, $P$. So, $P_{ext} = P$. For an ideal gas, the pressure is given by the ideal gas law, $P = \\frac{nRT}{V}$. Substituting this into the work integral:\n$$w_{rev} = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \\frac{nRT}{V} dV$$\nSince $n$, $R$, and $T$ are constants during the isothermal process, we can take them out of the integral:\n$$w_{rev} = -nRT \\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \\frac{1}{V} dV$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$w_{rev} = -nRT [\\ln(V)]_{V_i}^{V_f} = -nRT (\\ln(V_f) - \\ln(V_i))$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this can be written as:\n$$w_{rev} = -nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that the process is a compression, meaning the final volume is less than the initial volume, $V_f < V_i$. Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{V_f}{V_i}$ is less than 1. The natural logarithm of any positive number less than 1 is negative. So, $\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right) < 0$.\n\nThe sign of the work done is determined by the product of the terms: $n$, $R$, and $T$ are all positive physical quantities.\n$$w_{rev} = (-nRT) \\times (\\text{a negative number})$$\nThus, $w_{rev} > 0$. This is physically consistent, as work must be done on the system to compress it.\n\nSince we established that $\\Delta A = w_{rev}$, it follows that $\\Delta A > 0$.\n\nThe criterion for spontaneity for a process at constant temperature is given by the sign of $\\Delta A$:\n- If $\\Delta A < 0$, the process is spontaneous.\n- If $\\Delta A > 0$, the process is non-spontaneous (it requires work input to occur).\n- If $\\Delta A = 0$, the system is at equilibrium.\n\nSince we found that $\\Delta A > 0$ for the isothermal reversible compression of an ideal gas, the process is non-spontaneous.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that $\\Delta A > 0$ and the process is non-spontaneous.
