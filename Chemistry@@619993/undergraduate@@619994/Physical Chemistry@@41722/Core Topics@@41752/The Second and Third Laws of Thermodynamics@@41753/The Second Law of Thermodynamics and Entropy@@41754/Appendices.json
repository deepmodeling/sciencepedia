The molar heat capacity at constant volume for this monatomic ideal gas is given by $C_{V,m} = \\frac{3}{2}R$, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant. Determine a symbolic expression for the molar entropy change, $\\Delta S_m$, of the gas as it transitions from the initial to the final state. Your final answer should be expressed in terms of $R$, $T_1$, $T_2$, $P_1$, and $P_2$.", "solution": "The change in entropy, $S$, is a state function, meaning its value depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path taken between them. To calculate the change in molar entropy, $\\Delta S_m$, we can devise any convenient reversible path connecting the initial state $(P_1, T_1)$ to the final state $(P_2, T_2)$.\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation combining the first and second laws for a reversible process is $dU = dq_{\\text{rev}} - P dV$. The differential change in entropy is defined as $dS = \\frac{dq_{\\text{rev}}}{T}$.\nSubstituting $dq_{\\text{rev}}$ from the first law into the entropy definition, we get:\n$$dS = \\frac{dU + P dV}{T}$$\nFor one mole of any substance, we can write this in terms of molar quantities:\n$$dS_m = \\frac{dU_m + P dV_m}{T}$$\nThe molar internal energy of an ideal gas is a function of temperature only, so its differential is given by $dU_m = C_{V,m} dT$, where $C_{V,m}$ is the molar heat capacity at constant volume. Substituting this into the equation for $dS_m$:\n$$dS_m = \\frac{C_{V,m} dT}{T} + \\frac{P dV_m}{T}$$\nFor one mole of an ideal gas, the ideal gas law is $PV_m = RT$, which can be rearranged to $\\frac{P}{T} = \\frac{R}{V_m}$.
