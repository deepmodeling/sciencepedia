To do this, they place a 1-gram sample of the propellant into a rigid, sealed, high-pressure vessel known as a bomb calorimeter. The vessel has a fixed internal volume. It is then filled with excess oxygen gas and the mixture is ignited. The combustion reaction is rapid and irreversible. The heat released by this constant-volume (isochoric) process, denoted as $q_V$, is determined by measuring the temperature rise of a surrounding water bath.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that the change in a closed system's internal energy ($U$) is given by $\\Delta U = q + w$, where $q$ is the heat transferred to the system and $w$ is the work done on the system. For processes involving a volume change against a constant external pressure, the work done on the system is $w = -P \\Delta V$.

We will start with the first law of thermodynamics and apply the constraints of the experiment.\n\nStep 1: State the first law of thermodynamics.\nThe first law of thermodynamics for a closed system relates the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, to the heat, $q$, and work, $w$, exchanged with the surroundings:\n$$\n\\Delta U = q + w\n$$\nHere, $q$ is the heat added to the system, and $w$ is the work done on the system.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the work term, $w$.\nThe problem describes an experiment where the only type of work considered is pressure-volume (PV) work. The work done *on* the system is the negative of the work done *by* the system. The work done by the system expanding its volume $V$ against an external pressure $P_{ext}$ is given by $\\int P_{ext} dV$. Therefore, the work done on the system is:\n$$\nw = - \\int P_{ext} dV\n$$\n\nStep 3: Apply the experimental conditions of the bomb calorimeter.\nThe experiment is conducted in a \"rigid, sealed... vessel\" which has a \"fixed internal volume\". This means the process occurs at a constant volume, or isochorically. Mathematically, this implies that the change in volume, $dV$, is zero at every stage of the process.\n$$\ndV = 0\n$$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total work done.\nSince $dV = 0$ throughout the process, the integral for the work done becomes zero:\n$$\nw = - \\int P_{ext} (0) = 0\n$$\nThis means that under constant volume conditions, no pressure-volume work is done on or by the system.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the first law of thermodynamics under these conditions.\nSubstituting $w=0$ into the first law equation ($\\Delta U = q + w$):\n$$\n\\Delta U = q + 0\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta U = q\n$$\n\nStep 6: Interpret the result in the context of the problem.\nThe heat exchanged in a constant-volume process is denoted in the problem as $q_V$. Therefore, we can write our result as:\n$$\n\\Delta U = q_V\n$$\nThis shows that the heat of reaction measured in a bomb calorimeter is exactly equal to the change in the internal energy of the system.\n\nStep 7: Compare the result with the given options.\nThe derived relationship, $\\Delta U = q_V$, directly corresponds to option D.\n\nFor completeness, let's consider why other options are incorrect.\n- Enthalpy is defined as $H = U + PV$. The change in enthalpy is $\\Delta H = \\Delta U + \\Delta(PV) = \\Delta U + P\\Delta V + V\\Delta P$. Under constant volume, $\\Delta V = 0$, so $\\Delta H = \\Delta U + V\\Delta P$. Since $\\Delta U = q_V$, we have $\\Delta H = q_V + V\\Delta P$. For a combustion reaction, the temperature and moles of gas typically change, leading to a significant change in pressure ($\\Delta P \\neq 0$). Thus, $\\Delta H \\neq q_V$. (Note: $\\Delta H$ is equal to the heat exchanged at constant pressure, $q_P$).\n- The Helmholtz ($A=U-TS$) and Gibbs ($G=H-TS$) free energies involve entropy ($S$) and temperature ($T$), and their changes are not generally equal to $q_V$.\n\nTherefore, the only state function whose change is equal to the heat flow at constant volume is the internal energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2011938"}, {"introduction": "Beyond internal energy, other thermodynamic potentials help us understand different processes.
