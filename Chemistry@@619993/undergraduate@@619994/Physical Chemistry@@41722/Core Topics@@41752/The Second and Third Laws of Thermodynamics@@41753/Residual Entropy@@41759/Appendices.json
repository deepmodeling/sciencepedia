This exercise explores how a molecule's ability to 'freeze' into one of several equally energetic orientations within a crystal lattice leads to a non-zero entropy at absolute zero, as dictated by the Boltzmann entropy formula $S = k_{B} \\ln W$. Mastering this simple case of orientational disorder provides the building block for understanding more complex systems where the number of microscopic arrangements, $W$, must be carefully determined [@problem_id:2003068].", "problem": "A hypothetical molecular crystal is formed from a large number of identical tetrahedral molecules of the type XY$_3$Z. The crystal structure is such that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the X-Z bond axis of every molecule is fixed in a specific orientation relative to the crystal lattice. However, due to minimal energetic barriers, each molecule can be 'frozen' into one of three distinct and energetically equivalent rotational positions around its fixed X-Z axis. Assuming this rotational disorder is the sole source of residual entropy in the solid at 0 K, calculate the molar residual entropy of this crystal. Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of the ideal gas constant, $R$.", "solution": "The residual entropy arises from discrete orientational degeneracy at 0 K.

Consider a hypothetical molecule, 1-formyl-2-hydroxycyclopentene, which exists as an equilibrium mixture of its keto and enol forms. At a specific high temperature, the equilibrium ratio of the more stable keto form to the less stable enol form is precisely 9 to 1. A sample of this compound is rapidly cooled to a temperature approaching absolute zero, forming a crystalline solid. During this rapid cooling process, the individual molecules do not have time to reorient or convert, and they become \"frozen\" in their high-temperature tautomeric states. The keto and enol forms are distributed randomly throughout the crystal lattice sites according to this fixed 9:1 population ratio.\n\nCalculate the molar residual entropy of this crystal.

At very low temperatures, the crystal structure is ordered. However, if the crystal is cooled rapidly from a high temperature, the molecular orientations become randomly \"frozen\" in a disordered state.\n\nExperimental observations suggest a strong, short-range repulsive interaction between the bulky, electron-rich azide groups (−N₃). This interaction is so strong that it completely forbids any two adjacent molecules from both being in the `R` state.
