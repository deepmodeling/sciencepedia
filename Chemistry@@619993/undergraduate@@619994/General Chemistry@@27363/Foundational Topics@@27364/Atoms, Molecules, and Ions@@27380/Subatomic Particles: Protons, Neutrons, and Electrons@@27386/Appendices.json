Thomson's apparatus for measuring the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron. The device consists of two parallel metal plates of length $L$. A beam of charged particles is injected horizontally into the space between the plates with an initial velocity $v_0$. A uniform electric field, with magnitude $E$, is applied in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the particles' initial velocity. This field causes the particles to deflect from their straight-line path. The vertical displacement, or deflection, of a particle is measured at the point where it exits the region between the plates. For this problem, you may neglect any effects due to gravity.\n\nFirst, a beam of electrons is passed through the apparatus. Each electron has a charge of $q_e = -e$ and a mass of $m_e$. They are injected with an initial horizontal velocity $v_0$, and their vertical deflection is measured to be $y_e$.\n\nNext, a beam of newly discovered hypothetical particles, called \"techions,\" is tested in the same apparatus. These techions are found to have a mass equal to half the mass of an electron, so $m_T = \\frac{1}{2} m_e$. However, their charge is identical to that of an electron, $q_T = -e$.
