{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The energy required to remove electrons from an atom—its ionization energy—is not constant. Removing the first valence electron has one cost, but removing a second or third electron costs progressively more. This exercise explores how the pattern of successive ionization energies, specifically a large jump in the required energy, provides a clear \"fingerprint\" of an atom's electronic structure. By analyzing this data, you will learn to pinpoint the number of valence electrons and thus identify an element's group in the periodic table, a fundamental skill in predicting chemical behavior.", "problem": "In the development of next-generation ion propulsion systems for spacecraft, engineers are screening candidate main-group elements for use as propellants. An ideal propellant for a specific thruster design must ionize readily to a +1 charge but must resist further ionization to a +2 state to maximize efficiency and minimize erosion of engine components. An unknown main-group element, designated 'X', is analyzed. Its first four successive molar ionization energies (IE) in the gas phase are measured and listed below.\n\n- First Ionization Energy (IE₁): 419 kJ/mol\n- Second Ionization Energy (IE₂): 3052 kJ/mol\n- Third Ionization Energy (IE₃): 4420 kJ/mol\n- Fourth Ionization Energy (IE₄): 5877 kJ/mol\n\nBased on this experimental data, determine the group in the periodic table to which element 'X' most likely belongs.\n\nA. Group 1 (Alkali Metals)\nB. Group 2 (Alkaline Earth Metals)\nC. Group 13\nD. Group 14\nE. Group 15", "solution": "Successive ionization energies increase because removing an electron from a species with a higher positive charge requires more energy due to increased effective nuclear attraction. For a main-group element with $n_{v}$ valence electrons, the first $n_{v}$ ionizations remove valence electrons and are relatively smaller, while a large jump occurs when the next ionization would remove a core electron. Symbolically, the diagnostic pattern is:\n$$\nIE_{1}  IE_{2}  \\dots  IE_{n_{v}} \\ll IE_{n_{v}+1}.\n$$\nFrom the data for element X:\n- $IE_{1} = 419\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$,\n- $IE_{2} = 3052\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$,\n- $IE_{3} = 4420\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$,\n- $IE_{4} = 5877\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$.\nThe dominant jump occurs between $IE_{1}$ and $IE_{2}$, since $IE_{2} \\gg IE_{1}$. This indicates that after removal of one electron, the species reaches a stable closed-shell (noble-gas-like) configuration, and any further ionization would remove a core electron. Therefore, $n_{v} = 1$.\n\nIn the main group, the number of valence electrons for Groups 1, 2, 13, 14, and 15 is $1, 2, 3, 4,$ and $5$, respectively. A large jump after the first ionization corresponds to one valence electron, i.e., Group 1 (alkali metals). This also matches the application requirement: easy formation of a $+1$ ion (small $IE_{1}$) and strong resistance to forming $+2$ (very large $IE_{2}$).\n\nHence, element X most likely belongs to Group 1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1994692"}, {"introduction": "Ion formation requires an input of energy, which can be delivered by a photon of light.
