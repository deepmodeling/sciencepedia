An element in Group 17 (halogens).", "solution": "We are asked to infer the likely position of a pure elemental solid (Element Z) on the periodic table from its observed physical and electrical properties. The key observations are:\n- It is a solid at standard temperature and pressure with a silvery-gray luster.\n- It is brittle (shatters under hammering) rather than malleable.\n- It conducts electricity, but with conductivity significantly lower than typical metals such as copper or aluminum.\n- Its electrical conductivity increases as temperature increases from 300 K to 500 K.\n\nFrom solid-state physics, electrical conductivity is given by\n$$\n\\sigma = n q \\mu,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the charge carrier concentration, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $\\mu$ is the carrier mobility.\n\nFor typical metals (e.g., Group 1 and d-block metals), the carrier concentration $n$ is approximately temperature independent, while the mobility $\\mu$ decreases with temperature due to increased phonon scattering. In simple models, the scattering time $\\tau$ decreases roughly as $\\tau \\propto 1/T$ at sufficiently high temperatures, and since $\\mu \\propto \\tau$, one expects\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dT} < 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{d\\sigma}{dT} < 0.\n$$\nEquivalently, the resistivity is often modeled as $\\rho(T) \\approx \\rho_{0} + \\alpha T$ with $\\alpha>0$, so $\\sigma(T) = 1/\\rho(T)$ decreases with $T$. Thus, metals generally have a negative temperature coefficient of conductivity.\n\nFor intrinsic semiconductors (and many metalloids with semiconducting behavior), the carrier concentration is strongly temperature dependent. The intrinsic carrier concentration is\n$$\nn_{i}(T) \\propto T^{3/2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}}{2 k_{B} T}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $E_{g}$ is the band gap and $k_{B}$ is Boltzmannâ€™s constant. The conductivity in the intrinsic regime is\n$$\n\\sigma(T) \\approx q \\left(\\mu_{n} + \\mu_{p}\\right) n_{i}(T),\n$$\nso, despite mobilities $\\mu_{n}$ and $\\mu_{p}$ typically decreasing with $T$, the exponential increase of $n_{i}(T)$ dominates over the temperature range stated, yielding\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT} > 0.\n$$\nTherefore, the observed positive temperature coefficient of conductivity between 300 K and 500 K is characteristic of semiconductors/metalloids rather than typical metals.\n\nThe mechanical property that Element Z shatters under a hammer indicates brittleness, which is characteristic of materials with directional covalent bonding (e.g., network solids or metalloids), not of metals, which are typically malleable and ductile due to non-directional metallic bonding.\n\nThe silvery-gray luster is consistent with many metalloids (e.g., Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te), which often have a metallic luster despite not being good metals. Their conductivities are lower than those of typical metals but non-negligible, and they often exhibit $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}>0$.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A (Group 1 alkali metals): These are soft, malleable, highly conducting metals with $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}<0$. The brittleness and positive temperature coefficient contradict this.\n- B (d-block transition metals): Also malleable, highly conducting, with $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}<0$. Again inconsistent with brittleness and the observed temperature trend.\n- C (Group 18 noble gases): These are gases at standard conditions (not solids) and are electrical insulators as elements. This contradicts the given solid and conducting behavior.\n- D (p-block along the stair-step line, i.e., metalloids): Typically brittle, silvery-gray luster, moderate conductivity, and $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}>0$ due to semiconducting behavior. This matches all observations.\n- E (Group 17 halogens): As elements, they are nonmetallic (mostly molecular insulators at standard conditions; iodine is a brittle crystalline solid with luster but very poor conductivity). The statement that Element Z is an electrical conductor with conductivity that increases with temperature could superficially resemble a very poor semiconductor; however, the combination of silvery luster, brittle behavior, and appreciable conductivity lower than but comparable in kind to metals is most consistently explained by metalloids rather than halogens.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that Element Z is a metalloid located in the p-block along the diagonal stair-step line separating metals from nonmetals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2003879"}, {"introduction": "The periodic table's true power lies in its predictive capacity; by knowing an element's location, we can forecast its chemical personality.

These correspond to the highest stable oxidation states for gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), and arsenic (As), respectively. To probe their acid-base character, the scientist prepares two separate aqueous test solutions: a strong acid (hydrochloric acid, HCl) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH). The experiment involves adding a small amount of each oxide to separate beakers of the acidic and basic solutions to observe if dissolution occurs. Dissolution in this context is indicative of a chemical reaction between the oxide and the solute (acid or base).\n\nBased on the established periodic trends concerning metallic, metalloid, and non-metallic character, which one of the following statements most accurately predicts the experimental outcomes?\n\nA. $Ga_2O_3$ will dissolve in the acid, $GeO_2$ will remain insoluble in both solutions, and $As_2O_5$ will dissolve in the base.\n\nB.

A general trend exists:\n- Metallic character decreases from left to right across a period.\n- Oxides of metals tend to be basic.\n- Oxides of nonmetals tend to be acidic.\n- Oxides of elements at the borderline between metals and nonmetals (i.e., metalloids) are often amphoteric, meaning they can react as both an acid and a base.\n- For a given element that forms multiple oxides, the acidity of the oxide increases with the oxidation state of the element.\n\nThe problem considers the highest oxidation state oxides for Gallium (Ga), Germanium (Ge), and Arsenic (As), which are all in Period 4.\n\n1.  **Gallium(III) oxide ($Ga_2O_3$)**: Gallium is in Group 13. It is a post-transition metal, located near the metalloid staircase. As such, its oxide, $Ga_2O_3$, is expected to be amphoteric.\n    - As a base, it reacts with strong acids: $Ga_2O_3(s) + 6H^+(aq) \\rightarrow 2Ga^{3+}(aq) + 3H_2O(l)$.\n    - As an acid, it reacts with strong bases: $Ga_2O_3(s) + 2OH^-(aq) + 3H_2O(l) \\rightarrow 2[Ga(OH)_4]^-(aq)$.\n    Therefore, $Ga_2O_3$ will dissolve in both the acidic (HCl) and basic (NaOH) solutions.\n\n2.  **Germanium(IV) oxide ($GeO_2$)**: Germanium is in Group 14 and is classified as a metalloid. It is to the right of Gallium, so it has less metallic character. Its oxide, $GeO_2$, is also expected to be amphoteric, but with a more pronounced acidic character compared to $Ga_2O_3$.\n    - As a base, it reacts with strong acids: $GeO_2(s) + 4H^+(aq) \\rightarrow Ge^{4+}(aq) + 2H_2O(l)$ (or more complex halo-complexes).\n    - As an acid, it reacts with strong bases: $GeO_2(s) + 2OH^-(aq) \\rightarrow GeO_3^{2-}(aq) + H_2O(l)$.\n    Therefore, $GeO_2$ will also dissolve in both the acidic and basic solutions.\n\n3.  **Arsenic(V) oxide ($As_2O_5$)**: Arsenic is in Group 15 and is also a metalloid, but it exhibits significant non-metallic properties. It is to the right of Germanium, continuing the trend of decreasing metallic character. The oxide is in a very high oxidation state (+5), which strongly enhances its acidic nature. Therefore, $As_2O_5$ is an acidic oxide.\n    - As an acid, it will not react with other acids like HCl.\n    - As an acid, it will react readily with strong bases in a neutralization reaction to form arsenate salts: $As_2O_5(s) + 6OH^-(aq) \\rightarrow 2AsO_4^{3-}(aq) + 3H_2O(l)$.\n    Therefore, $As_2O_5$ will dissolve only in the basic (NaOH) solution.\n\nCombining these findings:\n- $Ga_2O_3$: Dissolves in both acid and base.\n- $GeO_2$: Dissolves in both acid and base.\n- $As_2O_5$: Dissolves only in base.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n- A.

The process is highly favorable because the alkali metal's low ionization energy is significantly smaller in magnitude than the halogen's large negative electron affinity, resulting in a net release of energy upon electron transfer between the isolated gaseous atoms.\n\nB. The compound is stable primarily because the formation of gaseous ions from gaseous atoms (the sum of steps 1 and 2) is a strongly exothermic process, which drives the overall reaction.\n\nC. The stability is fundamentally driven by the very large amount of energy released during the formation of the crystal lattice from gaseous ions, which is sufficient to overcome the net energy cost of creating the ions in the first place.\n\nD. The stability arises from the formation of a shared electron pair between the metal and halogen atoms, resulting in a nonpolar covalent bond that minimizes the system's potential energy according to the octet rule.\n\nE. Both the M$^{+}$ and X$^{-}$ ions achieve noble gas electron configurations, and this attainment of a full octet is, by itself, an energetically favorable process that releases enough energy to form the stable compound.", "solution": "We analyze the formation of $MX(s)$ from neutral gaseous atoms via the Bornâ€“Haber cycle.
