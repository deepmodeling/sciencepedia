{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first exercise presents a classic thought experiment involving a sealed photographic flashbulb. It is designed to solidify your understanding of the law of conservation of mass in its most fundamental context: a closed system, where no matter can enter or leave. By analyzing what happens to the total mass as a chemical reaction converts reactants into products inside the sealed container [@problem_id:2001745], you will reinforce the core principle that mass is merely rearranged, not created or destroyed.", "problem": "An old-fashioned photographic flashbulb consists of a sealed glass bulb containing a fine magnesium ($Mg$) filament and filled with pure oxygen ($O_2$) gas. An experimenter carefully measures the total mass of one of these pristine flashbulbs and records it as $m_{initial}$. The bulb is then \"fired\" by passing a small electric current through the filament. This initiates a rapid and highly exothermic reaction, producing a brilliant flash of light and converting all the magnesium and oxygen into a fine, white, solid powder, magnesium oxide ($MgO$). The chemical reaction is described by the equation: $2Mg(s) + O_2(g) \\rightarrow 2MgO(s)$.\n\nAfter the bulb has completely cooled down to its initial ambient temperature, its total mass is measured again and recorded as $m_{final}$. The glass bulb remains sealed and intact throughout the entire process.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the initial mass ($m_{initial}$) and the final mass ($m_{final}$)?\n\nA. $m_{final} > m_{initial}$ because the solid magnesium oxide formed is denser than the original magnesium filament.\n\nB. $m_{final} < m_{initial}$ because a large amount of energy in the form of light and heat is released from the bulb.\n\nC. $m_{final} < m_{initial}$ because a gas (oxygen) is consumed and converted into a solid component.\n\nD. $m_{final} = m_{initial}$ because the flashbulb constitutes a closed system.\n\nE. The relationship cannot be determined without knowing the precise initial masses of the magnesium and oxygen inside the bulb.", "solution": "Let the system be the sealed glass bulb and everything inside it. No matter crosses the boundary during the process, so it is closed with respect to mass exchange. Let $m_{\\text{glass}}$ denote the mass of the glass, $m_{\\text{Mg}}$ the mass of magnesium, $m_{O_{2}}$ the mass of oxygen gas, and $m_{\\text{MgO}}$ the mass of magnesium oxide after reaction.\n\nBefore firing, at the initial ambient temperature,\n$$\nm_{\\text{initial}}=m_{\\text{glass}}+m_{\\text{Mg}}+m_{O_{2}}.\n$$\n\nThe reaction is\n$$\n2\\,\\text{Mg}(s)+O_{2}(g)\\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{MgO}(s).\n$$\nBy conservation of atoms and the additivity of mass for chemical species, each mole of $\\text{MgO}$ contains one Mg atom and one O atom, so the molar masses satisfy\n$$\nM_{\\text{MgO}}=M_{\\text{Mg}}+M_{\\text{O}},\\quad M_{O_{2}}=2M_{\\text{O}},\n$$\nwhich implies for two moles,\n$$\n2M_{\\text{MgO}}=2M_{\\text{Mg}}+M_{O_{2}}.\n$$\nTherefore, for any completely reacted amounts,\n$$\nm_{\\text{MgO}}=m_{\\text{Mg}}+m_{O_{2}}.\n$$\n\nAfter the bulb has reacted and cooled back to the initial ambient temperature, the final total mass is\n$$\nm_{\\text{final}}=m_{\\text{glass}}+m_{\\text{MgO}}=m_{\\text{glass}}+\\left(m_{\\text{Mg}}+m_{O_{2}}\\right)=m_{\\text{initial}}.\n$$\n\nThus $m_{\\text{final}}=m_{\\text{initial}}$. The density change and the phase change of oxygen do not affect total mass, since the matter remains inside the sealed bulb. Although energy is released, in classical conservation of mass (appropriate here) the loss of energy to the surroundings does not change the measured mass of the bulb; a fully relativistic correction would be of order $\\frac{E}{c^{2}}$ and is negligible and not intended in this context. The correct choice is that the masses are equal because the bulb is closed to matter exchange.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2001745"}, {"introduction": "Moving from idealized closed systems, this next problem simulates a common laboratory scenario where a reaction occurs in an open beaker. You will confront an apparent decrease in mass when an effervescent tablet reacts in water, a situation that might seem to contradict the conservation law at first glance. This exercise [@problem_id:2001750] challenges you to apply the law of conservation of mass to an open system, an essential skill for correctly interpreting experimental outcomes where products, such as gases, can escape into the surroundings.", "problem": "A student in a general chemistry lab is tasked with investigating a reaction that produces a gas. The student places an open 400 mL beaker containing 150.0 mL of deionized water onto a digital balance, and the balance reads a mass of 255.45 g. The student then obtains an effervescent tablet, primarily composed of sodium bicarbonate ($NaHCO_3$) and citric acid, and measures its mass to be 3.27 g. The tablet is carefully dropped into the water, initiating a vigorous chemical reaction that produces bubbles. After the bubbling subsides and the reaction is complete, the student notes that the final mass of the beaker and its contents, as displayed on the balance, is 257.06 g. The reaction produces aqueous sodium citrate, water, and carbon dioxide gas. Assuming that only the carbon dioxide gas escaped from the open beaker during the experiment, calculate the mass of carbon dioxide produced by the reaction.\n\nExpress your answer in grams, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Principle: Conservation of mass for an open system with one escaping product (carbon dioxide). Let $m_{i}$ be the initial mass of beaker plus water, $m_{t}$ the tablet mass, $m_{f}$ the final mass on the balance after reaction, and $m_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}$ the mass of carbon dioxide that escaped. Since only carbon dioxide leaves the system,\n$$\nm_{i}+m_{t}=m_{f}+m_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}=m_{i}+m_{t}-m_{f}.\n$$\nSubstituting the measured values $m_{i}=255.45$, $m_{t}=3.27$, and $m_{f}=257.06$ (all in grams),\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}=255.45+3.27-257.06=258.72-257.06=1.66.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the mass of carbon dioxide produced is $1.66$ grams.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.66}$$", "id": "2001750"}, {"introduction": "This final practice demonstrates a powerful analytical application of mass conservation in a technique known as combustion analysis.
