Based on its chemical reactivity patterns inferred from the stellar environment, they classify it as belonging to Group 13 of the periodic table. Further analysis reveals that the element's valence electrons reside in the fifth principal energy level, placing it in Period 5.\n\nFor a neutral atom of this element in its ground electronic state, what is the designation of the orbital that contains its highest-energy electron?\n\nA. 5s\n\nB. 4p\n\nC. 4d\n\nD. 5p\n\nE. 5d", "solution": "The problem asks for the orbital designation of the highest-energy electron for a neutral element located in Group 13 and Period 5.\n\nFirst, we must understand the relationship between an element's position in the periodic table and its electron configuration. The period number corresponds to the principal quantum number, $n$, of the valence shell. The problem states the element is in Period 5, so the principal quantum number for its outermost electrons is $n=5$.\n\nNext, we determine which block of the periodic table the element belongs to. The block is determined by the type of orbital (s, p, d, or f) that holds the highest-energy electrons.\n- Groups 1 and 2 constitute the s-block.\n- Groups 3 through 12 constitute the d-block.\n- Groups 13 through 18 constitute the p-block.\n- The lanthanides and actinides (often shown separately) constitute the f-block.\n\nThe problem states the element is in Group 13. Therefore, it is located in the p-block.\n\nThe designation for the orbital of the highest-energy electron combines the principal quantum number of the period with the letter of the block. In this case, the principal quantum number is $n=5$ and the block is 'p'. This means the highest-energy electron must occupy a $5p$ orbital.\n\nTo verify this, we can trace the filling of orbitals up to this element. The electron configuration for an element in Period 5 would build upon the noble gas configuration of the preceding period, which is Krypton (Kr, Period 4). After Krypton, the orbitals fill in the order dictated by the Aufbau principle:\n1. The 5s orbital is filled (Groups 1 and 2, Period 5). The configuration becomes $[Kr] 5s^2$.\n2. The 4d orbital is filled (the transition metals in Groups 3-12, Period 5). The configuration becomes $[Kr] 5s^2 4d^{10}$. Note that the principal quantum number for the d-block is $n-1$.\n3. The 5p orbital begins to fill (p-block, Period 5). Group 13 is the first group in the p-block, so it will have one electron in the p-orbital. The configuration is $[Kr] 5s^2 4d^{10} 5p^1$.\n\nThe last electron added, which is the electron with the highest energy in the ground state, is the $5p^1$ electron. Thus, the orbital containing this highest-energy electron is a $5p$ orbital.

This final practice demonstrates this by reversing our perspective: instead of using position to predict properties, you will use experimental data—in this case, ionization energies—to deduce an element's number of valence electrons and confirm its group placement. This exercise highlights the powerful link between empirical evidence and the theoretical framework of the periodic table.[@problem_id:2024084]", "problem": "An unknown main-group element, designated 'M', is known to belong to the third period of the periodic table.

The physical principle is that a large jump indicates removal of an electron from a lower, closed shell (a core electron), which occurs only after all valence electrons have been removed. Therefore, the number of valence electrons of $M$ equals the number of electrons removed before this large jump, namely $2$.\n\nBecause $M$ is a third-period main-group element with two valence electrons, its valence configuration is $3s^{2}$ and it belongs to group $2$. The ground-state electron configuration is thus $1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}$. The electrons occupying $p$-orbitals are those in the $2p$ subshell, which contains $2p^{6}$, and there are no $3p$ electrons for this element.
