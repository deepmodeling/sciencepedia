{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "John Dalton's atomic theory was a monumental leap, but it presented a classic chicken-and-egg problem: how can you determine relative atomic masses without knowing chemical formulas, and how can you determine formulas without knowing atomic masses? This thought experiment places you in Dalton's shoes, exploring how a simple (but incorrect) assumption about the formula of water, combined with accurate mass data, leads to a specific, albeit erroneous, conclusion about the relative masses of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. This practice highlights the critical role of assumptions in the scientific process and the iterative nature of developing a theory [@problem_id:1987941].", "problem": "In the early 19th century, John Dalton developed his atomic theory, a cornerstone of modern chemistry. A critical step in his work was determining the relative atomic masses of elements. This required both accurate mass composition data from experiments and correct assumptions about the atomic ratios in compounds.\n\nConsider the analysis of water. It was known with good precision that water is composed of 8 parts oxygen to 1 part hydrogen, by mass. Dalton, in one of his initial hypotheses, incorrectly assumed that the simplest compound between two elements would have a one-to-one atomic ratio. For water, this meant he proposed the chemical formula HO.\n\nBased on the experimentally determined mass composition (8:1, oxygen:hydrogen) and Dalton's incorrect hypothetical formula (HO), what would be the calculated relative atomic mass of an oxygen atom compared to that of a hydrogen atom? Express your answer as a dimensionless numerical value.", "solution": "Let $m_{\\mathrm{O}}$ and $m_{\\mathrm{H}}$ denote the atomic masses of oxygen and hydrogen, respectively. The experimentally determined mass composition of water is $8:1$ (oxygen:hydrogen) by mass. Under Dalton's incorrect hypothesis that water has the formula HO, there is one atom of oxygen for one atom of hydrogen in each formula unit.\n\nFor such a one-to-one atomic ratio, the mass ratio in the compound equals the ratio of the atomic masses:\n$$\n\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{8}{1}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}}} = 8,\n$$\nwhich means the relative atomic mass of oxygen compared to hydrogen would be $8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1987941"}, {"introduction": "The laws of definite and multiple proportions provide a powerful, quantitative method to deduce chemical formulas directly from mass composition data, helping to solve the dilemma presented in the previous problem. This exercise demonstrates how plotting the mass of one element against the mass of another for two different compounds can reveal their underlying atomic structure. By interpreting the slopes of these lines, you will directly apply the logic that connects macroscopic measurements to the integer ratios of atoms in molecules, a cornerstone of Dalton's theory [@problem_id:1987919].", "problem": "A research team is investigating the properties of a binary system composed of a metal, element X, and a nonmetal, element Y. Through a high-temperature synthesis process, they successfully isolate two distinct, pure crystalline compounds, which they label Compound 1 and Compound 2.\n\nTo determine the stoichiometry of these compounds, a series of experiments is conducted. For each compound, multiple pure samples of varying mass are prepared and decomposed into their constituent elements. The mass of element X and the mass of element Y in each sample are precisely measured.\n\nWhen the researchers plot the mass of element Y versus the mass of element X for the data from Compound 1, they find that all data points lie perfectly on a straight line that passes through the origin. The slope of this line is measured to be $S_1 = 1.144$.\n\nA similar analysis for Compound 2 also yields a straight line passing through the origin when the mass of Y is plotted against the mass of X. The slope of this line is found to be $S_2 = 1.716$.\n\nBased on other structural analyses, it is determined that Compound 1 has the simplest possible integer formula, XY.
