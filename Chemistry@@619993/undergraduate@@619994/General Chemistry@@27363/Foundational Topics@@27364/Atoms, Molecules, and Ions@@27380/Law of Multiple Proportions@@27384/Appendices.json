Two distinct, pure compounds containing only chromium (Cr) and chlorine (Cl) are synthesized. In an elemental analysis of the first compound, labeled Compound A, it is found that 2.00 g of chromium has combined with 3.89 g of chlorine. In a separate analysis of the second compound, labeled Compound B, 3.50 g of chromium is found to be combined with 9.08 g of chlorine.

To find this, we must first calculate this mass-per-gram value for each compound.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mass of chlorine that combines with 1.00 g of chromium in Compound A.\nThe data for Compound A shows that 3.89 g of chlorine (Cl) combines with 2.00 g of chromium (Cr). To find the mass of chlorine per gram of chromium, we set up a ratio.\n\nLet $R_A$ be the mass of Cl per gram of Cr in Compound A.\n$$R_A = \\frac{\\text{mass of Cl in Compound A}}{\\text{mass of Cr in Compound A}} = \\frac{3.89 \\text{ g Cl}}{2.00 \\text{ g Cr}}$$\n$$R_A = 1.945 \\frac{\\text{g Cl}}{\\text{g Cr}}$$\n\nSo, in Compound A, 1.945 g of chlorine combines with 1.00 g of chromium.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the mass of chlorine that combines with 1.00 g of chromium in Compound B.\nThe data for Compound B shows that 9.08 g of chlorine (Cl) combines with 3.50 g of chromium (Cr). We perform a similar calculation for Compound B.\n\nLet $R_B$ be the mass of Cl per gram of Cr in Compound B.\n$$R_B = \\frac{\\text{mass of Cl in Compound B}}{\\text{mass of Cr in Compound B}} = \\frac{9.08 \\text{ g Cl}}{3.50 \\text{ g Cr}}$$\n$$R_B \\approx 2.5942857 \\frac{\\text{g Cl}}{\\text{g Cr}}$$\n\nSo, in Compound B, approximately 2.594 g of chlorine combines with 1.00 g of chromium. It is important to keep extra significant figures for this intermediate step to avoid rounding errors in the final calculation.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the final ratio required by the problem.\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the mass of chlorine per gram of chromium in Compound B to that in Compound A. This is the ratio of $R_B$ to $R_A$.\n\n$$\\text{Final Ratio} = \\frac{R_B}{R_A} = \\frac{2.5942857 \\frac{\\text{g Cl}}{\\text{g Cr}}}{1.945 \\frac{\\text{g Cl}}{\\text{g Cr}}}$$\n$$\\text{Final Ratio} \\approx 1.333823$$\nThe units of $\\frac{\\text{g Cl}}{\\text{g Cr}}$ cancel out, leaving a dimensionless ratio, as expected.\n\nStep 4: Round the final answer to the specified number of significant figures.\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to three significant figures.\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 1.333823.\nRounding this to three significant figures gives 1.33.\n\nThis result demonstrates the Law of Multiple Proportions. The ratio of 1.33 is the decimal representation of the simple whole-number fraction $\\frac{4}{3}$, meaning that for a fixed amount of chromium, the mass of chlorine in Compound B is $\\frac{4}{3}$ times the mass of chlorine in Compound A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.33}$$", "id": "2002024"}, {"introduction": "In modern chemical analysis, we often work with instrumental signals rather than direct mass measurements.
