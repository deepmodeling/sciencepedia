The following practice [@problem_id:2009744] is designed to build your proficiency in applying the standard hierarchical rules for assigning oxidation numbers, paying special attention to common exceptions like hydrogen in metal hydrides.", "problem": "In computational chemistry, simplified models are often used to assign hypothetical charges to atoms within a molecule. One such model defines a \"Formal Atomic Charge Index\" (FACI) for each atom. The FACI is a hypothetical charge assigned to an atom in a molecule by treating all bonds as if they were 100% ionic. This index is determined using a set of hierarchical rules, where a rule with a lower number takes precedence over a rule with a higher number in case of a conflict.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n1.  The FACI of an atom in its elemental form (e.g., $O_2$, $Fe$) is 0.\n2.  For a monoatomic ion, the FACI is equal to the charge of the ion (e.g., for $Na^{+}$, the FACI is +1).\n3.  The sum of the FACIs of all atoms in a neutral molecule is 0. The sum for a polyatomic ion equals the overall charge of the ion.\n4.  In its compounds, fluorine (F) is always assigned a FACI of -1.\n5.  In their compounds, alkali metals (Group 1) are assigned a FACI of +1, and alkaline earth metals (Group 2) are assigned a FACI of +2.\n6.  In the vast majority of its compounds, hydrogen (H) is assigned a FACI of +1.\n7.  In most of its compounds, oxygen (O) is assigned a FACI of -2.\n\nConsider a set of simple binary hydrides: methane ($CH_4$), ammonia ($NH_3$), water ($H_2O$), and calcium hydride ($CaH_2$).

We apply the hierarchical rules given.\n\nFor methane $CH_{4}$: By rule 6, hydrogen is assigned FACI $+1$ in the vast majority of its compounds. There are 4 hydrogen atoms, so the total contribution from hydrogen is\n$$4 \\times (+1) = +4.$$\n\nFor ammonia $NH_{3}$: By rule 6, each hydrogen has FACI $+1$. With 3 hydrogen atoms, the total is\n$$3 \\times (+1) = +3.$$\n\nFor water $H_{2}O$: Using rule 6, each hydrogen has FACI $+1$, so with 2 hydrogens the total is\n$$2 \\times (+1) = +2.$$\nThis is consistent with rule 7 assigning oxygen a FACI of $-2$ and rule 3 requiring the sum in a neutral molecule to be zero, since\n$$2x + (-2) = 0 \\implies x = +1.$$\n\nFor calcium hydride $CaH_{2}$: By rule 5, calcium (an alkaline earth metal) is assigned FACI $+2$. Let the FACI of hydrogen in this compound be $x$. By rule 3 (sum to zero in a neutral compound),\n$$+2 + 2x = 0 \\implies x = -1.$$\nThus the total contribution from the two hydrogens is\n$$2 \\times (-1) = -2.$$\n\nSumming the hydrogen contributions across the four molecules gives\n$$S = 4(+1) + 3(+1) + 2(+1) + 2(-1) = 4 + 3 + 2 - 2 = 7.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "2009744"}, {"introduction": "After identifying the oxidized and reduced species, the next critical skill is to write a balanced chemical equation that accurately represents the reaction.
