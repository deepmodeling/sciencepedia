The key lies in the number of mobile ions a substance produces. This first practice challenges you to compare the electrical conductivity of solutions with the same molar concentration, forcing you to look closely at the chemical formula of each solute and predict how it will behave in waterâ€”whether it will produce no ions, a few ions, or many ions per formula unit [@problem_id:1991008]. This exercise is fundamental for linking the molecular identity of a substance to the macroscopic properties of its solution.", "problem": "An essential property of aqueous solutions is their ability to conduct electricity, which depends on the presence and concentration of dissolved ions. Consider three separate aqueous solutions, each prepared with an identical molar concentration of 0.1 M. The solutes used are glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$), magnesium chloride ($MgCl_2$), and sodium nitrate ($NaNO_3$).\n\nAssuming ideal behavior and complete dissociation for any strong electrolytes, arrange these three solutions in order of increasing electrical conductivity.

Sodium Nitrate < Magnesium Chloride < Glucose\n\nD. Glucose < Magnesium Chloride < Sodium Nitrate\n\nE. Sodium Nitrate < Glucose < Magnesium Chloride", "solution": "The electrical conductivity of an aqueous solution is directly related to the total concentration of mobile ions in the solution. To determine the order of conductivity for the three given solutions, we must analyze how each solute behaves when dissolved in water. All solutions have the same initial molar concentration of 0.1 M.\n\n1.  **Glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$):**\n    Glucose is a molecular compound. When it dissolves in water, the glucose molecules disperse throughout the solvent, but they do not break apart into ions. This process can be represented as:\n    $$C_6H_{12}O_6(s) \\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6(aq)$$\n    Since no ions are produced, glucose is classified as a nonelectrolyte. The resulting solution contains almost no mobile ions (except for the very few from the autoionization of water), and therefore, it will have the lowest electrical conductivity of the three.\n\n2.  **Sodium Nitrate ($NaNO_3$):**\n    Sodium nitrate is an ionic compound composed of the sodium cation ($Na^+$) and the nitrate anion ($NO_3^-$). As a soluble salt, it is a strong electrolyte, meaning it dissociates completely into its constituent ions when dissolved in water:\n    $$NaNO_3(s) \\rightarrow Na^+(aq) + NO_3^-(aq)$$\n    For each mole of $NaNO_3$ that dissolves, it produces two moles of ions: one mole of $Na^+$ and one mole of $NO_3^-$. Therefore, a 0.1 M solution of $NaNO_3$ will have a total ion concentration of:\n    $$ \\text{Total ion concentration} = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times (1 \\text{ ion } Na^+ + 1 \\text{ ion } NO_3^-) = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times 2 = 0.2 \\, \\text{M}$$\n\n3.  **Magnesium Chloride ($MgCl_2$):**\n    Magnesium chloride is also an ionic compound and a strong electrolyte. It dissociates completely in water to form a magnesium cation ($Mg^{2+}$) and two chloride anions ($Cl^-$):\n    $$MgCl_2(s) \\rightarrow Mg^{2+}(aq) + 2Cl^-(aq)$$\n    For each mole of $MgCl_2$ that dissolves, it produces three moles of ions: one mole of $Mg^{2+}$ and two moles of $Cl^-$. Therefore, a 0.1 M solution of $MgCl_2$ will have a total ion concentration of:\n    $$ \\text{Total ion concentration} = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times (1 \\text{ ion } Mg^{2+} + 2 \\text{ ions } Cl^-) = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times 3 = 0.3 \\, \\text{M}$$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy comparing the total concentration of ions in each 0.1 M solution, we have:\n-   Glucose: Negligible ion concentration ($\\approx 0$ M)\n-   Sodium Nitrate: Total ion concentration = 0.2 M\n-   Magnesium Chloride: Total ion concentration = 0.3 M\n\nSince electrical conductivity is proportional to the total ion concentration, the order of increasing conductivity is the same as the order of increasing total ion concentration:\nGlucose < Sodium Nitrate < Magnesium Chloride\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1991008"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative comparison to quantitative analysis is a crucial step in chemistry. This next problem takes you through the process of calculating the precise total concentration of ions in a solution prepared from a known mass of a strong electrolyte.
