The boron mass fraction $f_{B}$ is given by the elemental analysis, and the molecular molar mass $M$ is given by mass spectrometry.\n\nBy definition of mass fraction,\n$$\nf_{B}=\\frac{m_{B}x}{m_{B}x+m_{Cl}y}.\n$$\nSolve for the stoichiometric ratio $x/y$:\n$$\nm_{B}x=f_{B}\\left(m_{B}x+m_{Cl}y\\right)\\;\\Rightarrow\\;(1-f_{B})m_{B}x=f_{B}m_{Cl}y\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{f_{B}m_{Cl}}{(1-f_{B})m_{B}}.\n$$\nSubstitute the given numerical values $f_{B}=0.07083$, $m_{B}=10.81$, and $m_{Cl}=35.45$:\n$$\n\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{0.07083\\times 35.45}{(1-0.07083)\\times 10.81}\\approx\\frac{2.5109235}{10.0443337}\\approx 0.25=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThus the empirical formula ratio is $x:y=1:4$, i.e., the empirical formula is $BCl_{4}$.

This practice explores a fascinating and important limitation of the standard naming system through the concept of structural isomers—molecules that share the same formula but have different atomic arrangements. By examining a case [@problem_id:2007615] where one formula, $S_2F_2$, corresponds to two distinct compounds, you will learn why simple stoichiometric names are sometimes insufficient and gain insight into the relationship between composition, structure, and chemical identity.", "problem": "In inorganic chemistry, the molecular formula $S_2F_2$ is known to represent at least two distinct, stable compounds that are structural isomers. One isomer, disulfur difluoride, has a connectivity of F-S-S-F. The other isomer, thiothionyl fluoride, has a structure where both fluorine atoms are bonded to the same sulfur atom, which is then double-bonded to the second sulfur atom (S=SF$_2$).\n\nAccording to the standard rules for naming simple binary molecular compounds, only one systematic name can be assigned based on the molecular formula. Which of the following options correctly provides this single systematic name for the formula $S_2F_2$ and accurately identifies the fundamental limitation of this naming convention that makes it incapable of distinguishing between the two isomers?\n\nA. Name: Sulfur(I) fluoride. Limitation: The use of Roman numerals (Stock system) for nonmetals is not defined, leading to ambiguity.\n\nB. Name: Disulfur difluoride. Limitation: The rules for assigning prefixes become ambiguous when an element, like sulfur, can exhibit multiple oxidation states.\n\nC. Name: Thiothionyl fluoride. Limitation: Common names are preferred over systematic names when isomerism is possible.\n\nD. Name: Disulfur difluoride. Limitation: The system is based on elemental composition (stoichiometry) and does not encode information about atomic connectivity (structure).\n\nE. Name: Disulfur fluoride. Limitation: Prefixes are omitted for the second element if its subscript is the same as the first element's subscript.", "solution": "- Identify the applicable naming convention. For simple binary molecular compounds comprising two nonmetals, the standard systematic naming uses stoichiometric prefixes (mono-, di-, tri-, etc.), orders the elements by increasing electronegativity (less electronegative named first), and converts the second element’s name to its -ide form.\n\n- Apply the rules to $S_{2}F_{2}$. Between sulfur and fluorine, sulfur is less electronegative, so sulfur is named first. The subscripts are $2$ for sulfur and $2$ for fluorine, so the prefixes are “di-” for both elements. The second element takes the -ide form “fluoride.” Thus, the single systematic name derivable purely from the formula $S_{2}F_{2}$ is “disulfur difluoride.”\n\n- Analyze the limitation relative to the two isomers. The two isomers, disulfur difluoride (connectivity F–S–S–F) and thiothionyl fluoride (connectivity S=SF$_{2}$), have identical elemental composition (same stoichiometry) but different atomic connectivity (structure). The stoichiometric-prefix system encodes only the count of each element and not how atoms are connected. Therefore, it cannot distinguish structural isomers that share the same $S_{2}F_{2}$ formula.\n\n- Map to the options:\n  - A is incorrect: “Sulfur(I) fluoride” does not follow the prefix system for $S_{2}F_{2}$ and the stated limitation about Roman numerals is not the fundamental issue here.\n  - B is incorrect: The prefix rules themselves are not ambiguous due to multiple oxidation states; they simply count atoms.\n  - C is incorrect: “Thiothionyl fluoride” is a specific isomeric name, not the single systematic stoichiometric name derivable from the formula alone, and the stated limitation about preferring common names is irrelevant.\n  - D is correct: The appropriate name is “disulfur difluoride,” and the limitation is that the system is composition-based and does not encode connectivity.\n  - E is incorrect: The rule stated about omitting prefixes when subscripts match is not part of the system; both “di-” prefixes are required.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2007615"}]}
