The Stock system solves this by using Roman numerals to specify the metal's oxidation state based on the charge of the anion it is paired with. This practice [@problem_id:2008298], involving a simple oxide of nickel that is essential in battery technology, provides a fundamental exercise in applying this crucial naming convention.", "problem": "In the manufacturing process of rechargeable Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries, a compound with the chemical formula $NiO$ serves as a critical material for the positive electrode (cathode).

Mononickel monoxide", "solution": "We consider the binary compound with formula $NiO$. In oxides, the oxidation state of oxygen is taken as $-2$ in the absence of peroxides or superoxides. Let the oxidation state of nickel be $x$. The sum of oxidation states in a neutral compound is zero, so we write\n$$\nx + (-2) = 0 \\implies x = +2.\n$$\nBy the Stock system of nomenclature for transition metal compounds, the systematic name is given by the metal name followed by its oxidation state in Roman numerals in parentheses, then the anion name. Therefore, $NiO$ is named nickel(II) oxide.\n\nWe check the options:\n- A. Nickel oxide: This omits the oxidation state and is not systematic for a metal with multiple common oxidation states.\n- B. Nickel(I) oxide: This would correspond to $Ni_{2}O$, not $NiO$.\n- C. Nickel(II) oxide: This matches $x=+2$ and is the correct systematic Stock name.\n- D. Nickel monoxide: This is a stoichiometric name using prefixes but is not the preferred systematic name for a transition metal oxide with variable oxidation states.\n- E.
