When presented with the chemical formula $HClO_3$, the student identifies it as \"hydrochloric acid\". While this name does correspond to a common acid, it is incorrect for the given formula. The student's error stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of one of the key rules of inorganic nomenclature. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary error in the student's naming convention?\n\nA. The \"hydro-\" prefix should only be used for binary acids, which do not contain oxygen.\n\nB. The suffix should be \"-ous\" instead of \"-ic\" because the acid contains chlorine.\n\nC. The prefix \"per-\" should have been added because the acid is a strong electrolyte.\n\nD. The name \"hydrochloric acid\" is correct, but it only applies when $HClO_3$ is dissolved in water.\n\nE. The name of an acid should be based on the hydrogen cation, so it should be named \"hydrogen chlorate\".", "solution": "To determine the correct name for $HClO_3$ and diagnose the student's error, apply the standard rules of inorganic acid nomenclature:\n\n1. Distinguish between binary acids and oxyacids.\n   - Binary acids consist of hydrogen and a single nonmetal with no oxygen, typically of the form $HX$. When dissolved in water, they are named with the prefix \"hydro-\", the root of the nonmetal, and the suffix \"-ic acid\". For example, $HCl(aq)$ is named \"hydrochloric acid\".\n   - Oxyacids contain hydrogen, a nonmetal, and oxygen. Their names are derived from the corresponding oxoanions: anions ending in \"-ate\" give acids ending in \"-ic\", and anions ending in \"-ite\" give acids ending in \"-ous\". The \"hydro-\" prefix is not used for oxyacids.\n\n2. Identify the relevant oxoanion for $HClO_3$.\n   - The anion $ClO_3^{-}$ is named \"chlorate\". Therefore, the acid $HClO_3$, which corresponds to chlorate, is named \"chloric acid\" by replacing \"-ate\" with \"-ic\".\n\n3. Contrast with the student's answer and evaluate the options.\n   - The student's name \"hydrochloric acid\" corresponds to $HCl(aq)$, a binary acid, not to $HClO_3$, an oxyacid. The error is the misuse of the \"hydro-\" prefix for an oxyacid.\n   - Option A correctly states that the \"hydro-\" prefix should only be used for binary acids, which do not contain oxygen.\n   - Option B is incorrect because the \"-ous\" suffix applies to the \"-ite\" oxoanion (e.g., $HClO_2$ is chlorous acid), not merely due to the presence of chlorine.\n   - Option C is incorrect because the \"per-\" prefix refers to the oxyacid with the highest oxygen content in a series (e.g., $HClO_4$ is perchloric acid), not to electrolyte strength.\n   - Option D is incorrect because \"hydrochloric acid\" refers specifically to $HCl(aq)$, not $HClO_3$.\n   - Option E is incorrect because acid naming is based on the associated anion, not by naming the hydrogen cation explicitly; \"hydrogen chlorate\" is not the acid name.\n\nTherefore, the primary error is the misuse of the \"hydro-\" prefix for an oxyacid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2007295"}, {"introduction": "Once you can distinguish binary acids from oxyacids, the next step is to master the systematic naming within the oxyacid family itself.

By untangling this ambiguity, you will synthesize your knowledge of both binary and oxyacid nomenclature, cementing why the strict separation of their naming rules is so critical.", "problem": "In a university stockroom, a lab technician discovers an old bottle with a faded, handwritten label that appears to read \"hydrophosphoric acid\".

This is the pattern in names such as hydrochloric acid for $HCl$ and hydrosulfuric acid for $H_2S$. Applying this rule to phosphorus (root \"phosph-\") with the phosphide anion $P^{3-}$ gives the binary acid $H_3P$, whose traditional aqueous name would be \"hydrophosphoric acid.\" Thus one interpretation, following the correct binary-acid rule, is $H_3P$.\n\nSecond, for oxyacids of phosphorus, the \"-ic\" ending denotes the higher oxidation state acid, namely phosphoric acid, which is $H_3PO_4$, while \"-ous\" denotes the lower oxidation state acid, phosphorous acid, $H_3PO_3$. The prefix \"hydro-\" is not used for oxyacids; adding \"hydro-\" to an oxyacid name is a common naming error. Therefore, a common misinterpretation of \"hydrophosphoric acid\" would be an erroneous way of referring to phosphoric acid $H_3PO_4$.\n\nHence, the two possible formulas suggested by the ambiguous name are $H_3P$ (correct binary-acid interpretation) and $H_3PO_4$ (common erroneous oxyacid interpretation), which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2007310"}]}
