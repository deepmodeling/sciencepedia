The precision cannot be meaningfully compared without knowing the standard deviation of multiple measurements with each pipette.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to compare the precision of two volumetric pipettes by calculating their percent relative uncertainties. Precision in this context is inversely related to relative uncertainty; a smaller relative uncertainty implies higher precision.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between absolute uncertainty, relative uncertainty, and the measured quantity is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Relative Uncertainty} = \\frac{\\text{Absolute Uncertainty}}{\\text{Magnitude of Measurement}}\n$$\nThe percent relative uncertainty is simply the relative uncertainty multiplied by 100%.\n\nLet's analyze the 10-mL pipette first.\nThe nominal volume (magnitude of measurement) is $V_1 = 10.00$ mL.\nThe absolute uncertainty (tolerance) is given as $e_{a,1} = 0.020$ mL.\nThe relative uncertainty for the 10-mL pipette, $e_{r,1}$, is:\n$$\ne_{r,1} = \\frac{e_{a,1}}{V_1} = \\frac{0.020 \\text{ mL}}{10.00 \\text{ mL}} = 0.0020\n$$\nThe percent relative uncertainty for the 10-mL pipette, $\\%e_{r,1}$, is:\n$$\n\\%e_{r,1} = e_{r,1} \\times 100\\% = 0.0020 \\times 100\\% = 0.20\\%\n$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the 25-mL pipette.\nThe nominal volume (magnitude of measurement) is $V_2 = 25.00$ mL.\nThe absolute uncertainty (tolerance) is given as $e_{a,2} = 0.030$ mL.\nThe relative uncertainty for the 25-mL pipette, $e_{r,2}$, is:\n$$\ne_{r,2} = \\frac{e_{a,2}}{V_2} = \\frac{0.030 \\text{ mL}}{25.00 \\text{ mL}} = 0.0012\n$$\nThe percent relative uncertainty for the 25-mL pipette, $\\%e_{r,2}$, is:\n$$\n\\%e_{r,2} = e_{r,2} \\times 100\\% = 0.0012 \\times 100\\% = 0.12\\%\n$$\n\nNow we compare the two pipettes. The 10-mL pipette has a percent relative uncertainty of $0.20\\%$, and the 25-mL pipette has a percent relative uncertainty of $0.12\\%$.\nSince $0.12\\%  0.20\\%$, the 25-mL pipette has a smaller percent relative uncertainty. A smaller relative uncertainty corresponds to higher relative precision. Therefore, the 25-mL pipette is more precise for delivering its nominal volume.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The 10-mL pipette is more precise because its absolute uncertainty is smaller. This is incorrect. While the 10-mL pipette does have a smaller absolute uncertainty ($0.020$ mL vs $0.030$ mL), precision is best-assessed by relative uncertainty, not absolute uncertainty. A smaller absolute uncertainty does not guarantee higher relative precision.\nB. The 25-mL pipette is more precise because its percent relative uncertainty is smaller. This is correct. As calculated, the 25-mL pipette has a percent relative uncertainty of $0.12\\%$, which is smaller than the $0.20\\%$ of the 10-mL pipette.\nC. The 10-mL pipette is more precise because its percent relative uncertainty is smaller. This is incorrect. Our calculation shows the 10-mL pipette has a larger percent relative uncertainty.\nD. Both pipettes have the same relative precision because they are both Class A. This is incorrect. \"Class A\" is a quality standard that sets maximum tolerance limits, but pipettes of different volumes within the same class do not necessarily have the same relative precision.\nE. The precision cannot be meaningfully compared without knowing the standard deviation of multiple measurements with each pipette. This is incorrect. The tolerance provided by the manufacturer represents the systematic uncertainty of the instrument.
