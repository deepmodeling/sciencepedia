The student assembles a filtration apparatus using a Büchner funnel fitted with a rubber adapter, which is placed into the opening of a standard 500 mL thin-walled, flat-bottomed Erlenmeyer flask. A vacuum hose is connected from a laboratory vacuum line to a glass tube inserted through a one-hole rubber stopper, which is then used to seal the Erlenmeyer flask. The student turns on the vacuum source, causing a significant pressure difference between the interior of the flask and the surrounding laboratory, which is at standard atmospheric pressure.\n\nFrom the options below, identify the most significant and immediate physical hazard directly associated with this specific, incorrect choice of glassware for the receiving flask.\n\nA. The solvent will permeate through the molecular structure of the thin glass walls under the established pressure gradient, leading to the release of volatile organic compounds into the laboratory atmosphere.\n\nB. The flask will experience critical thermal shock and crack, as the rapid evaporation of the filtrate under vacuum causes a localized, sudden drop in the temperature of the glass.\n\nC. The flask is at high risk of catastrophic failure via implosion, where the cumulative force exerted by the external atmospheric pressure on the flask's surface, particularly the flat bottom, exceeds the structural integrity of the thin glass.\n\nD. The strong vacuum will pull the fine solid precipitate particles through the pores of the filter paper, leading to significant product loss into the filtrate but posing no direct physical danger to the operator.\n\nE. The rubber stopper sealing the flask will be compressed and forced so deeply into the neck of the flask that it becomes permanently wedged, making it impossible to retrieve the filtrate without breaking the glassware.", "solution": "The apparatus as described uses a standard thin-walled, flat-bottomed Erlenmeyer flask sealed with a stopper and subjected to vacuum. The essential physical principle is that a pressure differential between the exterior laboratory atmosphere and the interior of the flask induces a net compressive load on the flask walls and bottom.\n\nLet the interior pressure be $P_{\\text{in}}$ and the laboratory pressure be $P_{\\text{atm}}$. The net pressure difference is\n$$\n\\Delta P = P_{\\text{atm}} - P_{\\text{in}}.\n$$\nThis pressure acts over each surface area element.

The critical external pressure for a clamped, thin circular plate scales as\n$$\np_{\\text{cr}} \\propto \\frac{E t^{3}}{a^{4} (1 - \\nu^{2})},\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the elastic modulus of glass, $t$ is the plate thickness, and $\\nu$ is Poisson’s ratio. Because $p_{\\text{cr}}$ scales as $t^{3}$, a thin plate (small $t$) has a very small $p_{\\text{cr}}$. Applying vacuum makes $\\Delta P$ approach $P_{\\text{atm}}$, so the condition $\\Delta P > p_{\\text{cr}}$ is readily met for thin-walled, flat-bottomed flasks, causing catastrophic failure by implosion.\n\nThick-walled filter flasks with curved geometries and sidearms are designed to withstand such external pressure; a standard thin-walled Erlenmeyer is not. Therefore, the most significant and immediate physical hazard directly associated with this incorrect glassware choice is implosion under external atmospheric pressure, especially at the flat bottom where bending stresses concentrate.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because typical laboratory glass does not permit meaningful solvent permeation driven by this pressure gradient on the experiment’s timescale.\n- B is not the primary or immediate hazard; while evaporative cooling occurs, thermal shock is not the dominant failure mode here.\n- C correctly identifies implosion due to external pressure exceeding the structural capacity of thin, flat glass.\n- D concerns product loss rather than an operator safety hazard and is not specifically tied to the incorrect receiving flask choice.\n- E is a nuisance rather than a primary safety hazard.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2001444"}, {"introduction": "A reaction that is safe on a small, exploratory scale can become dangerously unpredictable when scaled up. This practice problem moves beyond simple observation to quantitative prediction, examining the critical relationship between heat generation and heat dissipation. You will use a simplified model to discover how the changing surface-area-to-volume ratio can turn a mildly exothermic process into a hazardous thermal runaway, a fundamental principle in chemical process safety. [@problem_id:2001440]", "problem": "A research chemist develops a new synthetic procedure that is mildly exothermic. In a preliminary experiment, a small mass $m_0$ of the reactant mixture is prepared. The reaction is conducted in a spherical glass flask, and under steady-state conditions (where the rate of heat generation by the reaction equals the rate of heat loss to the surroundings), the temperature of the mixture stabilizes at a value $\\Delta T_0$ above the ambient laboratory temperature.\n\nThe chemist now plans to scale up the synthesis by a factor of 100, preparing a mass of $100 m_0$. The reaction will be performed in a larger, geometrically similar spherical flask. To assess the potential thermal hazard of this scale-up, you are asked to predict the new steady-state temperature increase.\n\nAssume the following:\n1.  The reaction mixture has a constant density $\\rho$, so the volume of the mixture is proportional to its mass.\n2.  The rate of heat generated by the reaction is uniform throughout the mixture's volume and is directly proportional to the total mass of the reactants.\n3.  The rate of heat lost to the environment is governed by Newton's law of cooling, meaning it is proportional to the total surface area of the flask and the temperature difference between the flask and the ambient surroundings.\n4.  The heat transfer coefficient and all other physical properties of the mixture are independent of the scale of the reaction.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the new steady-state temperature increase, $\\Delta T_{new}$, to the initial temperature increase, $\\Delta T_0$.

Rate of Heat Generation ($P_{gen}$):**\nThe problem states that the rate of heat generated is directly proportional to the total mass ($m$) of the reactants. Since the density $\\rho$ is constant, the mass is proportional to the volume $V$ ($m = \\rho V$). Therefore, the rate of heat generation is also proportional to the volume of the reaction mixture.\nWe can write this as:\n$$P_{gen} = k_{gen} V$$\nwhere $k_{gen}$ is a constant representing the volumetric rate of heat generation. This constant depends on the reaction chemistry but not on the scale.\n\n**2. Rate of Heat Loss ($P_{loss}$):**\nThe problem states that the heat loss follows Newton's law of cooling. This means the rate of heat loss is proportional to the surface area $A$ of the flask and the temperature difference $\\Delta T$ between the mixture and the ambient surroundings.\nWe can write this as:\n$$P_{loss} = h A \\Delta T$$\nwhere $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, which is assumed to be constant.\n\n**3. Steady-State Condition:**\nEquating the two rates:\n$$k_{gen} V = h A \\Delta T$$\n\nWe can solve for the steady-state temperature increase, $\\Delta T$:\n$$\\Delta T = \\left(\\frac{k_{gen}}{h}\\right) \\frac{V}{A}$$\nSince $k_{gen}$ and $h$ are constants, this equation shows that the steady-state temperature increase is directly proportional to the volume-to-surface-area ratio of the reaction vessel.\n$$\\Delta T \\propto \\frac{V}{A}$$\n\n**4. Geometric Analysis of the Spherical Flask:**\nThe reaction is carried out in a spherical flask of radius $r$.\nThe volume of a sphere is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\nThe surface area of a sphere is $A = 4\\pi r^2$.\n\nThe volume-to-surface-area ratio is:\n$$\\frac{V}{A} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{4\\pi r^2} = \\frac{r}{3}$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $\\Delta T$:\n$$\\Delta T \\propto \\frac{r}{3}$$\nThis demonstrates that for a spherical vessel, the steady-state temperature increase is directly proportional to the radius of the sphere, $\\Delta T \\propto r$.\n\n**5. Scaling Analysis:**\nNow let's compare the initial and new scales.\nThe initial reaction has mass $m_0$, volume $V_0$, and is in a flask of radius $r_0$.\nThe new reaction has mass $m_{new} = 100 m_0$.\nSince volume is proportional to mass ($V = m/\\rho$), the new volume is $V_{new} = 100 V_0$.\n\nWe can relate the volumes to the radii of the spherical flasks:\n$$V_0 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_0^3$$\n$$V_{new} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{new}^3$$\n\nSubstituting the relationship between the volumes:\n$$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{new}^3 = 100 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_0^3\\right)$$\n$$r_{new}^3 = 100 r_0^3$$\n$$r_{new} = (100)^{1/3} r_0$$\n\n**6. Calculating the Ratio of Temperature Increases:**\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta T_{new}}{\\Delta T_0}$.\nUsing the proportionality $\\Delta T \\propto r$, we can write:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta T_{new}}{\\Delta T_0} = \\frac{r_{new}}{r_0}$$\nSubstituting the relationship we found for the radii:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta T_{new}}{\\Delta T_0} = \\frac{(100)^{1/3} r_0}{r_0} = (100)^{1/3}$$\n\n**7. Final Numerical Calculation:**\nNow we compute the numerical value and round it to three significant figures.\n$$(100)^{1/3} \\approx 4.6415888...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get 4.64.\n\nThus, a 100-fold increase in the reaction scale leads to a predicted 4.64-fold increase in the steady-state temperature rise, highlighting a significant thermal hazard due to the less efficient heat dissipation of larger volumes (as the surface-area-to-volume ratio decreases).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.64}$$", "id": "2001440"}, {"introduction": "The most complex hazards often arise not from a single mistake, but from a chain of seemingly correct actions.

[@problem_id:2001456]", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is tasked with preparing a large quantity of anhydrous ethyl acetate for a moisture-sensitive Grignard reaction. The starting material is a bulk container of technical-grade ethyl acetate, which is known to contain small amounts of water and ethanol as impurities. The researcher recalls that sodium metal is an excellent drying agent for ethers and proposes the following purification procedure:\n\n1.  Add several small pieces of sodium metal to the bulk ethyl acetate.\n2.  Allow the mixture to stir overnight at room temperature.\n3.  Filter the solution to remove any unreacted sodium metal and solid byproducts.\n4.  Concentrate the filtered ethyl acetate solution using a rotary evaporator with a water bath set to 50 °C to rapidly remove about 90% of the solvent.\n5.  Perform a final fractional distillation on the concentrated residue to obtain the ultra-pure, anhydrous ethyl acetate.\n\nA senior lab member reviews the plan and immediately stops the researcher, stating that Step 4 presents a severe and acute chemical hazard that has historically led to laboratory explosions. According to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS), ethyl acetate is not known to form explosive peroxides and is thermally stable under these conditions. Assuming the initial reaction of sodium with trace water and ethanol (Step 1) is managed safely, which of the following statements best describes the most significant and probable chemical hazard associated specifically with the rotary evaporation step (Step 4) of this proposed procedure?\n\nA. Residual sodium metal, carried over after filtration, will react explosively with the concentrated ethyl acetate solution as the temperature increases, causing rapid thermal decomposition of the ester into flammable ethylene gas and sodium acetate.\n\nB. Under vacuum and heat, the ethanol impurity will catalytically decompose ethyl acetate into acetic acid and ethylene, leading to a dangerous pressure buildup from the gaseous ethylene.\n\nC. Trace amounts of sodium hydroxide, formed from the reaction of sodium with water, will cause rapid, exothermic saponification of the ethyl acetate, boiling the remaining solvent and causing the flask to over-pressurize.\n\nD. Sodium ethoxide, formed from the reaction of sodium with the ethanol impurity and the ester itself, will catalyze an exothermic, runaway base-catalyzed self-condensation of ethyl acetate, which can accelerate uncontrollably as the solvent is removed, leading to violent over-pressurization and glassware failure.\n\nE. The high vacuum of the rotary evaporator will lower the autoignition temperature of the ethyl acetate vapor, making it susceptible to ignition from the static electricity generated by the rotating flask.", "solution": "The central question asks which specific chemical hazard is most significant during rotary evaporation of ethyl acetate that has been contacted with sodium and contains residual ethanol and water impurities. The SDS excludes peroxide or simple thermal instability as root causes, so the reasoning must focus on reactive species generated in Step 1 and their effects during concentration under heat and vacuum.\n\nFirst, determine the likely reactive species present after Step 1 and filtration. Sodium reacts with ethanol and water to form strong base:\n$$\n2\\mathrm{Na} + 2\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}OH} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{NaOCH_{2}CH_{3}} + \\mathrm{H}_{2}\n$$\n$$\n2\\mathrm{Na} + 2\\mathrm{H_{2}O} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{NaOH} + \\mathrm{H}_{2}\n$$\nIn an ethyl acetate medium, sodium hydroxide is poorly soluble and is largely removed with solids upon filtration, while sodium ethoxide is soluble and will remain in the filtrate. Additionally, sodium ethoxide can be formed from sodium hydroxide and ethanol via acid-base exchange in ethanol-containing media:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NaOH} + \\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}OH} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{NaOCH_{2}CH_{3}} + \\mathrm{H_{2}O}\n$$\nThus, the filtrate entering the rotary evaporator plausibly contains ethyl acetate with dissolved sodium ethoxide and some ethanol.\n\nSecond, identify the dominant base-promoted reaction of ethyl acetate under these conditions. Sodium ethoxide promotes the Claisen self-condensation of ethyl acetate, generating ethyl acetoacetate and ethanol:\n$$\n2\\,\\mathrm{CH_{3}COOCH_{2}CH_{3}} \\xrightarrow[\\mathrm{NaOCH_{2}CH_{3}}]{\\text{base}} \\mathrm{CH_{3}COCH_{2}COOCH_{2}CH_{3}} + \\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}OH}\n$$\nMechanistically, ethoxide deprotonates the alpha position of ethyl acetate to form an enolate, which performs nucleophilic acyl substitution on a second ester molecule. A key feature is that this process is exothermic and generates ethanol as a byproduct. In the classical Claisen condensation, an equivalent of base is tied up by deprotonation of the product, but in practical mixed systems, continued formation of base via sodium-ethanol and sodium-water reactions, together with evolving equilibria and solvent changes, enables substantial conversion even from modest initial base levels. Importantly, the rate of base-catalyzed condensation increases with both temperature and base concentration.\n\nThird, analyze the effects specific to rotary evaporation. Rotary evaporation at elevated temperature and under reduced pressure accelerates several synergistic effects:\n- Removal of volatile ethanol (both impurity and reaction byproduct) by evaporation shifts the Claisen equilibrium toward products by Le Chatelier’s principle, increasing the reaction driving force.\n- Solvent removal concentrates both ethyl acetate and sodium ethoxide, increasing the reaction rate.\n- Warming increases reaction kinetics. Collectively, the heat generation rate $q_{\\text{gen}}$ rises, while the system’s thermal mass drops with solvent removal. If $q_{\\text{gen}} > q_{\\text{rem}}$ (heat removal by the bath and condenser), thermal runaway can occur, causing rapid boiling, bumping, and over-pressurization sufficient to cause glassware failure.\n- Evolving ethanol vapor (and any dissolved gases) contributes to vigorous vapor generation under vacuum, amplifying mechanical stress.\n\nFourth, evaluate and reject alternative options based on chemical principles:\n- Option A claims explosive reaction of residual sodium metal with ethyl acetate on heating to decompose the ester into ethylene and sodium acetate. This is not a recognized pathway; sodium is removed by filtration, and sodium does not thermally induce such a decomposition of ethyl acetate. Ethylene generation from ethyl acetate by sodium is implausible, and any residual sodium metal would be minimal and typically visible; the dominant hazard here is not sodium metal in the rotavap.\n- Option B proposes ethanol-catalyzed decomposition of ethyl acetate into acetic acid and ethylene under vacuum and heat. Ethanol is not a catalyst for such a transformation; ethylene arises from ethanol via acid-catalyzed dehydration at much higher temperatures and in strongly acidic media, not under basic, low-pressure conditions.\n- Option C invokes NaOH-driven saponification. In an anhydrous, nonpolar ester medium, NaOH is poorly soluble and saponification requires water; trace NaOH would not produce a rapid, runaway exotherm under these conditions. Moreover, any NaOH is largely removed with solids upon filtration.\n- Option E asserts that high vacuum lowers autoignition temperature enough for static ignition. Reduced pressure lowers oxygen partial pressure, generally reducing flammability risk in the evaporating flask; autoignition temperature is not lowered to cause spontaneous ignition by static within a standard rotovap, and this is not the historically documented cause of explosions in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most significant and probable chemical hazard during Step 4 is the exothermic, base-promoted self-condensation of ethyl acetate catalyzed by sodium ethoxide, which is intensified by solvent removal, heat, and ethanol stripping—precisely as described in Option D. This is a well-known and historically documented cause of violent events when concentrating or distilling ethyl acetate in the presence of alkoxide base.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2001456"}]}
