The main products of complete combustion are carbon dioxide and water vapor. Incomplete combustion, which also occurs, produces elemental carbon (soot) and carbon monoxide.\n- Ambient air is a homogeneous mixture composed primarily of nitrogen gas ($\\text{N}_2$, ~78%), oxygen gas ($\\text{O}_2$, ~21%), and argon gas ($\\text{Ar}$, ~1%).\n\nFrom the list below, select all options that correctly identify a substance or a group of substances present in this operating system and provide the correct classification according to the definitions of element, compound, and mixture.\n\nA.

The paraffin wax is described as a refined mixture of alkanes with general formula $ \\text{C}_n\\text{H}_{2n+2}$ where $n$ varies from $20$ to $40$.

Evaporate the water to recover the salt.", "solution": "Goal: separate a heterogeneous solid mixture of iron filings (Fe), sand (SiO2), and table salt (NaCl) into pure, dry solids using physical properties: magnetism, differential solubility in water, filtration, and evaporation.\n\nPrinciples used:\n- Ferromagnetism: iron filings are attracted to a magnet; SiO2 and NaCl are not. Thus, magnetic separation isolates Fe from the dry mixture efficiently without wetting or contamination.\n- Solubility: NaCl is highly soluble in water; SiO2 is effectively insoluble in water. Thus, adding water to the nonmagnetic residue dissolves NaCl while leaving SiO2 as a solid.\n- Filtration: a heterogeneous mixture of an insoluble solid and a solution can be separated; filter paper retains the insoluble SiO2 (residue), while the NaCl(aq) passes through (filtrate).\n- Evaporation: removing the solvent (water) from the NaCl(aq) filtrate yields solid NaCl crystals. Symbolically, dissolution corresponds to NaCl(s) dissolving into ions in water, and evaporation reverses this by removing solvent to re-form solid NaCl.\n\nCorrect, efficient sequence analysis:\n\nOption A:\n1. Use a magnet to remove the iron filings. This exploits ferromagnetism to isolate Fe from the dry mixture cleanly, preventing wetting and corrosion and minimizing cross-contamination.\n2. Add water to the remaining solid mixture and stir. This dissolves NaCl while SiO2 remains as an insoluble solid. Conceptually: NaCl(s) dissolves in water to give an aqueous solution, while SiO2(s) remains undissolved.\n3. Filter the resulting mixture. The filter retains SiO2 as the solid residue; the NaCl solution passes as the filtrate.\n4. Evaporate the water from the liquid that passes through the filter. Removal of solvent yields solid NaCl. After filtration, the SiO2 residue can be dried to obtain pure, dry sand; the Fe recovered in step 1 is already dry or can be briefly dried if needed. This sequence is efficient and correct.\n\nOption B:\n1–4 involve first wetting all components, then filtering to collect sand (but Fe would also be retained with sand), then evaporating to get NaCl, and finally using a magnet on wet sand to pull out Fe. This is less efficient and less correct operationally: using a magnet on a wet solid introduces adherence of wet particulates and potential oxidation of Fe, increasing contamination and drying steps.\n\nOption C:\nUsing a magnet on a slurry to extract Fe leads to wet, salt-contaminated Fe that requires rinsing and drying, which is inefficient and risks loss. Subsequent steps otherwise mirror the standard approach, but this ordering is inferior to removing Fe when dry.\n\nOption D:\nStates that NaCl can be evaporated from the mixture by heating. This is incorrect: NaCl does not evaporate under typical lab heating; it has negligible vapor pressure at such temperatures. Heating would not selectively remove NaCl and thus cannot effect the intended separation.\n\nOption E:\nProposes filtering the initial dry mixture, which is not a valid filtration operation because filtration separates phases in a liquid-solid mixture; it cannot separate dry solids of similar sizes without a fluid medium. This is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient and correct method is the sequence in A, which correctly and efficiently applies magnetism first on the dry mixture, then exploits solubility and filtration, and finally evaporation to recover each component as a pure, dry solid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1983845"}, {"introduction": "The properties of mixtures are not just conceptually different from pure substances; they are quantitatively predictable.
