The following three distinct phenomena are observed:\n\n*   **Phenomenon I**: The liquid nitrogen bubbles intensely and evaporates completely, forming a large volume of colorless gas.\n*   **Phenomenon II**: A dense white mist or cloud forms just above the surface of the dish and then gradually dissipates into the surrounding air.\n*   **Phenomenon III**: For a brief moment just as the liquid nitrogen disappears, a small amount of a pale blue liquid forms in the bottom of the dish and then it also boils away.\n\nAssume the air in the room is primarily composed of nitrogen ($\\text{N}_2$), oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$), and water vapor ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$). The boiling point of oxygen is 90.2 K.\n\nBased on the principles of physical and chemical changes, which of the following statements correctly classifies the observed phenomena?\n\nA. All three phenomena are physical changes.\n\nB. Phenomenon I is a physical change, while Phenomena II and III are chemical changes.\n\nC. Phenomena I and II are physical changes, while Phenomenon III is a chemical change.\n\nD. Phenomena I and III are physical changes, while Phenomenon II is a chemical change.\n\nE. Phenomenon I is a chemical change, while Phenomena II and III are physical changes.", "solution": "A physical change is defined as a process in which the chemical identity of the substance remains the same while its physical state or appearance changes. A chemical change is defined as a process in which chemical bonds are formed or broken, producing substances with different chemical identities. Under room conditions and standard atmospheric pressure, nitrogen and oxygen do not chemically react with each other or with water without an energy source sufficient to overcome activation barriers; thus, absent combustion, electrical discharge, or catalysts at high temperatures, chemical reactions are not expected in this demonstration.\n\nPhenomenon I: Liquid nitrogen at its normal boiling point $T_{\\text{b,N}_{2}}=77\\ \\text{K}$ is exposed to surroundings at $T_{\\text{room}}=298\\ \\text{K}$ and $p=p_{\\text{atm}}$. Heat flows from the surroundings into the liquid nitrogen, and at constant pressure the added heat drives the phase transition\n$$\\mathrm{N_{2}(l)\\ \\to\\ N_{2}(g)}.$$\nThis is vaporization, quantified by the enthalpy of vaporization via $q=n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$; the chemical species remains $\\mathrm{N_{2}}$ before and after. No chemical bonds are broken or formed; hence this is a physical change.\n\nPhenomenon II: The vigorous evaporation of $\\mathrm{N_{2}}$ cools the adjacent air by removing heat (the surroundings supply $q$ to provide $n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$), lowering the local air temperature. Let $p_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}$ denote the partial pressure of water vapor in the room air and $p_{\\text{sat}}(T)$ the saturation vapor pressure of water at temperature $T$. As the local $T$ drops, $p_{\\text{sat}}(T)$ decreases. When $p_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}>p_{\\text{sat}}(T)$, the air becomes supersaturated and water condenses:\n$$\\mathrm{H_{2}O(g)\\ \\to\\ H_{2}O(l)}.$$\nThe resulting micron-scale droplets scatter light, forming a white mist, which later re-evaporates as the air warms and $p_{\\text{sat}}(T)$ increases. This is condensation/evaporation of water, i.e., phase changes with the chemical identity $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ unchanged, so it is a physical change.\n\nPhenomenon III: Oxygen has a normal boiling point $T_{\\text{b,O}_{2}}=90.2\\ \\text{K}$. In the very cold region near the dish at approximately $77\\ \\text{K}$, the saturation vapor pressure of oxygen, $p_{\\text{sat,O}_{2}}(77\\ \\text{K})$, is well below its partial pressure in air, $p_{\\text{O}_{2}}$ (with $p_{\\text{O}_{2}}\\approx 0.21\\,p_{\\text{atm}}$). Thus $p_{\\text{O}_{2}}>p_{\\text{sat,O}_{2}}(77\\ \\text{K})$, and oxygen from the air condenses into a pale blue liquid:\n$$\\mathrm{O_{2}(g)\\ \\to\\ O_{2}(l)}.$$\nAs the cold region warms once the nitrogen is gone, this liquid oxygen boils away:\n$$\\mathrm{O_{2}(l)\\ \\to\\ O_{2}(g)}.$$\nThroughout, the species remains $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$; no new substances are formed. The pale blue color is characteristic of liquid oxygen and does not indicate a chemical reaction. Therefore, this phenomenon is also a physical change.\n\nConclusion: All three observed phenomena are physical changes.

This practice explores the fascinating phenomenon of a supersaturated solution rapidly solidifying, a process that becomes warm to the touch [@problem_id:2012051]. By analyzing this event, you'll learn to distinguish an exothermic physical change, like crystallization, from a chemical change, thereby refining your criteria for classifying transformations.", "problem": "A chemistry student prepares a solution by heating 80 grams of sodium acetate trihydrate ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COONa} \\cdot 3\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) in 10 milliliters of water until all the solid dissolves completely. The resulting clear solution is then allowed to cool undisturbed to room temperature. At this point, the solution is transparent with no solid present, despite containing a much higher concentration of sodium acetate than is normally soluble at room temperature. The student then initiates a change by dropping a single tiny crystal of solid sodium acetate into the solution. Immediately, a white solid rapidly grows from the seed crystal, converting the entire volume of the liquid into a solid mass within seconds. The student observes that the container becomes significantly warm to the touch during this rapid solidification.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best scientific explanation for these observations?\n\nA. A chemical reaction occurred, where the dissolved sodium acetate decomposed into new, more stable solid products, releasing energy as heat.\n\nB. A physical change occurred, where the excess dissolved sodium acetate solidified. This process is endothermic, absorbing energy from the surroundings, which is perceived as warmth.\n\nC. A physical change occurred, where the supersaturated solution underwent rapid crystallization. The process is exothermic, releasing the latent heat of fusion as the sodium acetate molecules organize into a solid lattice.\n\nD. A chemical change occurred, where the water and sodium acetate reacted to form a new hydrated compound that is solid at room temperature. The formation of new chemical bonds released heat.\n\nE. The solution was unstable due to being superheated, and adding the crystal caused it to rapidly boil, releasing steam and leaving behind the solid. The warmth is from the latent heat of vaporization.", "solution": "Heating increases solubility, so dissolving sodium acetate trihydrate at elevated temperature produces a clear solution with concentration $c$ greater than the equilibrium solubility $S(T)$ at room temperature. Upon cooling without nucleation, the solution remains supersaturated: $c > S(T_{\\text{room}})$. In this state, the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization is favorable, with the Gibbs free energy change for forming solid from a supersaturated solution satisfying $\\Delta G_{\\text{cryst}} < 0$ under the given conditions.\n\nHowever, supersaturated solutions are metastable due to a nucleation barrier. Classical nucleation considerations imply a positive free energy barrier $\\Delta G^{\\ast} > 0$ arising from interfacial energy, which prevents spontaneous crystallization in the absence of nuclei. Introducing a seed crystal provides a template that effectively lowers the nucleation barrier, initiating rapid crystal growth. This accounts for the immediate, volumetric solid formation observed upon adding a tiny crystal.\n\nThe observed warming of the container indicates that the process is exothermic, i.e., the enthalpy change for crystallization is negative: $\\Delta H_{\\text{cryst}} < 0$. As the solute molecules (or ions) organize into the crystalline lattice of sodium acetate trihydrate, the system releases heat (often termed the heat of crystallization; solidification generally releases the latent heat of fusion). This explains the noticeable temperature rise during rapid solidification.\n\nThese facts identify the process as a physical change (no new chemical species are formed; the composition corresponds to crystalline sodium acetate trihydrate) driven by supersaturation and nucleation, and exothermic due to lattice formation. Evaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because no chemical decomposition into new, more stable products occurs; the identity of the compound remains sodium acetate trihydrate.\n- B is incorrect because the process is not endothermic; the observed warming requires $\\Delta H < 0$.\n- C correctly describes a physical change, supersaturation-triggered rapid crystallization, and exothermic heat release upon lattice formation.\n- D is incorrect because it frames the event as a chemical reaction forming a new compound; crystallization of the hydrate from solution is a physical phase change.\n- E is incorrect because the phenomenon does not involve superheating or boiling; the transformation occurs at room temperature without steam.\n\nTherefore, the best scientific explanation is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2012051"}, {"introduction": "The distinction between physical and chemical changes has quantitative implications rooted in stoichiometry. This problem moves beyond simple classification by examining the slow chemical change that occurs as a bronze statue develops a patina over decades [@problem_id:2012081]. You will apply principles of mass conservation and molar mass to calculate the amount of reactant consumed, connecting a macroscopic observation to the underlying chemical reaction.", "problem": "A sculptor casts a large bronze statue with an initial mass of 500.00 kg. The bronze alloy used is composed of 90.0% copper and 10.0% tin by mass. The statue is installed outdoors, where it is exposed to atmospheric gases. Over several decades, a distinctive green patina forms on its surface. A chemical analysis of the patina reveals that its primary component is the mineral malachite, which has the chemical formula $\\text{Cu}_2(\\text{OH})_2\\text{CO}_3$. The overall chemical reaction for the formation of this patina from the copper in the statue is given by:\n\n$$2 \\text{ Cu}(s) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(g) + \\text{CO}_2(g) + \\text{O}_2(g) \\to \\text{Cu}_2(\\text{OH})_2\\text{CO}_3(s)$$\n\nAfter thirty years, the statue is carefully weighed again, and its total mass is found to be 501.38 kg. Assuming the entire increase in the statue's mass is due to the formation of malachite, calculate the total mass of copper from the statue that has been converted into the patina.\n\nThe molar masses of the relevant elements are provided for your calculation:\n-   H: 1.008 g/mol\n-   C: 12.011 g/mol\n-   O: 15.999 g/mol\n-   Cu: 63.546 g/mol\n\nExpress your answer in kilograms, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal of the problem is to determine the mass of copper, $m_{Cu, reacted}$, that has reacted to form the patina.\n\nFirst, we identify the change in the total mass of the statue. Let $M_{initial}$ be the initial mass and $M_{final}$ be the final mass.\nThe mass increase, $\\Delta M$, is:\n$$ \\Delta M = M_{final} - M_{initial} = 501.38 \\text{ kg} - 500.00 \\text{ kg} = 1.38 \\text{ kg} $$\n\nThis mass increase is due to the incorporation of atoms from the atmosphere (hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen) into the solid patina. The overall mass of the solid object increases because the mass of the patina formed, $m_{patina}$, is greater than the mass of the copper consumed from the statue, $m_{Cu, reacted}$. The difference between these two masses must equal the mass of the atmospheric components added.\nTherefore, the change in mass of the statue can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta M = m_{patina} - m_{Cu, reacted} $$\n\nTo solve for $m_{Cu, reacted}$, we need to relate $m_{patina}$ to $m_{Cu, reacted}$ using stoichiometry.
