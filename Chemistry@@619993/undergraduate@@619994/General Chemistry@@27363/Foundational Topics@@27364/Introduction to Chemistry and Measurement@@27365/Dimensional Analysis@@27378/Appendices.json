This practice demonstrates how to determine a property that is nearly impossible to measure directly—the thickness of a piece of gold foil—by using macroscopic measurements of mass, density, and area. By carefully tracking and converting units from troy ounces and yards to grams and meters, you will calculate a dimension on the nanometer scale, highlighting the remarkable malleability of gold [@problem_id:1989995].", "problem": "Gold is an exceptionally malleable metal, meaning it can be hammered or pressed into a very thin sheet without breaking. This thin sheet is known as gold leaf.\n\nSuppose one troy ounce of pure gold is perfectly hammered into a uniform foil that completely covers the area of a standard American football playing field (excluding the end zones). Using the data provided below, calculate the resulting thickness of the gold foil.\n\n**Given Data:**\n- Density of gold: $19.3 \\text{ g/cm}^3$\n- Mass conversion: $1 \\text{ troy ounce} = 31.1035 \\text{ g}$\n- Football field dimensions: $100.0 \\text{ yards}$ in length and $53.33 \\text{ yards}$ in width\n- Length conversion: $1 \\text{ yard} = 0.9144 \\text{ m}$\n\nExpress your answer in nanometers (nm), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to find the thickness, $T$, of the gold foil. The volume, $V$, of the foil can be expressed as its area, $A$, multiplied by its thickness, $T$.\n$$V = A \\times T$$\nTherefore, the thickness can be calculated as:\n$$T = \\frac{V}{A}$$\nWe can find the volume from the mass and density of gold, and the area from the given dimensions of the football field. We will perform the calculations by converting all units to a consistent system, such as meters for length and grams for mass.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the mass of the gold in grams.**\nThe problem states the mass of gold is one troy ounce.
