While technical specifications for commercial products, such as batteries for electric vehicles, commonly use the unit of watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), fundamental scientific analysis requires adherence to the International System of Units (SI). For consistency in scientific literature and calculations, it is essential to express specific energy in the SI derived unit of joules per kilogram (J/kg).\n\nSuppose a new prototype energy storage device has a reported specific energy of exactly 1 Wh/kg. What is the numerical value of its specific energy when expressed in the units of J/kg?", "solution": "The problem requires converting a specific energy value from the unit of watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) to joules per kilogram (J/kg). To do this, we need to find the conversion factor between a watt-hour (Wh) and a joule (J).\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions of the relevant SI units. The joule (J) is the SI unit of energy. The watt (W) is the SI unit of power, which is the rate of energy transfer. One watt is defined as one joule per second.\n$$1 \\text{ W} = 1 \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{s}}$$\n\nA watt-hour (Wh) is a unit of energy, representing the total energy delivered if a power of one watt is sustained for one hour. We can express this relationship mathematically:\n$$1 \\text{ Wh} = 1 \\text{ W} \\times 1 \\text{ hour}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the definition of the watt in terms of joules and seconds into this equation:\n$$1 \\text{ Wh} = \\left(1 \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{s}}\\right) \\times (1 \\text{ hour})$$\n\nTo resolve the units, we need to express the time in seconds, as the definition of the watt involves seconds. We know the conversion from hours to seconds:\n$$1 \\text{ hour} = 60 \\text{ minutes}$$\n$$1 \\text{ minute} = 60 \\text{ seconds}$$\nTherefore, the number of seconds in one hour is:\n$$1 \\text{ hour} = 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 3600 \\text{ s}$$\n\nNow, substitute this value back into our expression for the watt-hour:\n$$1 \\text{ Wh} = \\left(1 \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{s}}\\right) \\times (3600 \\text{ s})$$\n\nThe unit of seconds (s) in the denominator cancels with the unit of seconds in the numerator, leaving us with joules:\n$$1 \\text{ Wh} = 3600 \\text{ J}$$\n\nThe original problem is about specific energy, which has units of energy per mass. We started with 1 Wh/kg. Using our conversion factor:\n$$1 \\frac{\\text{Wh}}{\\text{kg}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ Wh}}{1 \\text{ kg}} = \\frac{3600 \\text{ J}}{1 \\text{ kg}} = 3600 \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{kg}}$$\n\nThus, a specific energy of 1 Wh/kg is equivalent to 3600 J/kg.
