By comparing a high-spin and a low-spin complex of cobalt(III), you will practice the crucial skill of counting unpaired electrons, which is the foundation for predicting magnetism.", "problem": "A chemist is investigating the electronic structure and magnetic properties of two coordination compounds of cobalt. Both complexes feature a central cobalt ion in an octahedral coordination environment.\n\nThe first complex, let's call it Complex A, is an ionic salt containing the hexafluorocobaltate(III) anion, $[\\text{CoF}_6]^{3-}$. The fluoride ligand, F⁻, is situated at the low end of the spectrochemical series and is considered a weak-field ligand.\n\nThe second complex, Complex B, is a salt containing the hexaamminecobalt(III) cation, $[\\text{Co(NH}_3)_6]^{3+}$. The ammonia ligand, NH₃, is a strong-field ligand, causing a larger splitting of the d-orbital energies.\n\nBased on the principles of crystal field theory, determine the absolute difference in the number of unpaired d-electrons on the central cobalt ion between Complex A and Complex B.", "solution": "Identify the oxidation state of cobalt in both complexes using charge balance.\nFor Complex A, $\\left[\\mathrm{CoF}_{6}\\right]^{3-}$: each $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ contributes $-1$, so\n$$x + 6(-1) = -3 \\implies x = +3.$$\nFor Complex B, $\\left[\\mathrm{Co(NH_{3})}_{6}\\right]^{3+}$: each $\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$ is neutral, so\n$$x + 6(0) = +3 \\implies x = +3.$$\nThus cobalt is $\\mathrm{Co}^{3+}$ in both complexes.\n\nDetermine the $d$-electron count for $\\mathrm{Co}^{3+}$. Neutral Co has configuration $[\\mathrm{Ar}]\\,3d^{7}4s^{2}$. Removing two $4s$ and one $3d$ electrons for $+3$ charge gives\n$$\\mathrm{Co}^{3+}: 3d^{6}.$$\n\nApply octahedral crystal field theory. The $d$ orbitals split into lower $t_{2g}$ and higher $e_{g}$ levels. The spin state depends on the relative magnitudes of the octahedral splitting $\\Delta_{o}$ and the pairing energy $P$.\n\n- For Complex A with $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ (weak-field ligand), $\\Delta_{o} < P$, so the complex is high spin. For a $d^{6}$ ion in high spin, electrons first singly occupy all five $d$ orbitals (Hund's rule), then the sixth pairs in a $t_{2g}$ orbital, yielding\n$$t_{2g}^{4}e_{g}^{2}.$$\nCount unpaired electrons: in $t_{2g}^{4}$ there are two unpaired, and in $e_{g}^{2}$ there are two unpaired, for a total of $4$ unpaired electrons.\n\n- For Complex B with $\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$ (strong-field ligand), $\\Delta_{o} > P$, so the complex is low spin. For a $d^{6}$ ion in low spin, electrons pair in $t_{2g}$ before occupying $e_{g}$, yielding\n$$t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}.$$\nAll electrons are paired, so there are $0$ unpaired electrons.\n\nCompute the absolute difference in the number of unpaired electrons:\n$$\\left|4 - 0\\right| = 4.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1985931"}, {"introduction": "The vibrant colors of many transition metal complexes are a direct consequence of their d-orbital splitting.
