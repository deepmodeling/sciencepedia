The coordination number is six, and all ligands are monodentate.\n\nFirst, consider structural (linkage) isomerism due to the ambidentate nitrite ligand. The $NO_{2}^{-}$ ligand can coordinate either through nitrogen (nitro) or through oxygen (nitrito). Since the two oxygen atoms in $NO_{2}^{-}$ are equivalent, there are exactly two distinct linkage modes:\n- nitro: $M-NO_{2}$ (N-bound),\n- nitrito: $M-ONO$ (O-bound).\nThus, the number of linkage isomers is\n$$N_{\\text{linkage}}=2.$$\n\nNext, consider geometrical isomerism in the octahedral $MA_{4}BC$ type.

All ligands are achiral; the bidentate ligand C-C is symmetric. For each composition, we enumerate distinct geometrical arrangements (*cis*/*trans*, *fac*/*mer*) and then test each for chirality (presence or absence of any improper symmetry element such as a mirror plane or inversion center).\n\nFor Complex 1, $[MA_{4}B_{2}]$, there are two geometric isomers depending on the relative disposition of the two $B$ ligands: *trans* (the two $B$ ligands opposite each other) and *cis* (the two $B$ ligands adjacent). The *trans* isomer has a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral. The *cis* isomer possesses at least one mirror plane (for example, a plane containing $M$ and the two $B$ ligands), hence it is also achiral. Therefore the total number of stereoisomers is\n$$\n2.\n$$\n\nFor Complex 2, $[MA_{3}B_{3}]$, there are two geometric isomers: facial (*fac*), where the three $A$ ligands occupy one face of the octahedron, and meridional (*mer*), where the three $A$ ligands lie in a meridional plane. The *fac* isomer has $C_{3v}$ symmetry (three vertical mirror planes) and is achiral. The *mer* isomer has a mirror plane (typically $C_{2v}$) and is also achiral. Therefore the total number of stereoisomers is\n$$\n2.\n$$\n\nFor Complex 3, $[MA_{2}(C-C)_{2}]$, the two monodentate $A$ ligands can be either *trans* or *cis* to each other, giving two geometric isomers. The *trans* isomer has a center of symmetry and is achiral. The *cis* isomer with two symmetric, achiral bidentate ligands has no mirror plane or inversion center because the two chelate rings impose a helical arrangement around the metal, yielding a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (the $\\Delta$ and $\\Lambda$ enantiomers). Thus the *cis* form is optically active and contributes two stereoisomers, while the *trans* form contributes one.
