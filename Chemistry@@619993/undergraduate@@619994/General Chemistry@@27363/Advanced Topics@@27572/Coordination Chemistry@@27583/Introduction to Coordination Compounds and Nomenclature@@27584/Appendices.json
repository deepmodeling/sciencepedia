This first practice problem challenges you to do just that, using a compound known historically as Fischer's salt.

Determining the oxidation states of the two separate platinum centers requires more than simple algebra; it calls upon your chemical reasoning about the preferred coordination geometries for different metal oxidation states, such as Pt(II) and Pt(IV).

One such salt has the empirical formula $[\\text{Pt(NH}_3)_4][\\text{Pt(S}_5)_3]$. In this compound, one platinum center is coordinated by four neutral ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) ligands. The other platinum center is coordinated by three chelating polysulfido ligands. Based on your knowledge of coordination chemistry principles and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature, provide the complete, systematic name for this salt.", "solution": "The problem asks for the systematic IUPAC name of the salt $[\\text{Pt(NH}_3)_4][\\text{Pt(S}_5)_3]$. Naming this compound requires determining the charges of the complex cation and anion, which in turn requires finding the oxidation state of each platinum center.\n\nStep 1: Identify the cation and anion and their charges.\nThe compound is an ionic salt composed of a complex cation, $[\\text{Pt(NH}_3)_4]^{z+}$, and a complex anion, $[\\text{Pt(S}_5)_3]^{z-}$. For the salt to be neutral, the magnitude of the charge on the cation and anion must be equal, which we denote by `z`.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the ligands and their charges.\nThe cation contains four ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) ligands. Ammonia is a neutral molecule, so its charge is 0.\nThe anion contains three $\\text{S}_5$ ligands. The $\\text{S}_5$ unit is a polysulfido ligand. Polysulfido ions are a well-known class of anions with the general formula $S_n^{2-}$. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign the $\\text{S}_5$ ligand a charge of -2. It acts as a bidentate chelating ligand, forming a ring with the central metal atom.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation relating the oxidation states of the platinum centers.\nLet `OS_cat` be the oxidation state of platinum in the cation $[\\text{Pt(NH}_3)_4]^{z+}$. The charge of the cation is given by:\n`z = OS_cat + 4 \\times (\\text{charge of } NH_3) = OS_cat + 4 \\times (0)`\n`z = OS_cat`\n\nLet `OS_an` be the oxidation state of platinum in the anion $[\\text{Pt(S}_5)_3]^{z-}$. The charge of the anion is given by:\n`-z = OS_an + 3 \\times (\\text{charge of } S_5^{2-}) = OS_an + 3 \\times (-2)`\n`-z = OS_an - 6`\n`z = 6 - OS_an`\n\nEquating the two expressions for `z`, we get:\n`OS_cat = 6 - OS_an`\n`OS_cat + OS_an = 6`\n\nStep 4: Resolve the ambiguity in oxidation states.\nThis equation has multiple integer solutions for the oxidation states. However, the most common oxidation states for platinum are +2 and +4. We can test the two plausible pairs that sum to 6:\nCase A: `OS_cat = +2` and `OS_an = +4`\nCase B: `OS_cat = +4` and `OS_an = +2`\n\nTo decide between these cases, we consider the typical coordination environments for Pt(II) and Pt(IV).\nThe cation $[\\text{Pt(NH}_3)_4]$ has a coordination number of 4. Pt(II) complexes are overwhelmingly 4-coordinate and adopt a square planar geometry.\nThe anion $[\\text{Pt(S}_5)_3]$ has three bidentate $\\text{S}_5^{2-}$ ligands, resulting in a coordination number of 6 for the platinum center. Pt(IV) complexes are almost exclusively 6-coordinate and adopt an octahedral geometry.\n\nThis analysis strongly supports Case A. Assigning Pt(II) to the 4-coordinate cation and Pt(IV) to the 6-coordinate anion is the most chemically reasonable solution.\n\nSo we have:\n- Platinum in the cation has an oxidation state of +2: `OS_cat = +2`.\n- Platinum in the anion has an oxidation state of +4: `OS_an = +4`.\n\nThis assignment leads to a charge of `z = OS_cat = +2` for the cation, $[\\text{Pt(NH}_3)_4]^{2+}$, and a charge of `-z = OS_an - 6 = 4 - 6 = -2` for the anion, $[\\text{Pt(S}_5)_3]^{2-}$. The charges are equal and opposite, confirming a consistent model.\n\nStep 5: Name the complex cation $[\\text{Pt(NH}_3)_4]^{2+}`.\n- Ligands: There are four (`tetra`) $\\text{NH}_3$ ligands (`ammine`). The ligand part of the name is \"tetraammine\".\n- Metal: The complex is a cation, so the metal name is \"platinum\".\n- Oxidation State: The oxidation state is +2, written as \"(II)\".\n- Cation Name: `tetraammineplatinum(II)`\n\nStep 6: Name the complex anion $[\\text{Pt(S}_5)_3]^{2-}`.\n- Ligands: There are three (`tris`) $\\text{S}_5^{2-}$ ligands. The ligand is named \"pentasulfido\". Since the ligand name is polysyllabic and to avoid ambiguity, we use the prefix \"tris\" and enclose the ligand name in parentheses. The ligand part is \"tris(pentasulfido)\".\n- Metal: The complex is an anion, so the metal name suffix changes to \"-ate\": \"platinate\".\n- Oxidation State: The oxidation state is +4, written as \"(IV)\".\n- Anion Name: `tris(pentasulfido)platinate(IV)`\n\nStep 7: Assemble the full name of the salt.\nThe IUPAC convention is to write the name of the cation followed by the name of the anion, separated by a space.\n\nFull Name: `tetraammineplatinum(II) tris(pentasulfido)platinate(IV)`", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{tetraammineplatinum(II) tris(pentasulfido)platinate(IV)}}$$", "id": "1999962"}]}
