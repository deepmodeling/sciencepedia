{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the structure of an alloy begins with a fundamental question: where do the solute atoms reside in the host lattice? The relative size of the solute and solvent atoms provides the primary clue, as a significant size difference often dictates whether an atom will substitute for a host atom or fit into an interstitial void. This practice will challenge you to apply this principle to a common and important alloy, steel, which contains both substitutional and interstitial elements [@problem_id:1977949].", "problem": "A materials science team is formulating a new type of steel intended for high-stress structural applications. The proposed alloy consists of a primary metal host, iron (Fe), with the addition of two other elements, nickel (Ni) and carbon (C), to modify its properties. The final composition of the alloy by atom percent is approximately 95% Fe, 4% Ni, and 1% C. To predict the microstructure and resulting mechanical properties of this new material, it is essential to understand how the solute atoms (Ni and C) are incorporated into the solvent's (Fe) crystal lattice.\n\nGiven the following atomic radii, determine the nature of the solid solution formed by each of the solute elements within the iron matrix.\n- Atomic radius of Iron (Fe): 126 pm\n- Atomic radius of Nickel (Ni): 124 pm\n- Atomic radius of Carbon (C): 77 pm\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the arrangement of the atoms in this alloy?\n\nA.

A necessary condition is that the atomic radius mismatch satisfies the Hume-Rothery criterion: \n$$\\frac{|r_{\\text{solute}}-r_{\\text{solvent}}|}{r_{\\text{solvent}}} \\lesssim 0.15.$$\n- Interstitial solid solution: sufficiently small solute atoms occupy interstitial sites in the solvent lattice.\n\nGiven $r_{\\text{Fe}}=126\\,\\text{pm}$, $r_{\\text{Ni}}=124\\,\\text{pm}$, and $r_{\\text{C}}=77\\,\\text{pm}$:\n\n1) Nickel in iron (substitutional test):\n$$\\frac{|r_{\\text{Ni}}-r_{\\text{Fe}}|}{r_{\\text{Fe}}}=\\frac{|124-126|}{126}=\\frac{2}{126}=\\frac{1}{63}\\approx 0.01587<0.15.$$\nThis small mismatch satisfies the Hume-Rothery size rule. Furthermore, Fe and Ni are both transition metals with similar bonding and comparable crystal structures over relevant temperatures, supporting substitutional incorporation of Ni in Fe.\n\n2) Carbon in iron (substitutional test):\n$$\\frac{|r_{\\text{C}}-r_{\\text{Fe}}|}{r_{\\text{Fe}}}=\\frac{|77-126|}{126}=\\frac{49}{126}=\\frac{7}{18}\\approx 0.3889>0.15.$$\nThe size mismatch is far too large for substitutional solubility. Carbon atoms are much smaller and, in steels, are well known to occupy interstitial sites in both bcc ferrite (with very limited solubility) and fcc austenite (with higher solubility), implying an interstitial solid solution behavior for C in Fe.\n\nTherefore, Nickel forms a substitutional solid solution with iron, while Carbon forms an interstitial solid solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1977949"}, {"introduction": "While chemists and materials scientists often think in terms of atomic ratios, in the laboratory and industry, materials are measured by mass.
