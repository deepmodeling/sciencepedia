This exercise focuses on predicting the outcome of doping a Group 14 semiconductor (silicon) with a Group 13 element (gallium). This practice challenges you to apply your knowledge of atomic structure and covalent bonding to determine the resulting semiconductor type (p-type or n-type) and identify the majority charge carriers, a foundational concept in semiconductor technology [@problem_id:2016297].", "problem": "A materials engineer is tasked with creating a custom semiconductor for a specialized sensor. The process begins with an ingot of ultrapure crystalline silicon (Si). This silicon is then \"doped\" by introducing a trace amount of gallium (Ga) atoms, such that some silicon atoms in the crystal lattice are replaced by gallium atoms. Silicon is an element in Group 14 of the periodic table, and gallium is in Group 13.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the type of semiconductor created and the nature of its majority charge carriers responsible for electrical current?\n\nA. The material is n-type, and the majority charge carriers are free electrons.\n\nB. The material is p-type, and the majority charge carriers are mobile Ga³⁺ ions.\n\nC. The material is p-type, and the majority charge carriers are electron holes.\n\nD. The material is intrinsic, and the charge carriers are an equal number of electrons and holes.\n\nE. The material is n-type, and the majority charge carriers are protons.", "solution": "Silicon is a Group 14 element with four valence electrons, forming four covalent bonds in the crystalline lattice. When a Group 13 element such as gallium, which has three valence electrons, substitutes for Si in the lattice, it forms only three covalent bonds and leaves one bond electron-deficient. This deficiency corresponds to a missing electron in the valence band, described as a hole.\n\nIn semiconductor band terms, an acceptor impurity introduces an energy level $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$ slightly above the valence band edge $E_{\\mathrm{V}}$. At typical temperatures, thermal energy $k_{B}T$ allows an electron from the valence band to be captured by the acceptor level, ionizing the acceptor to a negatively charged state and leaving behind a mobile hole in the valence band. Thus, Ga in Si acts as an acceptor dopant, creating a $p$-type semiconductor, where the majority carriers are holes. In charge neutrality for a nondegenerate, fully ionized $p$-type semiconductor with acceptor concentration $N_{A}$ and negligible donor concentration, one has $p \\approx N_{A}$ and $n = \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{p}$, where $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration; this confirms holes dominate conduction.\n\nEliminating the incorrect options:\n- $n$-type requires donor dopants (Group 15, five valence electrons), which supply conduction-band electrons; Ga is Group 13, so option A is incorrect.\n- Mobile ions such as $\\mathrm{Ga}^{3+}$ do not act as majority charge carriers in a covalent crystal; ions are bound to lattice sites, and current in semiconductors is carried by electrons and holes, not by lattice ions. Hence option B is incorrect.\n- Intrinsic material has no intentional dopants and satisfies $n = p = n_{i}$; the described material is extrinsic due to Ga doping, so option D is incorrect.\n- Protons are not charge carriers in crystalline Si; conduction is electronic (electrons and holes). Hence option E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Ga-doped Si is $p$-type, and the majority carriers are electron holes, which matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2016297"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics of single-dopant systems, we now explore a powerful technique known as compensation doping, where both donor and acceptor impurities are introduced into the same crystal. This practice examines a silicon wafer doped with both boron (an acceptor) and phosphorus (a donor). By calculating the net effect of these two dopants, you will determine the final type of the semiconductor and the concentration of its majority charge carriers [@problem_id:2016286]. This principle is fundamental to the fabrication of complex electronic structures like p-n junctions, which are the building blocks of transistors and diodes.", "problem": "In the fabrication of modern integrated circuits, a technique known as counter-doping is used to precisely control the electrical properties of semiconductor regions. A specific region within a pure silicon wafer is first uniformly doped with boron (a Group 13 element), resulting in an acceptor concentration of $N_A = 4.5 \\times 10^{16}$ atoms/$\\text{cm}^3$.

Express your answer in carriers/$\\text{cm}^3$, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the majority charge carrier concentration in a silicon sample that has been doped with both acceptor and donor atoms, a process known as compensation doping.\n\nFirst, we must identify the role of each dopant. Silicon (Si) is a Group 14 element. Boron (B) is a Group 13 element, meaning it has one fewer valence electron than silicon. When a boron atom substitutes a silicon atom in the crystal lattice, it creates a \"hole,\" which is the absence of an electron in the valence band. This hole can accept an electron, so boron acts as an acceptor dopant, creating a p-type semiconductor. The concentration of acceptors is given as $N_A = 4.5 \\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$.\n\nPhosphorus (P) is a Group 15 element, meaning it has one more valence electron than silicon. When a phosphorus atom substitutes a silicon atom, this extra electron is loosely bound and can be easily donated to the conduction band, becoming a free charge carrier. Thus, phosphorus acts as a donor dopant, creating an n-type semiconductor. The concentration of donors is given as $N_D = 1.2 \\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$.\n\nWhen both donors and acceptors are present in the same region, the free electrons from the donor atoms will first fill the holes created by the acceptor atoms. This process is called compensation. The net type of the semiconductor and the concentration of the majority carriers are determined by the difference between the donor and acceptor concentrations.\n\nWe compare the concentrations $N_D$ and $N_A$:\n$N_D = 1.2 \\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$\n$N_A = 4.5 \\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$\n\nSince $N_D > N_A$, the donor concentration is higher than the acceptor concentration. After all the acceptor sites have captured an electron from the donor atoms, there will still be an excess of electrons. Therefore, the counter-doped material is n-type, and the majority charge carriers are electrons.\n\nThe concentration of the majority carriers (electrons), denoted by $n$, is approximately equal to the net effective donor concentration, which is the difference between the donor and acceptor concentrations.\n$$n \\approx N_D - N_A$$\nThe problem states that the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ is negligible, which validates this approximation.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$n \\approx (1.2 \\times 10^{17} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}) - (4.5 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3})$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we can express both terms with the same power of 10.
