Mastering the ability to systematically identify and draw these isomers is a foundational skill in organic chemistry. This exercise challenges you to explore the isomers of $C_4H_{10}O$ that are alcohols, and further classify them based on the structure around the hydroxyl group, linking connectivity to chemical categories like primary ($1^\\circ$), secondary ($2^\\circ$), and tertiary ($3^\\circ$) alcohols. [@problem_id:2000195]", "problem": "Constitutional isomers are molecules that share the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement of bonded atoms. An alcohol is an organic compound that contains at least one hydroxyl (–OH) functional group attached to a saturated carbon atom. Consider the molecular formula $C_4H_{10}O$. An analyst is tasked with identifying all unique constitutional isomers that are alcohols and classifying them based on the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is attached. A primary (1°) alcohol has the –OH group bonded to a carbon that is itself bonded to only one other carbon atom. A secondary (2°) alcohol has the –OH group bonded to a carbon that is bonded to two other carbon atoms. A tertiary (3°) alcohol has the –OH group bonded to a carbon that is bonded to three other carbon atoms.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly represents the number of unique primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohol isomers, respectively, for the molecular formula $C_4H_{10}O$?\n\nA. 1, 2, 1\n\nB. 2, 1, 1\n\nC. 2, 2, 0\n\nD. 3, 0, 1\n\nE. 1, 1, 2", "solution": "We identify the structural class first. A saturated, acyclic alcohol has general formula $C_{n}H_{2n+2}O$. For $C_{4}H_{10}O$, this matches with $n=4$, so only acyclic alcohols derived from $C_{4}$ alkanes are possible; cyclic alcohols would have $H=2n$ and are excluded.\n\nEnumerate the $C_{4}$ carbon skeletons:\n- Straight-chain butane (n-butane).\n- Branched isobutane (2-methylpropane).\n\nPlace the hydroxyl group on symmetry-distinct carbons and classify:\n- On n-butane:\n  - Terminal carbon gives 1-butanol, a primary alcohol.\n  - Internal carbon gives 2-butanol, a secondary alcohol. The two internal positions are symmetry-equivalent, and enantiomers of 2-butanol are not distinct constitutional isomers.\n- On isobutane:\n  - A primary methyl carbon gives 2-methyl-1-propanol (isobutanol), a primary alcohol; the three methyl positions are equivalent by symmetry.\n  - The tertiary central carbon gives 2-methyl-2-propanol (tert-butanol), a tertiary alcohol.\n\nThus the unique alcohol constitutional isomers are:\n- Primary: 1-butanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol, so count $2$.\n- Secondary: 2-butanol, so count $1$.\n- Tertiary: 2-methyl-2-propanol, so count $1$.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\\text{Primary} = 2,\\quad \\text{Secondary} = 1,\\quad \\text{Tertiary} = 1,$$\nwhich corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2000195"}, {"introduction": "Before attempting to draw a complex structure, chemists often perform a quick calculation to gain vital clues from the molecular formula alone.
