The first ionization energy corresponds to the energy required to remove an electron from the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO).

Oxygen is significantly more electronegative than nitrogen. This increased electronegativity pulls the $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals to a much lower energy than the $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital, causing the order to invert.\n\nB. The energy difference between the 2s and 2p atomic orbitals is small in nitrogen but larger in oxygen. This leads to significant mixing between the $\\sigma_{2s}$ and $\\sigma_{2p}$ molecular orbitals in $N_2$, which raises the energy of the $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital above the $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals. In $O_2$, this mixing is negligible.\n\nC. $O_2$ has two more valence electrons than $N_2$. The additional electrons in $O_2$ occupy the $\\pi^{*}_{2p}$ orbitals, and the resulting electron-electron repulsion raises the energy of all $\\pi$ orbitals above the $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital.\n\nD. The triple bond in $N_2$ is shorter and stronger than the double bond in $O_2$. The shorter bond distance in $N_2$ enhances the overlap for $\\pi$ orbitals more than for $\\sigma$ orbitals, raising the energy of the $\\pi_{2p}$ above the $\\sigma_{2p}$.\n\nE. The effective nuclear charge is higher in oxygen. This causes a uniform contraction of all atomic orbitals, but the effect is more pronounced on the p-orbitals, leading to a stronger $\\sigma$ bond and a lower energy $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital relative to the $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals.", "solution": "We analyze the observed change in the relative ordering of the $\\sigma_{2p}$ and $\\pi_{2p}$ molecular orbitals between $N_{2}$ and $O_{2}$ using linear combination of atomic orbitals and symmetry-allowed mixing (also called $s$–$p$ mixing). The key principle is that molecular orbitals of the same symmetry mix if they are close in energy, producing level repulsion: the higher-energy orbital is pushed up and the lower-energy orbital is pushed down. In homonuclear diatomics, the $\\sigma_{2s}$ and $\\sigma_{2p}$ bonding orbitals both have $\\sigma_{g}$ symmetry and can therefore mix; the $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals have different symmetry and do not mix with $\\sigma$ orbitals.\n\nLet $E_{s}$ and $E_{p}$ be the unperturbed energies of the $\\sigma_{2s}$ and $\\sigma_{2p}$ bonding orbitals and let $V_{sp}=\\langle \\sigma_{2s}|\\hat{H}|\\sigma_{2p}\\rangle$ be the coupling.

Meanwhile, the $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals do not mix with $\\sigma_{2s}$ by symmetry, so their energy remains essentially unchanged relative to the unperturbed $2p$ level.\n\nAcross the period from nitrogen to oxygen, the effective nuclear charge increases and stabilizes the $2s$ atomic orbitals more strongly than the $2p$ orbitals due to greater penetration of $s$ orbitals. Consequently, the atomic $2s$–$2p$ energy separation, and hence the corresponding MO $\\sigma_{2s}$–$\\sigma_{2p}$ separation, increases from $N_{2}$ to $O_{2}$. Therefore:\n- In $N_{2}$, the $2s$–$2p$ gap is relatively small, $|E_{p}-E_{s}|$ is small, so $\\Delta E_{p}\\approx V_{sp}^{2}/(E_{p}-E_{s})$ is sizable. This pushes $\\sigma_{2p}$ up above $\\pi_{2p}$, making the HOMO $\\sigma_{2p}$.\n- In $O_{2}$, the $2s$–$2p$ gap is larger, so $\\Delta E_{p}$ is much smaller and the mixing is negligible; the nonmixed ordering is restored with $\\sigma_{2p}$ below $\\pi_{2p}$, and the HOMO derives from the $\\pi^{*}_{2p}$ set.\n\nThis mechanism precisely matches the content of option B. The other options are inconsistent with symmetry and mixing principles: A overattributes to electronegativity without accounting for symmetry-selective mixing; C incorrectly ties ordering to added electrons and global repulsion rather than orbital interactions; D misstates how overlap affects $\\sigma$ versus $\\pi$ energies and cannot explain a systematic inversion; E claims a stronger effect on $p$ than $s$, which is opposite to the well-established greater stabilization of $s$ and consequent increase of the $2s$–$2p$ gap that reduces mixing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1382250"}]}
