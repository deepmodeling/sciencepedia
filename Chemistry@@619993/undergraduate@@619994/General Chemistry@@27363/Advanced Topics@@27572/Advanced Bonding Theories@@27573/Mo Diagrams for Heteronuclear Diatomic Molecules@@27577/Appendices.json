A key principle is that a higher bond order generally leads to a shorter, stronger bond.

The actual strength of a covalent bond also depends on the effectiveness of orbital mixing, which is governed by the energy difference between the combining atomic orbitals. This problem delves into this more nuanced aspect of MO theory by asking you to explain why the bond in carbon monoxide (CO) is significantly stronger than in boron monofluoride (BF), even though both molecules have a predicted bond order of 3 [@problem_id:2004478].", "problem": "Carbon monoxide (CO) and boron monofluoride (BF) are isoelectronic diatomic molecules, each possessing 10 valence electrons. Experimental data reveals that the dissociation energy of the C-O bond is 1072 kJ/mol, while that of the B-F bond is significantly lower at 755 kJ/mol, indicating a stronger bond in carbon monoxide.\n\nBased on Molecular Orbital (MO) theory, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for this difference in bond strength? For your reasoning, recall that the electronegativity of second-period elements increases in the order B &lt; C &lt; O &lt; F, and that the energy of an atomic orbital decreases (becomes more stable) as the electronegativity of the atom increases.\n\nA. The bond order of CO is 3, while the bond order of BF is 2, leading to a stronger bond in CO.\nB. The smaller electronegativity difference between C and O compared to B and F results in a less polar, and therefore stronger, covalent bond in CO.\nC. The atomic orbitals of carbon and oxygen have a smaller energy difference than those of boron and fluorine, leading to more effective orbital mixing and greater stabilization of the bonding molecular orbitals in CO.\nD. CO has more electrons occupying bonding molecular orbitals than BF does, which directly results in a stronger and more stable bond.\nE. The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) in CO is a bonding $\\pi$ orbital, whereas in BF it is a non-bonding $\\sigma$ orbital, contributing to the greater stability of CO.", "solution": "We begin by establishing the electron count and the baseline MO occupancy pattern. Both CO and BF are isoelectronic with a total of 10 valence electrons: for CO, carbon contributes 4 and oxygen 6; for BF, boron contributes 3 and fluorine 7.\n\nAccording to simple MO theory for second-period diatomics with 10 valence electrons, the qualitative filling (ignoring fine details of level ordering that do not change the total bonding versus antibonding counts for this electron number) proceeds as follows: fill $\\sigma(2s)$ with 2 electrons, $\\sigma^{\\ast}(2s)$ with 2 electrons, then place 6 electrons in the $2p$-derived MOs ($\\pi$ and $\\sigma$). The bond order is defined by\n$$\n\\text{bond order}=\\frac{N_{b}-N_{ab}}{2}.\n$$\nFor the 10-electron case, the occupied bonding orbitals are $\\sigma(2s)$ (2 e), $\\pi(2p)$ (4 e), and $\\sigma(2p)$ (2 e), totaling $N_{b}=8$, while $N_{ab}=2$ from $\\sigma^{\\ast}(2s)$. This yields\n$$\n\\text{bond order}=\\frac{8-2}{2}=3.\n$$\nTherefore, the simple MO electron count predicts the same bond order for both CO and BF, so option A, which asserts bond orders of 3 and 2 respectively, is not correct, and option D, which asserts a different number of bonding electrons, is not supported by the canonical filling.\n\nNext, we address how MO theory explains differences in bond strength for heteronuclear diatomics. In the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) treatment of a two-level interaction between atomic orbitals of energies $\\alpha_{A}$ and $\\alpha_{B}$ (on atoms $A$ and $B$) with resonance integral $\\beta$, the bonding and antibonding MO energies are\n$$\nE_{\\pm}=\\frac{\\alpha_{A}+\\alpha_{B}}{2}\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\beta^{2}},\\quad \\Delta=\\alpha_{A}-\\alpha_{B}.\n$$\nElectronegativity increases along the second period in the order $\\text{B}<\\text{C}<\\text{O}<\\text{F}$, and the energy of an atomic orbital decreases as electronegativity increases. Thus the AO energies satisfy\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{F}}<\\alpha_{\\text{O}}<\\alpha_{\\text{C}}<\\alpha_{\\text{B}},\n$$\nso the energy mismatch magnitude is smaller for the C/O pair than for the B/F pair:\n$$\n|\\Delta_{\\text{CO}}|=|\\alpha_{\\text{C}}-\\alpha_{\\text{O}}|<|\\Delta_{\\text{BF}}|=|\\alpha_{\\text{B}}-\\alpha_{\\text{F}}|.\n$$\nFrom the expression for $E_{\\pm}$, the degree of mixing and the stabilization of the bonding MO depend on both $\\beta$ (overlap/coupling) and the energy mismatch $|\\Delta|$. As $|\\Delta|$ increases, the MOs localize on the more electronegative atom, the mixing coefficients on the other atom diminish, and the bonding MO energy approaches the lower AO energy, resulting in reduced covalent stabilization relative to the separated-atom limit. In other words, a smaller $|\\Delta|$ yields stronger orbital mixing and a larger effective bondingâ€“antibonding splitting due to interaction, which stabilizes the bonding MOs more and strengthens the bond.\n\nApplying this to CO versus BF, the smaller AO energy gap between C and O leads to more effective mixing and greater stabilization of the bonding MOs than for B and F, consistent with the larger dissociation energy of CO. This is precisely the content of option C.\n\nWe briefly evaluate the remaining options. Option B appeals to polarity in a qualitative way but does not provide the correct MO-theoretic mechanism; polarity alone does not determine bond strength, whereas AO energy mismatch and mixing directly control bonding MO stabilization. Option E is incorrect: in CO the HOMO is a largely nonbonding $\\sigma$ lone pair centered on carbon rather than a bonding $\\pi$ orbital; for BF, the highest occupied orbitals are largely nonbonding fluorine lone pairs, but the claim contrasting a bonding $\\pi$ HOMO in CO with a nonbonding $\\sigma$ HOMO in BF mischaracterizes CO.\n\nTherefore, the MO-theory-based explanation that most directly and accurately accounts for the stronger CO bond is that the smaller AO energy difference in CO leads to more effective orbital mixing and greater stabilization of bonding MOs, which is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2004478"}]}
