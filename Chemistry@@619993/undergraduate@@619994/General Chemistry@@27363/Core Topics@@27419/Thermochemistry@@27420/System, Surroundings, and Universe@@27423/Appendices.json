The dissolution process is known to be endothermic, which is the principle behind instant cold packs. As the solid dissolves, the student observes a noticeable drop in the temperature of the resulting aqueous solution.\n\nFor the purpose of thermodynamic analysis, let us define the \"system\" as only the chemical substances undergoing the phase change and mixing, i.e., the dissolving ammonium nitrate. The \"surroundings\" therefore include the solvent (the water), the beaker, and the rest of the laboratory environment.\n\nLet $q_{sys}$ be the heat transferred to or from the system (the dissolving salt), and let $q_{water}$ be the heat transferred to or from the water that acts as the solvent.

The dissolution of ammonium nitrate is an endothermic process.\n2. The \"system\" is defined as the dissolving ammonium nitrate itself.\n\nLet's analyze the heat transfer for the system, $q_{sys}$.\nSince the dissolution process is defined as endothermic, it means the system must absorb heat from its surroundings to proceed. Heat is flowing *into* the system (the dissolving ammonium nitrate). Based on the sign convention, this means that the heat transfer for the system, $q_{sys}$, must be positive. Therefore, $q_{sys}  0$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the heat transfer for the water, $q_{water}$.\nThe water is defined as part of the surroundings. Specifically, it is the immediate part of the surroundings that is in direct thermal contact with the system. The heat that the system absorbs ($q_{sys}$) must be supplied by its surroundings. In this experimental setup, the primary source of this heat is the water in which the salt is dissolving. Consequently, the water must *lose* heat to the dissolving salt. Heat is flowing *out of* the water. Based on the sign convention, this means that the heat transfer for the water, $q_{water}$, must be negative. Therefore, $q_{water}  0$. This is consistent with the experimental observation that the temperature of the water drops.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, we find that $q_{sys}$ is positive and $q_{water}$ is negative.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA. $q_{sys}  0$ and $q_{water}  0$: This matches our analysis.\nB. $q_{sys}  0$ and $q_{water}  0$: This describes an exothermic dissolution process where the salt releases heat into the water.\nC. $q_{sys}  0$ and $q_{water}  0$: This would imply both the salt and the water are absorbing heat, which violates the principle of conservation of energy in this context, as there is no other specified source of heat.\nD. $q_{sys}  0$ and $q_{water}  0$: This would imply both are losing heat, which is also a violation of energy conservation.\nE. $q_{sys} = 0$ and $q_{water}  0$: This would mean the process is adiabatic for the salt, which contradicts the fact that it is an endothermic process.\n\nTherefore, the only correct description of the signs of heat transfer is that $q_{sys}$ is positive and $q_{water}$ is negative.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2020181"}, {"introduction": "The noticeable cooling of an aerosol can during use is a familiar yet profound thermodynamic event that can be explained by the first law.

This indicates that the temperature of the system decreases. For a condensed fluid and its vapor, the internal energy is strongly correlated with temperature, and evaporation within the can is endothermic. Therefore, the net change in internal energy of the system is negative:\n$$\n\\Delta E  0.\n$$\nWork: As propellant escapes and expands through the nozzle, the system exerts mechanical (expansion) work on the surroundings. With the stated sign convention, work done by the system implies\n$$\nw  0.\n$$\nHeat: Because the can becomes colder than its surroundings, heat flows spontaneously from the surroundings (hand and ambient air) into the system. Hence the heat transfer to the system is positive:\n$$\nq > 0.\n$$\nConsistency check with the first law: With $q>0$ and $w0$, the observed $\\Delta E0$ requires $q + w  0$, i.e., $|w| > q$, which is consistent with substantial expansion/phase-change cooling exceeding any concurrent heat gain from the surroundings during spraying.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is $\\Delta E  0, q > 0, w  0$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2020165"}, {"introduction": "Self-heating food and beverage containers offer a fascinating application of exothermic chemistry, but their operation is still governed by the strict laws of thermodynamics.
