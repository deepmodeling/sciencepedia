As we move across a period in the periodic table, elements gain protons and electrons, but how these electrons are added is key to their chemical character. This practice challenges you to compare the electron structures of two elements in the same period, reinforcing the principle that electrons are added to the outer valence shell while the inner core electron configuration remains unchanged.

Core electrons are those in the inner, completely filled electron shells, while valence electrons are in the outermost shell and are involved in chemical bonding.\n\nConsider a neutral sodium atom (Na), which has an atomic number of 11, and a neutral silicon atom (Si), which has an atomic number of 14. Both elements are located in Period 3 of the periodic table. Analyze how the number of core electrons compares between these two atoms. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The number of core electrons stays the same because electrons are added to the valence shell when moving across a period.\n\nB. The number of core electrons increases because the total number of electrons increases from sodium to silicon.\n\nC. The number of core electrons decreases because the increasing nuclear charge for silicon pulls the inner electrons into a smaller volume.\n\nD. The number of core electrons stays the same because both sodium and silicon are metals.", "solution": "Define core electrons as those occupying shells with principal quantum number lower than that of the valence shell; valence electrons occupy the highest $n$ shell in the ground state.\n\nFor neutral atoms, the total electron count equals the atomic number:\n$$N_{e^{-}}(\\text{Na})=11,\\quad N_{e^{-}}(\\text{Si})=14.$$\n\nBoth Na and Si are in Period 3, so the valence shell has $n=3$, and core electrons are those with $n<3$ (i.e., $n=1,2$).\n\nApply the aufbau principle to write ground-state configurations:\n- Sodium: $1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{1}$.

The answer lies in the concept of electron shielding and effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff}$). This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to quantify this difference using Slater's rules, a simplified but powerful model for estimating the shielding constant, $S$. By calculating and comparing the shielding experienced by a core electron versus a valence electron in the same atom, you will gain a concrete, numerical understanding of why they occupy vastly different energetic environments. [@problem_id:1986775]", "problem": "The concept of effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff}$) is a cornerstone in understanding periodic trends. It quantifies the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom. This effective charge is less than the full nuclear charge ($Z$) due to the repulsive forces from other electrons, an effect known as shielding. The shielding constant, $S$, represents the magnitude of this shielding effect, and the relationship is given by $Z_{eff} = Z - S$.\n\nThe shielding constant can be estimated using a set of empirical guidelines known as Slater's rules. For calculating the shielding experienced by an electron in an $s$ or $p$ orbital, the rules are as follows:\n\n1.  Write the electron configuration of the atom and group the orbitals in the following sequence:\n    $(1s)$, $(2s, 2p)$, $(3s, 3p)$, $(3d)$, $(4s, 4p)$, $(4d)$, etc.\n\n2.  For a specific electron of interest, electrons in any group to the right of its group contribute nothing to the shielding constant $S$.\n\n3.  All other electrons in the same group as the electron of interest contribute $0.35$ each to $S$. (A special case exists for the $(1s)$ group where the other electron contributes $0.30$, but this is not relevant for electrons in higher shells).\n\n4.  For an electron in an $(ns, np)$ group, all electrons in the $(n-1)$ shell contribute $0.85$ each to $S$.\n\n5.  For an electron in an $(ns, np)$ group, all electrons in shells $(n-2)$ or lower contribute $1.00$ each to $S$.\n\nConsider a neutral sulfur atom in its ground state, which has an atomic number $Z = 16$. Calculate the ratio of the shielding constant experienced by a single valence $3p$ electron, denoted as $S_{3p}$, to the shielding constant experienced by a single core $2p$ electron, denoted as $S_{2p}$.\n\nDetermine the numerical value of the ratio $S_{3p} / S_{2p}$.
