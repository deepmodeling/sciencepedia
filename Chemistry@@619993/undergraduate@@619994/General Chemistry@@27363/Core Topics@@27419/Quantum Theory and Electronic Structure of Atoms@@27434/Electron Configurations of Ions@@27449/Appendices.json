To do this, we need the atomic number (Z), which represents the number of protons and also the number of electrons in a neutral atom.\n1.  For Arsenic (As), the atomic number is $Z=33$. The ion is $As^{3-}$, which indicates that the neutral atom has gained 3 electrons.\n    Number of electrons in $As^{3-} = 33 + 3 = 36$ electrons.\n2.  For Strontium (Sr), the atomic number is $Z=38$. The ion is $Sr^{2+}$, which indicates that the neutral atom has lost 2 electrons.\n    Number of electrons in $Sr^{2+} = 38 - 2 = 36$ electrons.\n3.  For Yttrium (Y), the atomic number is $Z=39$. The ion is $Y^{3+}$, which indicates that the neutral atom has lost 3 electrons.\n    Number of electrons in $Y^{3+} = 39 - 3 = 36$ electrons.\n\nSince all three ions have 36 electrons, they form an isoelectronic series. We now identify the noble gas that has 36 electrons. The noble gases have atomic numbers 2 (He), 10 (Ne), 18 (Ar), 36 (Kr), 54 (Xe), etc. The noble gas with 36 electrons is Krypton (Kr). Therefore, the common noble gas electron configuration for this isoelectronic series is [Kr].\nThis eliminates option A (which suggests [Ar]) and option D (which suggests [Xe]). We are left with options B, C, and E.\n\nNext, we must determine the order of the ionic radii. For an isoelectronic series, all species have the same number of electrons and electron shells. The size of the ion is therefore primarily determined by the nuclear charge, which is the number of protons (Z). A larger nuclear charge results in a stronger electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electrons, pulling the electron cloud closer to the nucleus and making the ion smaller.\n\nLet's compare the nuclear charges of the three ions:\n-   $As^{3-}$ has a nuclear charge of Z = 33 protons.\n-   $Sr^{2+}$ has a nuclear charge of Z = 38 protons.\n-   $Y^{3+}$ has a nuclear charge of Z = 39 protons.\n\nThe order of increasing nuclear charge is As < Sr < Y.\nSince a higher nuclear charge leads to a smaller ionic radius, the order of increasing ionic radius will be the reverse of the order of nuclear charge: $Y^{3+}  Sr^{2+}  As^{3-}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the order of *decreasing* ionic radius (from largest to smallest). This order is:\n$As^{3-} > Sr^{2+} > Y^{3+}$\n\nNow we combine our two findings:\n-   Common noble gas configuration: [Kr]\n-   Order of decreasing ionic radius: $As^{3-} > Sr^{2+} > Y^{3+}$\n\nWe look for the option that matches both of these results.\n-   Option B: Configuration: [Kr]; Order of decreasing radius: $Y^{3+} > Sr^{2+} > As^{3-}$ (Incorrect order)\n-   Option C: Configuration: [Kr]; Order of decreasing radius: $As^{3-} > Sr^{2+} > Y^{3+}$ (Correct order)\n-   Option E: Configuration: [Kr]; Order of decreasing radius: $Sr^{2+} > Y^{3+} > As^{3-}$ (Incorrect order)\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1991957"}]}
