This principle is best understood by starting with the simplest case: two electrons sharing a single atomic orbital. This exercise challenges you to apply the rules of quantum numbers to identify the only valid description for two electrons co-habiting a $2s$ orbital, reinforcing the crucial concept that they must have opposite spins. [@problem_id:1992170]", "problem": "The state of an electron in an atom is described by a set of four quantum numbers: the principal quantum number ($n$), the angular momentum quantum number ($l$), the magnetic quantum number ($m_l$), and the spin magnetic quantum number ($m_s$). These numbers must obey specific rules: $n$ can be any positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...); for a given $n$, $l$ can range from 0 to $n-1$; for a given $l$, $m_l$ can range from $-l$ to $+l$ in integer steps; and $m_s$ can be either $+1/2$ or $-1/2$.\n\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. This implies that if two electrons occupy the same atomic orbital, they must have different spin quantum numbers.\n\nAn atomic orbital is defined by the values of $n$, $l$, and $m_l$. The designation for an orbital (e.g., $1s, 2p, 3d$) corresponds to specific values of $n$ and $l$.\n\nGiven the sets of quantum numbers below, represented in the format $(n, l, m_l, m_s)$, identify the only option that presents a valid pair of quantum number sets for two electrons co-occupying a single $2s$ atomic orbital.\n\nA. $(2, 0, 0, +1/2)$ and $(2, 0, 0, +1/2)$\n\nB. $(2, 1, 0, +1/2)$ and $(2, 1, 0, -1/2)$\n\nC. $(2, 0, 0, +1/2)$ and $(2, 0, 0, -1/2)$\n\nD. $(1, 0, 0, +1/2)$ and $(2, 0, 0, -1/2)$\n\nE. $(2, 0, -1, +1/2)$ and $(2, 0, -1, -1/2)$", "solution": "An atomic orbital is specified by the triple $(n,l,m_l)$. For a $2s$ orbital, the required quantum numbers are $n=2$, $l=0$ (since $s \\leftrightarrow l=0$), and for $l=0$ the only allowed magnetic quantum number is $m_l=0$. Thus any electron in the $2s$ orbital must have $(n,l,m_l)=(2,0,0)$. Two electrons can co-occupy this orbital only if they have opposite spins due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, i.e., one with $m_s=+\\frac{1}{2}$ and the other with $m_s=-\\frac{1}{2}$, while sharing the same $(n,l,m_l)$.\n\nNow evaluate each option against these rules:\n\nOption A: $(2,0,0,+\\frac{1}{2})$ and $(2,0,0,+\\frac{1}{2})$.
