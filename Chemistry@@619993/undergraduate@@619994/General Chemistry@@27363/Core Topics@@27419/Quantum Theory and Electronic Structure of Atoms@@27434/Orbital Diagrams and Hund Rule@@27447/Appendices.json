Instead of predicting a configuration from an element, you will deduce an element's identity from descriptive information about its electronic structure.

For a neutral atom, the electron count equals $Z$, hence $Z=7$.\n\nThe ground-state electron configuration is built by the Aufbau principle, filling lower-energy orbitals first, subject to the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rule. The statement that two electrons are in the principal level $n=1$ implies the $1s$ subshell is filled:\n$$1s^{2}.$$\nThis accounts for $2$ electrons. The remaining $7-2=5$ electrons are in the $n=2$ level. Within $n=2$, the available subshells are $2s$ with orbital quantum number $l=0$ (spherical) and $2p$ with $l=1$. The statement that two electrons occupy a spherical subshell at $n=2$ identifies the $2s$ subshell, so\n$$2s^{2}.$$\nThis uses $2$ of the $5$ electrons in $n=2$, leaving $3$ electrons to occupy the next higher-energy subshell, which is $2p$. Thus we have\n$$2p^{3}.$$\n\nHund's rule states that for degenerate orbitals (the three $2p$ orbitals with magnetic quantum numbers $m_{l}=-1,0,1$), electrons occupy different orbitals with parallel spins to maximize total spin. Therefore, the three $2p$ electrons each have the same spin quantum number $m_{s}$ and are unpaired, exactly as observed.\n\nCollecting these, the ground-state configuration is\n$$1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{3},$$\nwhich corresponds to the element nitrogen, whose symbol is N and which has $Z=7$.

By comparing a neutral transition metal atom with its ion, you can directly apply the rules for electron removal and see how it impacts the number of unpaired electrons. This exercise [@problem_id:1320733] is particularly insightful as it demonstrates that the number of unpaired electrons, and thus the magnetic character, may not change in the way one might initially expect.", "problem": "The specific arrangement of electrons in an atom's orbitals governs many of its chemical and physical properties, such as magnetism. For transition metals, the filling of the d-orbitals is particularly important. Consider a neutral, isolated iron atom (Fe) and its common doubly-charged cation, the ferrous ion (Fe²⁺).

The $3d$ subshell has five degenerate orbitals. By Hund's rule, electrons first singly occupy each of the five $d$ orbitals with parallel spins, and only then begin to pair. For $3d^{6}$, the first five electrons singly occupy the five $d$ orbitals (5 unpaired), and the sixth electron pairs in one of those orbitals, yielding $5-1=4$ unpaired electrons. Therefore, neutral $\\mathrm{Fe}$ has $4$ unpaired electrons.\n\nFor the ferrous ion $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, two electrons are removed upon ionization.
