The compound is a white crystalline solid that is readily soluble in deionized water. The student prepares an aqueous solution of this unknown solid and divides it into three portions to perform a series of qualitative analysis tests. The observations are as follows:\n\n1.  To the first portion of the solution, an aqueous solution of sodium sulfate ($Na_2SO_4$) is added. The addition results in the formation of a dense white precipitate.\n2.  To a fresh, second portion of the solution, an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$) is added. No observable change occurs; the solution remains clear and colorless.\n3.  To the third portion of the solution, an aqueous solution of potassium chromate ($K_2CrO_4$) is added. This results in the immediate formation of a bright yellow precipitate.\n\nBased on these observations, which one of the following compounds is the most likely identity of the unknown white solid?\n\nA. Calcium Nitrate, $Ca(NO_3)_2$\n\nB. Strontium Chloride, $SrCl_2$\n\nC. Barium Nitrate, $Ba(NO_3)_2$\n\nD. Lead(II) Acetate, $Pb(CH_3COO)_2$\n\nE. Silver Nitrate, $AgNO_3$", "solution": "We interpret each observation using qualitative inorganic analysis and solubility rules, then intersect the deductions.\n\nFirst test (addition of sulfate): A dense white precipitate forms upon adding $Na_{2}SO_{4}$. This indicates the cation $M^{n+}$ forms an insoluble sulfate:\n$$M^{2+} + SO_{4}^{2-} \\to MSO_{4}(s).$$\nAmong the given options, $Ba^{2+}$, $Sr^{2+}$, and $Pb^{2+}$ form very insoluble white sulfates ($BaSO_{4}$, $SrSO_{4}$, $PbSO_{4}$). $CaSO_{4}$ is only sparingly soluble and often gives at most slight turbidity rather than a dense precipitate, and $Ag_{2}SO_{4}$ is only moderately soluble and is less characteristic. Thus the observation strongly supports $Ba^{2+}$, $Sr^{2+}$, or $Pb^{2+}$.\n\nSecond test (addition of hydroxide): No observable change upon adding $NaOH$ means no hydroxide precipitate forms:\n$$M^{2+} + 2OH^{-} \\to M(OH)_{2}(s) \\quad \\text{does not occur.}$$\n$Pb^{2+}$ would give $Pb(OH)_{2}(s)$ (which may dissolve in excess base, but a precipitate forms initially), and $Ag^{+}$ gives $Ag_{2}O(s)$ via $AgOH$ instability; both contradict the observation. $Ca^{2+}$ typically yields $Ca(OH)_{2}(s)$ under added $OH^{-}$. In contrast, $Ba(OH)_{2}$ and $Sr(OH)_{2}$ are sufficiently soluble that no precipitate appears. Therefore, this test eliminates $Pb^{2+}$, $Ag^{+}$, and $Ca^{2+}$, leaving $Ba^{2+}$ or $Sr^{2+}$.\n\nThird test (addition of chromate): A bright yellow precipitate forms with $K_{2}CrO_{4}$:\n$$M^{2+} + CrO_{4}^{2-} \\to MCrO_{4}(s).$$\n$BaCrO_{4}$ is a characteristically yellow, insoluble precipitate that forms readily. $SrCrO_{4}$ is much more soluble and typically does not precipitate immediately under comparable conditions. $PbCrO_{4}$ is also bright yellow but $Pb^{2+}$ was eliminated by the hydroxide test. $Ag_{2}CrO_{4}$ is red-brown, not bright yellow. Thus the chromate test specifically points to $Ba^{2+}$.\n\nAll three observations are simultaneously and most strongly consistent with $Ba^{2+}$ as the cation. The given white, water-soluble nitrate salt of barium matches $Ba(NO_{3})_{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the unknown is Barium Nitrate, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2014459"}, {"introduction": "While simple precipitation is a powerful tool, it sometimes falls short when dealing with families of chemically similar ions, such as the halides ($F^{-}$, $Cl^{-}$, $Br^{-}$, and $I^{-}$). This next challenge demonstrates how to overcome this by employing more sophisticated techniques [@problem_id:2014473]. You will interpret results from both selective precipitation and a halogen displacement test, which leverages differences in redox potential and solubility in an organic solvent to create an unmistakable \"fingerprint\" for each ion present.", "problem": "A chemistry student is given an aqueous solution, labeled \"Solution X,\" which is known to contain one or more sodium halide salts (NaF, NaCl, NaBr, and/or NaI). To identify the halide(s) present, the student performs two separate tests.\n\n**Test 1:** A small sample of Solution X is acidified with several drops of dilute nitric acid. Subsequently, an aqueous solution of silver nitrate is added, resulting in the formation of a pale yellow precipitate. This precipitate is collected and washed, and it is found to be completely insoluble when treated with concentrated aqueous ammonia.\n\n**Test 2:** A fresh sample of Solution X is placed in a test tube with a small volume of an immiscible, nonpolar organic solvent (mineral oil). A dilute solution of chlorine in water (chlorine water) is then added drop by drop, with the test tube being shaken vigorously after each small addition. The following sequence of color changes is observed in the organic layer:\n- **Part A:** With the initial additions of chlorine water, the organic layer develops a deep violet color.\n- **Part B:** As more chlorine water is added, the violet color fades completely and is replaced by a reddish-brown color.\n- **Part C:** Upon the addition of a large excess of chlorine water, the reddish-brown color also fades, leaving the organic layer colorless.\n\nBased on the results of both tests, which of the following conclusions about the composition of Solution X is correct?\n\nA. The solution contains only iodide ions.\n\nB. The solution contains only bromide ions.\n\nC. The solution contains chloride and bromide ions.\n\nD. The solution contains bromide and iodide ions.\n\nE. The solution contains chloride, bromide, and iodide ions.", "solution": "We analyze each test by explicitly invoking the underlying chemical principles, writing the key reactions, and aligning the observed colors and solubility with the possible ions.\n\nTest 1 uses the classical silver nitrate test after acidifying with nitric acid to suppress interferences (e.g., carbonates). The relevant principles are:\n- Precipitation of sparingly soluble silver halides: Ag^{+} reacts with halide X^{-} to form AgX(s), where X^{-} is Cl^{-}, Br^{-}, or I^{-}.\n- Relative solubilities and complex formation with ammonia: AgCl dissolves in dilute NH3 via formation of the ammine complex, AgBr dissolves in concentrated NH3, while AgI is insoluble even in concentrated NH3. The complex-formation equilibrium may be represented as AgX(s) + 2 NH3(aq) -> [Ag(NH3)2]^{+}(aq) + X^{-}(aq) for X = Cl^{-}, Br^{-} (but not effectively for X = I^{-}). The solubility order is $K_{sp}(\\text{AgCl}) > K_{sp}(\\text{AgBr}) > K_{sp}(\\text{AgI})$, so AgI is the least soluble.\n- Observations: A pale yellow precipitate forms upon adding AgNO3 and remains completely insoluble in concentrated aqueous NH3. Insolubility in concentrated NH3 requires the presence of AgI, hence I^{-} is present. A pale yellow hue is more typical of AgBr (cream/pale yellow) whereas AgI is yellow; thus the color suggests that Br^{-} could also be present, but the decisive ammonia test identifies I^{-}. From Test 1 alone, the certain conclusion is that I^{-} is present; Br^{-} cannot be excluded, and Cl^{-} is not indicated because AgCl would dissolve in ammonia.\n\nTest 2 uses halogen displacement with partition into a nonpolar organic layer (mineral oil). The controlling redox principle is the relative oxidizing power of the halogens in water: Cl2 oxidizes I^{-} and Br^{-}, with standard reactions:\n- Cl2(aq) + 2 I^{-}(aq) -> 2 Cl^{-}(aq) + I2(aq)\n- Cl2(aq) + 2 Br^{-}(aq) -> 2 Cl^{-}(aq) + Br2(aq)\nThe colors in the organic (nonpolar) layer arise from preferential partitioning of the nonpolar halogens: I2 gives a deep violet color; Br2 gives a reddish-brown color. In the presence of excess chlorine water, these diatomic halogens are further oxidized in aqueous medium to colorless oxyanions (under sufficiently oxidizing, acidic conditions), e.g., iodine to iodate and bromine to bromate (representative overall redox forms include $I_2 + 5 Cl_2 + 6 H_2O \\to 2 IO_3^{-} + 10 Cl^{-} + 12 H^{+}$ and $Br_2 + 5 Cl_2 + 6 H_2O \\to 2 BrO_3^{-} + 10 Cl^{-} + 12 H^{+}$), which removes color from the organic layer as the elemental halogens are consumed.\n\nWe now match each observed part:\n- Part A (initial deep violet in organic layer): This requires formation of I2, so I^{-} must be present because Cl2 oxidizes I^{-} to I2, which partitions into the organic phase giving violet.\n- Part B (violet fades and is replaced by reddish-brown): As more Cl2 is added, bromide, if present, is oxidized to Br2, which partitions into the organic layer giving a reddish-brown color. Simultaneously, the initially formed I2 is further consumed by oxidation in the aqueous phase (to colorless oxyanions) and/or overwhelmed in color by Br2, so the violet fades. Therefore, the appearance of a persistent reddish-brown color after the violet phase indicates Br^{-} is present.\n- Part C (with a large excess of chlorine water the organic layer becomes colorless): In strong excess of Cl2, both I2 and Br2 are further oxidized in water to colorless oxyanions (iodate and bromate), leaving no elemental halogen to color the organic layer. This is consistent with the sequential oxidation of first I^{-} and then Br^{-} by Cl2.\n\nCombining both tests:\n- Test 1 proves I^{-} is present (insoluble AgI in concentrated NH3). The pale yellow appearance is compatible with either AgI viewed as pale or a mixture containing some AgBr; crucially, the insolubility in concentrated NH3 rules out a precipitate composed solely of AgCl or AgBr.\n- Test 2 requires both I^{-} (violet I2 phase) and Br^{-} (later reddish-brown Br2 phase). Chloride, if present, would neither produce a colored halogen in the organic layer with chlorine water nor survive the qualitative silver test without at least partial dissolution of AgCl in ammonia; the observations do not require chloride and are most simply explained without it.\n\nThus, the composition that satisfies both tests is that Solution X contains bromide and iodide ions and does not require chloride. This corresponds to option D.\n\nChecking the alternatives:\n- A (only I^{-}) fails to explain the distinct reddish-brown phase attributable to Br2.\n- B (only Br^{-}) fails to explain the initial violet phase attributable to I2.\n- C (Cl^{-} and Br^{-}) fails to explain the initial violet attributable to I2 and is inconsistent with the ammonia insolubility that points to I^{-}.\n- E (Cl^{-}, Br^{-}, I^{-}) is not required by any observation and is disfavored by the ammonia insolubility description; the simplest and fully consistent conclusion is Br^{-} and I^{-} only.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is bromide and iodide ions are present.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2014473"}, {"introduction": "What happens when the compound you need to analyze is considered \"insoluble\" in most reagents?
