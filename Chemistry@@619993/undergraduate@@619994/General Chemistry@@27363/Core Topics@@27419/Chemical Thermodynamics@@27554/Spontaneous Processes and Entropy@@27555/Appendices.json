This practice explores this core idea by comparing two allotropes of carbon: diamond and graphite. By analyzing how their distinct crystal structures either constrain or permit atomic vibrations and motions, we can develop a strong physical intuition for why one substance has a higher entropy than another, a concept central to materials science and thermodynamics. [@problem_id:2017232]", "problem": "Carbon can exist in different stable structural forms known as allotropes. Two of the most common and well-studied allotropes are diamond and graphite. The crystal structure of diamond consists of carbon atoms arranged in a rigid, three-dimensional lattice where each atom is covalently bonded to four others in a tetrahedral geometry. This creates a single, giant molecule with a very strong and tightly-held network. In contrast, the structure of graphite consists of two-dimensional planes of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Within each plane, the atoms are strongly covalently bonded, but the planes themselves are stacked and held together by much weaker intermolecular forces.\n\nBased solely on this information about their respective crystal structures, evaluate the standard molar entropies ($S^\\circ$) of diamond and graphite at 298 K. Select the statement that correctly predicts the relationship and provides the most accurate physical reasoning.\n\nA. Diamond has a higher standard molar entropy than graphite because its three-dimensional covalent network allows for more complex vibrational modes than the planar structure of graphite.\n\nB. Graphite and diamond have virtually identical standard molar entropies because they are both solids composed of the same element, carbon, under the same conditions.\n\nC. Graphite has a higher standard molar entropy than diamond because the weak bonding between its planar layers allows for additional vibrational and translational motions not present in diamond's rigid lattice.\n\nD. Diamond has a higher standard molar entropy than graphite because the conversion of graphite to diamond is an endothermic process, and higher enthalpy always implies higher entropy.\n\nE. Graphite has a higher standard molar entropy than diamond because it is the thermodynamically more stable allotrope of carbon at 298 K and 1 atm, and stability is directly proportional to entropy.", "solution": "The problem asks us to compare the standard molar entropies ($S^\\circ$) of diamond and graphite at 298 K based on their crystal structures. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system, which, from a statistical mechanics perspective, corresponds to the number of accessible microstates a system can occupy. For a crystalline solid, the primary contribution to entropy comes from the vibrational motions of the atoms within the crystal lattice.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each allotrope in the context of atomic motion.\n\nFirst, consider diamond. Its structure is a three-dimensional covalent network. Every carbon atom is tightly held in place by four strong, directional covalent bonds forming a rigid, tetrahedral lattice. The movement of each atom is highly constrained; it can only vibrate about its fixed equilibrium position in the lattice. The strong bonding throughout the entire crystal limits the amplitude and variety of these vibrations. This high degree of order and restricted motion means that the number of accessible microstates for diamond is relatively low.\n\nNext, consider graphite. Its structure is composed of stacked two-dimensional sheets. Within each sheet, carbon atoms are strongly bonded in a hexagonal arrangement. However, the forces holding these sheets together are weak van der Waals forces. This structural feature has a critical consequence for entropy. In addition to the vibrations of atoms within each sheet (intralayer vibrations), the sheets themselves can vibrate and even slide relative to one another (interlayer motions). This extra degree of freedom—the motion of entire planes relative to each other—is not available in the rigid, interlocked structure of diamond. These additional modes of motion dramatically increase the number of possible arrangements and energy distributions (microstates) available to the graphite system.\n\nTherefore, because the atoms and layers in graphite have more freedom of movement compared to the rigidly constrained atoms in diamond, graphite has a greater number of accessible microstates. A greater number of microstates corresponds to a higher entropy. We conclude that the standard molar entropy of graphite is higher than that of diamond ($S^\\circ_{\\text{graphite}} > S^\\circ_{\\text{diamond}}$).\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This is incorrect. While diamond has a 3D network, its rigidity severely restricts motion. The planarity of graphite, combined with weak interlayer forces, allows for *more* varied motion, not less.\nB. This is incorrect. It ignores the fundamental principle that entropy is highly dependent on structure (arrangement of atoms), not just composition and state of matter. Allotropes of the same element in the same phase can have very different entropies.\nC. This is the correct statement. It accurately identifies that the weak interlayer bonding in graphite allows for additional modes of motion (vibrational and translational freedom of the layers) that are absent in the rigid diamond lattice, leading to a higher entropy.\nD. This option incorrectly links enthalpy and entropy. While there are thermodynamic relationships between them (e.g., Gibbs free energy), one does not directly determine the other in this simple manner. The conversion of graphite to diamond is indeed endothermic ($\\Delta H > 0$), but this fact alone does not dictate which substance has higher intrinsic entropy.\nE. This statement contains a flaw in its reasoning. While graphite is indeed the more thermodynamically stable allotrope at 298 K and 1 atm (meaning its Gibbs free energy of formation is lower), thermodynamic stability is determined by a balance of both enthalpy and entropy ($\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$). A substance can be more stable because it has a much lower enthalpy, even if it has a lower entropy. In this case, graphite's stability is due to a combination of factors, and one cannot simply equate stability with higher entropy.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C provides the correct prediction and the correct physical justification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2017232"}, {"introduction": "Having built a qualitative feel for entropy, let's now quantify it.

Since the device is isolated and the gas is ideal, the internal energy $U$ depends only on temperature $T$.
