The convention is that a more negative $E_{ea}$ indicates a more favorable process (more energy is released). The general periodic trend is for electron affinity to become more negative (more exothermic) moving from left to right across a period. However, there are notable exceptions. For the first 20 elements, Beryllium (Be, atomic number 4) and Nitrogen (N, atomic number 7) have electron affinity values that are positive or close to zero, indicating that the formation of their respective negative ions, $\\text{Be}^{-}$ and $\\text{N}^{-}$, is energetically unfavorable.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for the anomalously low electron affinities of both Beryllium and Nitrogen?\n\nA. Both Beryllium and Nitrogen have very high electronegativity compared to other elements in their respective periods, which paradoxically repels an incoming electron.\n\nB. The atomic radii of both Beryllium and Nitrogen are unusually large, causing the incoming electron to experience a very weak effective nuclear charge.\n\nC. Beryllium has a completely filled $2s$ subshell, and Nitrogen has a half-filled $2p$ subshell. In both cases, the incoming electron must enter a new subshell or pair up in an already occupied orbital, which is energetically unfavorable due to electronic stability and electron-electron repulsion.\n\nD. Both Beryllium and Nitrogen have exceptionally high first ionization energies. Since it is difficult to remove an electron, it is also difficult to add one, making the electron affinity unfavorable.\n\nE. The low electron affinity of Beryllium is due to its metallic character, while the low electron affinity of Nitrogen is due to it being a diatomic gas, $\\text{N}_2$, under standard conditions.", "solution": "Define the sign convention for electron affinity as the energy change for the process $A(g)+e^{-}\\to A^{-}(g)$, with $E_{ea}<0$ indicating an exothermic (favorable) process under the convention given. Across a period, $E_{ea}$ generally becomes more negative due to increasing effective nuclear charge, but subshell structure and electron-electron interactions can produce exceptions.\n\nFor Beryllium, the ground-state electron configuration is $1s^{2}2s^{2}$. This has a closed $2s$ subshell, which is electronically stable. An incoming electron cannot enter the already filled $2s$ subshell and must occupy a $2p$ orbital, which lies higher in energy than $2s$, i.e., $E(2p)>E(2s)$, due to reduced penetration and greater shielding. Thus, the neutral Be atom enjoys closed-subshell stability, while formation of $\\text{Be}^{-}$ requires population of a new, higher-energy subshell. The gain in electron-nucleus attraction upon adding the electron to a $2p$ orbital is offset by the energetic cost associated with occupying this higher subshell and the loss of closed-subshell stability, making $E_{ea}$ small in magnitude and often positive (unfavorable) under the stated convention.\n\nFor Nitrogen, the ground-state configuration is $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{3}$, which is a half-filled $2p$ subshell. By Hund’s rule, this maximizes spin multiplicity and exchange stabilization, lowering the energy of the neutral atom. Adding an electron produces $2p^{4}$, which forces pairing in one of the $2p$ orbitals. This introduces additional interelectronic repulsion (pairing energy) and reduces exchange stabilization, both of which raise the energy of the anion relative to the neutral atom. Consequently, the energy released upon electron addition is small or insufficient to overcome these penalties, yielding an $E_{ea}$ that is near zero or positive under the given sign convention.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because electronegativity reflects an atom’s tendency to attract electrons in bonds and does not cause a “repulsion” of an incoming electron; moreover, Be does not have high electronegativity. This does not address subshell stability or pairing.\n- B is incorrect because Be and N do not have unusually large atomic radii within Period 2; the anomaly arises from subshell filling and electron-electron interactions, not an anomalously weak effective nuclear charge.\n- C is correct: Be has a filled $2s$ subshell, so the added electron must enter a higher-energy $2p$ subshell; N has a half-filled $2p$ subshell, so the added electron must pair in an already occupied orbital. In both cases, electronic stability (closed or half-filled subshells) and electron-electron repulsion make the process energetically unfavorable.\n- D is incorrect: first ionization energy and electron affinity are distinct properties; a high ionization energy does not imply a low (unfavorable) electron affinity. The anomalies are specifically due to subshell filling and pairing effects.\n- E is incorrect: electron affinity is an atomic property; invoking the diatomic nature of $\\text{N}_{2}$ in the standard state is irrelevant. Likewise, “metallic character” alone does not explain Be’s anomaly; the correct rationale is the filled $2s$ subshell and resulting subshell-occupation requirement for the added electron.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is the subshell stability and pairing argument given in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2278736"}, {"introduction": "The interplay between nuclear charge, atomic size, and electron-electron repulsion creates fascinating nuances in periodic trends.

It is formally defined as the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a neutral atom in the gaseous state to form a negative ion.

While general periodic trends provide a useful guide, specific electronic configurations can lead to important exceptions. Analyze the interplay between effective nuclear charge, atomic size, and electron-electron repulsion for these three elements.\n\nBased on these principles, which of the following options correctly arranges the elements in order of **increasing** electron affinity (from least exothermic to most exothermic)?\n\nA. O < F < S\n\nB. S < O < F\n\nC. O < S < F\n\nD. F < O < S\n\nE. S < F < O", "solution": "The problem asks to arrange oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and sulfur (S) in order of increasing electron affinity. Increasing electron affinity corresponds to a more negative (more exothermic) energy change for the process $X(g) + e^{-} \\rightarrow X^{-}(g)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the general periodic trends for electron affinity.\n1.  **Across a period (from left to right):** Electron affinity generally becomes more exothermic. This is because the effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$) increases, while the atomic radius decreases. A stronger pull from the nucleus on the outermost electrons leads to a greater energy release when an electron is added.\n2.  **Down a group:** Electron affinity generally becomes less exothermic. This is because the incoming electron is added to a principal energy level that is farther from the nucleus. The increased distance and greater shielding from core electrons reduce the attraction of the nucleus for the new electron.\n\nNow, let's apply these trends and consider the specific electronic structures of O, F, and S.\n\n**Step 1: Compare Oxygen (O) and Fluorine (F)**\nOxygen (atomic number 8) and Fluorine (atomic number 9) are in the same period (period 2). The electron configuration of oxygen is $[He] 2s^2 2p^4$, and for fluorine, it is $[He] 2s^2 2p^5$.\nFollowing the trend across a period, fluorine is to the right of oxygen. Fluorine has a higher effective nuclear charge than oxygen. Adding an electron to fluorine completes its 2p subshell, resulting in a stable noble gas configuration for the $F^{-}$ ion ($[He] 2s^2 2p^6$). This is a highly favorable process. Therefore, fluorine has a significantly more exothermic electron affinity than oxygen.\nSo far, we have: O < F.\n\n**Step 2: Compare Oxygen (O) and Sulfur (S)**\nOxygen and Sulfur (atomic number 16) are in the same group (Group 16). Oxygen is in period 2, and sulfur is in period 3. The electron configuration of sulfur is $[Ne] 3s^2 3p^4$.\nAccording to the general trend down a group, electron affinity should become less exothermic. This would suggest that oxygen has a more exothermic electron affinity than sulfur (EA(O) > EA(S)). However, this is a well-known exception to the trend.\n\nThe reason for this exception lies in the electron density of the valence shell. Oxygen is a very small atom with its valence electrons in the 2p orbitals. The addition of an extra electron into the already partially filled and compact 2p subshell leads to significant electron-electron repulsion. This repulsion destabilizes the resulting $O^{-}$ ion, making the process less exothermic than it would otherwise be.\n\nSulfur is a larger atom with its valence electrons in the more diffuse 3p orbitals. The incoming electron enters the 3p subshell. Because the 3p orbitals are larger than the 2p orbitals, the existing valence electrons are more spread out. This results in significantly less electron-electron repulsion when the new electron is added compared to the case of oxygen. The effect of reduced electron-electron repulsion in sulfur is strong enough to outweigh the fact that the electron is being added to a higher energy level (n=3 vs n=2). Consequently, the electron affinity of sulfur is more exothermic than that of oxygen.\nSo, we have the order: O < S.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the complete order**\nFrom Step 1, we know O < F.\nFrom Step 2, we know O < S. This makes oxygen the element with the least exothermic electron affinity.\nNow we need to compare sulfur and fluorine.\nFluorine is in period 2, and sulfur is in period 3. Fluorine is in Group 17, while sulfur is in Group 16. Fluorine's position at the top-right of this group of elements (excluding noble gases) suggests it will have a very high electron affinity. Its high effective nuclear charge and the immense stability gained by achieving a noble gas configuration upon accepting an electron make its electron affinity the most exothermic of the three. Even though sulfur has a more exothermic EA than oxygen, the factors making fluorine's EA so high are dominant.\nActual experimental values confirm this:\nEA(O) = -141 kJ/mol\nEA(S) = -200 kJ/mol\nEA(F) = -328 kJ/mol\n\nThe order of increasing electron affinity (from least exothermic to most exothermic) is Oxygen < Sulfur < Fluorine.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct option**\nThe derived order is O < S < F.
