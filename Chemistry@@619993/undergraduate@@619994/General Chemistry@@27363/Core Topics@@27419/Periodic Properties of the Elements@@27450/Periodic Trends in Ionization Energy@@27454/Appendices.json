It represents the minimum energy required to remove the outermost electron from a neutral atom in its gaseous state. A researcher is evaluating a set of elements from the second period of the periodic table for a new plasma-based deposition process. The elements under consideration are Beryllium (Be), Boron (B), Nitrogen (N), Oxygen (O), and Fluorine (F). To predict the behavior of these elements in a high-energy environment, it is necessary to rank them according to their first ionization energy.\n\nBased on fundamental principles of atomic structure and periodic trends, arrange these five elements in order of decreasing first ionization energy.

Be > B > O > N > F", "solution": "The problem asks us to arrange five second-period elements—Beryllium (Be), Boron (B), Nitrogen (N), Oxygen (O), and Fluorine (F)—in order of decreasing first ionization energy.\n\nFirst, let's recall the general periodic trend for first ionization energy. As we move from left to right across a period, the first ionization energy generally increases. This is because the atomic number increases, leading to a greater number of protons in the nucleus. This stronger positive charge, or effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$), pulls the valence electrons more tightly, making them more difficult to remove. Based on this general trend alone, we would predict the order to be F > O > N > C > B > Be.\n\nHowever, there are important exceptions to this trend that arise from electron configurations and subshell stability. We must examine the electron configurations of the given elements:\n- Beryllium (Be, Z=4): $[\\text{He}] 2s^2$\n- Boron (B, Z=5): $[\\text{He}] 2s^2 2p^1$\n- Nitrogen (N, Z=7): $[\\text{He}] 2s^2 2p^3$\n- Oxygen (O, Z=8): $[\\text{He}] 2s^2 2p^4$\n- Fluorine (F, Z=9): $[\\text{He}] 2s^2 2p^5$\n\nNow, let's analyze the two key anomalies in this period.\n\n1.  **Comparison between Beryllium (Be) and Boron (B):**\n    According to the general trend, Boron should have a higher ionization energy than Beryllium. However, Beryllium has a completely filled $2s$ subshell ($2s^2$), which is a relatively stable electron configuration. The outermost electron in Boron is in the $2p$ subshell ($2p^1$). This $2p$ electron is at a slightly higher energy level than the $2s$ electrons and is also shielded from the nucleus by the $2s$ electrons. Removing this lone, higher-energy $2p$ electron from Boron requires less energy than removing a paired electron from the stable, filled $2s$ subshell of Beryllium. Therefore, the first ionization energy of Beryllium is greater than that of Boron. We have the order: Be > B.\n\n2.  **Comparison between Nitrogen (N) and Oxygen (O):**\n    Following the general trend, Oxygen should have a higher ionization energy than Nitrogen. However, Nitrogen has a half-filled $2p$ subshell ($2p^3$), where each of the three $p$ orbitals contains exactly one electron with a parallel spin. This is a particularly stable configuration due to maximized exchange energy. Oxygen, with a $2p^4$ configuration, has one of its $p$ orbitals' doubly occupied. The two electrons in this orbital experience electron-electron repulsion, which makes it easier to remove one of them compared to removing an electron from Nitrogen's stable half-filled subshell. Consequently, the first ionization energy of Nitrogen is greater than that of Oxygen. We have the order: N > O.\n\nNow, we can assemble the complete sequence by combining the general trend with these two exceptions.\n- Fluorine (F) is the rightmost element in the group (excluding the noble gas Ne), so it has the highest effective nuclear charge and thus the highest first ionization energy.\n- Next, we compare N and O. As established, N > O.\n- Next, we compare Be and B. As established, Be > B.\n- Oxygen's ionization energy is still greater than that of the elements to its left (except for N), and Be's ionization energy is greater than B's.\n- Combining these facts, the order from left to right with corrected ionization energies is: B < Be < C < O < N < F.\n\nFiltering for the elements in our set {Be, B, N, O, F} and arranging them in decreasing order of first ionization energy, we get:\nF > N > O > Be > B\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. F > O > N > B > Be: Incorrect. Mixes up both N/O and Be/B exceptions.\nB. F > N > O > Be > B: Correct. Accounts for both the N>O and Be>B exceptions.\nC. F > N > O > B > Be: Incorrect. Fails to account for the Be > B exception.\nD. F > O > N > Be > B: Incorrect. Fails to account for the N > O exception.\nE. Be > B > O > N > F: Incorrect.

This problem puts you in that role, asking you to interpret a set of successive ionization energies.

A key principle is that $IE_{n+1} > IE_{n}$ for all $n$, and a particularly large jump between $IE_{n}$ and $IE_{n+1}$ indicates that after removing $n$ valence electrons, the next electron to be removed is a core electron, which is much more strongly bound due to higher effective nuclear charge and a closed-shell configuration.\n\nGiven the data:\n$$IE_{1} = 590\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1},\\quad IE_{2} = 1145\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1},\\quad IE_{3} = 4912\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1},\\quad IE_{4} = 6491\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}.$$\nCompute successive increases:\n$$\\Delta_{1} = IE_{2} - IE_{1} = 1145 - 590 = 555\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1},$$\n$$\\Delta_{2} = IE_{3} - IE_{2} = 4912 - 1145 = 3767\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1},$$\n$$\\Delta_{3} = IE_{4} - IE_{3} = 6491 - 4912 = 1579\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}.$$\nThe dramatic jump occurs between $IE_{2}$ and $IE_{3}$. This indicates that two electrons are relatively easy to remove (valence electrons), while removal of the third electron requires accessing the core. For main-group elements, the number of readily removed valence electrons corresponds to the group for the $s$-block and $p$-block count; having two valence electrons identifies an alkaline earth metal.\n\nTherefore, element $X$ most likely belongs to Group 2 (alkaline earth metals).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2011178"}, {"introduction": "The concept of ionization energy becomes a powerful analytical tool in Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES), a technique that directly probes the electronic structure of atoms.

X = 3p, Y = 2p, Z = 3s", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires applying two fundamental principles of Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES). First, the binding energy of an electron is the energy required to remove it from its orbital. Electrons in orbitals closer to the nucleus experience a greater effective nuclear charge, are held more tightly, and thus have a higher binding energy. Second, the relative intensity (or height/area) of a peak in a PES spectrum is proportional to the number of electrons in the subshell from which they were ejected.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the electron configuration of silicon.**\nSilicon (Si) has an atomic number (Z) of 14. Its ground-state electron configuration is:\n$1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^2$\nThe problem focuses on three peaks, which correspond to three of the subshells. Given the energies, these are the outermost subshells: 2p, 3s, and 3p. The core 1s and 2s electrons have much higher binding energies and are not represented by these peaks.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the binding energies.**\nThe binding energy of an electron is primarily determined by its principal quantum number ($n$) and its orbital type (s, p, d, f). Generally, for a given atom, binding energy decreases as the distance from the nucleus increases. The ordering of the subshells from closest to the nucleus to furthest (for the subshells in question) is 2p, 3s, and 3p. Within the same principal quantum shell (n=3), the 3s orbital is slightly more penetrating and lower in energy than the 3p orbital, meaning 3s electrons are held more tightly than 3p electrons.\nTherefore, the expected order of binding energies is:\nBinding Energy(2p) > Binding Energy(3s) > Binding Energy(3p)\n\nNow, let's look at the experimental data for the peaks:\n- Peak X: 135 eV (Highest binding energy)\n- Peak Y: 17.5 eV (Intermediate binding energy)\n- Peak Z: 8.15 eV (Lowest binding energy)\n\nBy matching the expected trend with the experimental data, we can make an initial assignment:\n- Peak X corresponds to the 2p subshell.\n- Peak Y corresponds to the 3s subshell.\n- Peak Z corresponds to the 3p subshell.\n\n**Step 3: Corroborate the assignment using relative intensities.**\nThe relative intensity of a peak is proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. Let's count the electrons in each subshell from the electron configuration:\n- 2p subshell: 6 electrons\n- 3s subshell: 2 electrons\n- 3p subshell: 2 electrons\n\nThe ratio of electrons in these subshells is 6:2:2, which simplifies to 3:1:1.\n\nNow, let's examine the given relative intensities of the peaks:\n- Peak X: Relative Intensity = 3\n- Peak Y: Relative Intensity = 1\n- Peak Z: Relative Intensity = 1\n\nThe observed intensity ratio of 3:1:1 perfectly matches the ratio of electrons in the 2p, 3s, and 3p subshells, respectively. This confirms our assignment from Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Final Assignment and Selection of the Correct Option.**\nBased on both binding energy and relative intensity analysis, the correct assignment is:\n- **Peak X** (Highest energy, intensity 3) = **2p** subshell (6 electrons)\n- **Peak Y** (Intermediate energy, intensity 1) = **3s** subshell (2 electrons)\n- **Peak Z** (Lowest energy, intensity 1) = **3p** subshell (2 electrons)\n\nThis assignment, {X=2p, Y=3s, Z=3p}, corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2279657"}]}
