Both molecules consist of a central atom (carbon or sulfur) bonded to two oxygen atoms. Oxygen is more electronegative than both carbon and sulfur.\n\nSelect the option below that provides the most accurate and complete explanation for this observed difference in molecular polarity.\n\nA. The electronegativity difference between sulfur and oxygen is significant, creating polar S-O bonds, while the electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen is negligible, resulting in nonpolar C-O bonds.\n\nB. In $\\text{CO}_2$, the carbon atom has no lone pairs, leading to a linear geometry. In $\\text{SO}_2$, the sulfur atom also has no lone pairs on it, but its larger atomic size compared to carbon forces the molecule into a bent geometry, thus making the molecule polar.\n\nC. Both $\\text{CO}_2$ and $\\text{SO}_2$ contain polar covalent bonds due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen. However, the molecular geometry of $\\text{CO}_2$ is linear, which causes the individual bond dipoles to be oriented in opposite directions and thus cancel each other out. In contrast, the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the central sulfur atom in $\\text{SO}_2$ results in a bent molecular geometry, leading to a non-zero net dipole moment.\n\nD. Molecular polarity is determined exclusively by the polarity of the bonds within the molecule. Therefore, $\\text{CO}_2$ is nonpolar because its C-O bonds are inherently nonpolar, whereas $\\text{SO}_2$ is polar because its S-O bonds are polar. The geometric arrangement of atoms is irrelevant to the overall polarity.\n\nE. According to the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model, both molecules have a linear geometry. The polarity of $\\text{SO}_2$ arises because it exhibits resonance, which creates a permanent and uneven distribution of charge that is absent in the more stable structure of $\\text{CO}_2$.", "solution": "Molecular polarity is determined by the net dipole moment of the molecule, defined as the vector sum of all individual bond dipole moments and any contributions from lone pairs on the central atom.

Therefore, the presence or absence of overall molecular polarity must arise from molecular geometry.\n\nFor $\\text{CO}_2$, the central carbon has two electron domains (two C=O double bonds) and no lone pairs. By the VSEPR model, the electron-domain and molecular geometry is linear with O-C-O bond angle $\\theta=\\pi$. The two C-O bond dipoles have equal magnitude and are colinear but opposite in direction, so\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{net}}=\\vec{\\mu}_{1}+\\vec{\\mu}_{2}=\\vec{0},\n$$\nmaking $\\text{CO}_2$ nonpolar.\n\nFor $\\text{SO}_2$, the central sulfur has three electron domains (two S=O bonds and one lone pair). VSEPR predicts a trigonal planar electron-domain geometry and a bent molecular geometry ($\\text{AX}_2\\text{E}$) with O-S-O bond angle $\\theta\\pi$. The two S-O bond dipoles are equal in magnitude but separated by an angle $\\theta$.

Thus, $\\text{SO}_2$ has a nonzero net dipole moment and is polar.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that both molecules have polar bonds, but $\\text{CO}_2$ is linear so its bond dipoles cancel, while $\\text{SO}_2$ is bent due to a lone pair on sulfur so its bond dipoles do not cancel. This corresponds exactly to option C. The other options are incorrect because: A incorrectly claims C-O bonds are nonpolar; B incorrectly states sulfur has no lone pair and attributes bending to atomic size; D incorrectly ignores geometry; E incorrectly assigns linear geometry to $\\text{SO}_2$ and misattributes polarity to resonance rather than vector addition of bond dipoles in a bent geometry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2010780"}]}
