For an isoelectronic series, the dominant variable controlling ionic size is the nuclear charge $Z$.

Consider the two common ions of iron, $Fe^{2+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the difference in their ionic radii?\n\nA. $Fe^{3+}$ is smaller than $Fe^{2+}$ because the removal of an additional electron reduces electron-electron repulsion and increases the effective nuclear charge experienced by the remaining electrons, causing the electron cloud to contract.\n\nB. $Fe^{3+}$ is larger than $Fe^{2+}$ because having fewer electrons reduces the overall electron density, allowing the electron cloud to expand.\n\nC. The ionic radii of $Fe^{2+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$ are nearly identical because the electron is removed from a d-orbital, which does not significantly contribute to the atomic size.\n\nD. $Fe^{2+}$ is smaller than $Fe^{3+}$ because the electron configuration of $Fe^{2+}$ ($[\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^6$) is less stable than the half-filled d-orbital configuration of $Fe^{3+}$ ($[\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^5$), leading to a more compact structure.\n\nE. $Fe^{3+}$ is smaller than $Fe^{2+}$ because the nuclear charge of iron increases when it loses three electrons instead of two.", "solution": "We compare the ionic sizes of $Fe^{2+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$ using the concept of effective nuclear charge and electron-electron repulsion.\n\nFirst, the nuclear charge $Z$ of iron is fixed by its atomic number and does not change with ionization. Thus, any size change between oxidation states must come from changes in screening and the resulting effective nuclear charge experienced by the remaining electrons.\n\nThe effective nuclear charge is defined as\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-S,\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the screening (shielding) constant arising from electron-electron repulsions. When an electron is removed, the screening decreases by some $\\Delta S>0$, so for a given element,\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{3+}=Z-(S-\\Delta S)=Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2+}+\\Delta S.\n$$\nHence $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ increases when going from $Fe^{2+}$ to $Fe^{3+}$.\n\nThe radial extent of the electron cloud for electrons in a given principal quantum number $n$ scales inversely with $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. A hydrogenic-like estimate gives\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle \\propto \\frac{n^{2}a_{0}}{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}},\n$$\nso an increase in $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ leads to a contraction of the electron cloud and thus a smaller ionic radius.\n\nFor iron, the ground-state configurations are\n$$ \\text{Fe: } [\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^6 4s^2, \\quad \\text{Fe}^{2+}: [\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^6, \\quad \\text{Fe}^{3+}: [\\text{Ar}]\\,3d^5 $$\nThe $4s$ electrons are removed first, and further ionization removes a $3d$ electron. Removing this additional $3d$ electron reduces electron-electron repulsion among the $3d$ electrons and decreases screening, thereby increasing $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the remaining electrons. Consequently, $Fe^{3+}$ has a smaller ionic radius than $Fe^{2+}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A states that $Fe^{3+}$ is smaller than $Fe^{2+}$ because removing an extra electron reduces electron-electron repulsion and increases $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, causing contraction. This is the correct, fundamental explanation.\n- B incorrectly claims expansion with fewer electrons; in fact, contraction occurs due to larger $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n- C is incorrect because removing a $3d$ electron does affect screening and size; $d$ electrons contribute to shielding and spatial extent.\n- D conflates electronic stability (half-filled subshell) with size and also gets the size trend wrong.\n- E is incorrect because the nuclear charge $Z$ of iron does not change with ionization state.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2010967"}, {"introduction": "The general rule that ionic size increases down a group is powerful, but the most interesting chemistry often lies in the exceptions. This final practice [@problem_id:2010985] presents the classic case of Zirconium ($Zr^{4+}$) and Hafnium ($Hf^{4+}$), which have nearly identical ionic radii despite Hafnium being in the period below Zirconium. Resolving this apparent anomaly will require you to apply your understanding of nuclear charge and electron shielding to a phenomenon known as the lanthanide contraction, revealing the profound impact of inner-shell electrons.", "problem": "In the periodic table, Zirconium (Zr), with atomic number Z=40, is in Period 5, Group 4. Hafnium (Hf), with atomic number Z=72, is directly below it in Period 6, Group 4. Based on general periodic trends, one would expect the ionic radius to increase significantly when moving down a group due to the addition of a new principal electron shell. However, the ionic radius of $Zr^{4+}$ is 72 pm, while the ionic radius of $Hf^{4+}$ is nearly identical at 71 pm.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best scientific explanation for this anomaly?\n\nA. The filling of the 3d orbitals before the 4p orbitals across the first transition series causes a \"d-block contraction,\" which makes all subsequent elements smaller than predicted, an effect that is maximized at Hafnium.\n\nB. Relativistic effects become significant for heavy elements like Hafnium, causing the 1s electrons to travel at speeds near the speed of light. This increases their mass, which contracts the entire electron cloud, fortuitously matching Zirconium's ionic size.\n\nC. The effective nuclear charge experienced by the outermost electrons of Hafnium is unusually low compared to Zirconium because the larger number of core electrons provides more complete shielding.\n\nD. The filling of the fourteen 4f orbitals in the elements preceding Hafnium (the lanthanides) provides very poor shielding of the nuclear charge. This results in a stronger-than-expected attraction for Hafnium's valence electrons, contracting its radius.\n\nE. Since both $Zr^{4+}$ and $Hf^{4+}$ are formed by losing four valence electrons, their resulting electron configurations become isoelectronic to the preceding noble gases, which forces them into a similarly sized, stable arrangement.", "solution": "We begin with the general principle that ionic radius down a group tends to increase because the principal quantum number $n$ of the outer shell increases. For a hydrogenic model, the characteristic radial scale follows $r \\sim \\frac{a_{0} n^{2}}{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$, where $a_{0}$ is the Bohr radius and $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective nuclear charge defined by $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = Z - S$, with $S$ the shielding constant. Thus, increasing $n$ tends to increase $r$, while increasing $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ tends to decrease $r$.\n\nFor $Zr^{4+}$ and $Hf^{4+}$, the anomaly (nearly identical ionic radii despite moving from Period 5 to Period 6) is explained by an increase in $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for Hafnium that compensates for the increase in $n$. Specifically, in moving from Zr to Hf, the intervening lanthanides add electrons to the $4f$ subshell. The $4f$ electrons are known to shield the nuclear charge poorly compared to $s$, $p$, and even $d$ electrons. Consequently, for elements following the lanthanides, the valence $5d$ and $6s$ electrons experience a larger $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ than would be expected from simple shell addition, which contracts the atomic and ionic radii. This systematic increase in $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ across the lanthanide series is known as the lanthanide contraction. Therefore, although Hf has a higher principal quantum number for its valence shell than Zr, the increased $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ due to poor shielding by the filled $4f$ subshell contracts Hf’s radius, rendering $r(Hf^{4+}) \\approx r(Zr^{4+})$.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\n- Option A attributes the effect to a so-called \"d-block contraction\" arising from $3d$ filling before $4p$ in the first transition series. This phenomenon does not account for the similarity between Zr and Hf across different periods; the observed effect specifically arises from the lanthanides preceding Hf, not from $3d$ filling in Period 4.\n\n- Option B invokes relativistic effects, citing $1s$ electrons moving near the speed of light. While relativistic effects exist for heavy elements, the dominant and well-established explanation for the Zr–Hf radius similarity is the lanthanide contraction due to poor $4f$ shielding, not an incidental matching via relativistic contraction of the entire electron cloud.\n\n- Option C claims unusually low $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for Hf due to more complete shielding. This is the opposite of what occurs; the $4f$ electrons shield poorly, increasing $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and contracting the radius.\n\n- Option D states that the filling of the $4f$ subshell in the lanthanides provides poor shielding, leading to a stronger effective nuclear attraction for Hf’s valence electrons and contraction of its radius. This is precisely the lanthanide contraction mechanism and is the correct explanation for the observed anomaly.\n\n- Option E argues both ions become isoelectronic with preceding noble gases. $Zr^{4+}$ has the configuration $[\\text{Kr}]$, but $Hf^{4+}$ has $[\\text{Xe}]4f^{14}$, which is not a noble gas configuration. Thus, isoelectronic noble-gas stabilization does not explain the similarity.\n\nTherefore, the best scientific explanation is the lanthanide contraction due to poor shielding by $4f$ electrons, which increases $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for Hf and contracts its ionic radius to nearly match that of $Zr^{4+}$, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2010985"}]}
