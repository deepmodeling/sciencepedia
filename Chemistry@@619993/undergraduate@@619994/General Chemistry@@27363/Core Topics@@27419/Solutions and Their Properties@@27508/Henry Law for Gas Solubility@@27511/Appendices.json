The problem provides the total pressure of the gas mixture, the mole fraction of argon in that mixture, and the Henry's Law constant for argon. The solution involves two main steps: first, calculating the partial pressure of argon using Dalton's Law, and second, using this partial pressure in Henry's Law to find the dissolved concentration.\n\nFirst, we apply Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. This law states that the partial pressure of a gas ($P_{gas}$) in a mixture of gases is equal to the mole fraction of that gas ($\\chi_{gas}$) multiplied by the total pressure of the mixture ($P_{total}$). For argon (Ar) in this system, the relationship is:\n$$P_{Ar} = \\chi_{Ar} \\cdot P_{total}$$\n\nWe are given the mole fraction of argon, $\\chi_{Ar} = 0.0120$, and the total pressure, $P_{total} = 1.80 \\text{ atm}$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$P_{Ar} = (0.0120) \\cdot (1.80 \\text{ atm})$$\n$$P_{Ar} = 0.0216 \\text{ atm}$$\n\nNext, we use Henry's Law to relate the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid to its concentration within the liquid. Henry's Law is given by the formula:\n$$C = k_H \\cdot P_{gas}$$\nwhere $C$ is the molar concentration of the dissolved gas, $k_H$ is the Henry's Law constant for that specific gas and solvent at a given temperature, and $P_{gas}$ is the partial pressure of the gas above the solution.\n\nFor our problem, the concentration of argon, $[Ar]$, is given by:\n$$[Ar] = k_H \\cdot P_{Ar}$$\n\nWe are given the Henry's Law constant, $k_H = 1.40 \\times 10^{-3} \\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\text{L} \\cdot \\text{atm}}$, and we have just calculated the partial pressure of argon, $P_{Ar} = 0.0216 \\text{ atm}$.
