The striking observation that minerals dissolve in superheated water deep within the Earth's crust but precipitate to form \"chimneys\" when this water meets the cold ocean provides a powerful clue about the thermodynamics of dissolution. This exercise challenges you to use Le Châtelier's principle to deduce whether the dissolution process is endothermic or exothermic, linking a macroscopic observation to the standard enthalpy of solution, $\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{soln}$ [@problem_id:2016748]. This problem will sharpen your conceptual reasoning and your ability to connect thermodynamics to real-world geology.", "problem": "Deep-sea hydrothermal vents, often called \"black smokers,\" are environments of extreme temperature and pressure. Water percolating through the Earth's crust is heated to very high temperatures, dissolving minerals from the surrounding rock. This superheated, mineral-rich fluid then erupts from the seafloor into the extremely cold deep-ocean water. A key geological observation is that upon emerging and mixing with the cold seawater, many of the dissolved minerals rapidly precipitate out of solution, forming the characteristic tall, chimney-like structures associated with these vents.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this process involving a hypothetical mineral, \"ventisite\" ($VS_2$). The dissolution of solid ventisite in water is represented by the following equilibrium:\n$$VS_2(s) \\rightleftharpoons V^{4+}(aq) + 2S^{2-}(aq)$$\n\nBased on the observation that ventisite precipitates from the hot solution as it cools, and considering the physical states of the species involved in the equilibrium, which of the following statements provides the most accurate thermodynamic description of this process?\n\nA. The dissolution is endothermic ($\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{soln} > 0$), and its solubility is significantly increased by the high pressures found at hydrothermal vents.\n\nB.

The change in Gibbs free energy for dissolution ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{soln}$) is independent of temperature, and the solubility is primarily determined by pressure.", "solution": "The dissolution equilibrium is\n$$VS_{2}(s) \\rightleftharpoons V^{4+}(aq) + 2S^{2-}(aq).$$\nWith the activity of the pure solid taken as unity, the equilibrium constant is\n$$K = a\\!\\left(V^{4+}\\right)\\,a\\!\\left(S^{2-}\\right)^{2}.$$\nThe observed precipitation upon cooling implies that, as temperature decreases, the equilibrium shifts to the left (toward the solid), so the solubility decreases with decreasing temperature and is higher at higher temperature. Therefore, the equilibrium constant increases with temperature, i.e., $\\frac{dK}{dT}>0$.\n\nThe van ’t Hoff relation connects the temperature dependence of $K$ to the standard reaction enthalpy:\n$$\\frac{d\\ln K}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{R\\,T^{2}}.$$\nSince $\\frac{d\\ln K}{dT}>0$, it follows that\n$$\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{soln} > 0,$$\nso the dissolution is endothermic.\n\nThe pressure dependence of an equilibrium constant at fixed temperature is given by\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln K}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T} = -\\frac{\\Delta V^{\\circ}}{R\\,T},$$\nwhere $\\Delta V^{\\circ}$ is the standard reaction volume. For dissolution of a solid into solvated ions in water, $\\Delta V^{\\circ}$ is typically small in magnitude (no gaseous species are involved and the partial molar volume changes upon hydration are modest). Consequently, the dependence of $K$ (and thus solubility) on pressure is weak, and high hydrostatic pressures at hydrothermal vents do not significantly alter the solubility compared to the dominant temperature effect.\n\nCombining these two results, the correct description is that the dissolution is endothermic and its solubility is not significantly affected by high pressure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2016748"}, {"introduction": "In the previous exercise, we considered the effect of temperature to be dominant for solid solubility.
