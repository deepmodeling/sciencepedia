This practice addresses that question by focusing on kinetic stability, typically achieved via surface charge, and its deliberate disruption through coagulation. By considering the removal of a charged colloidal pollutant from wastewater [@problem_id:1985635], you will apply the fundamental Schulze-Hardy rule to predict how an electrolyte's counter-ion charge dictates its effectiveness in destabilizing a colloid.", "problem": "A chemical engineer is tasked with developing a cost-effective method for removing a colloidal pollutant, specifically arsenious sulfide ($As_2S_3$), from industrial wastewater. Analysis of the wastewater reveals that the $As_2S_3$ colloidal particles, which form a stable sol, possess a net negative surface charge. The proposed removal method is coagulation, where an electrolyte is added to the water to neutralize the charge on the colloidal particles, causing them to aggregate and settle out.\n\nThe engineer has two readily available, inexpensive salts to test as coagulating agents: sodium chloride ($NaCl$) and magnesium chloride ($MgCl_2$). The primary factor determining the coagulation efficiency of an electrolyte for a charged sol is the valence (charge) of the ion that has a charge opposite to that of the colloidal particles.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of colloid chemistry, which of the following statements most accurately compares the expected performance of the two salts for coagulating the negatively charged arsenious sulfide sol?\n\nA. Sodium chloride ($NaCl$) will be more effective because the $Na^{+}$ ion has a smaller ionic radius than the $Mg^{2+}$ ion, allowing for a more concentrated charge density.\n\nB. Both salts will be equally effective as long as their molar concentrations are the same, since they are both strong electrolytes.\n\nC. Magnesium chloride ($MgCl_2$) will be more effective because the $Mg^{2+}$ ion possesses a greater positive charge than the $Na^{+}$ ion.\n\nD. Magnesium chloride ($MgCl_2$) will be more effective because it provides two chloride ions ($Cl^{-}$) for every magnesium ion, which helps to screen the repulsion between the colloidal particles.\n\nE. Sodium chloride ($NaCl$) will be more effective because chloride ($Cl^{-}$) is a smaller anion than the sulfide ($S^{2-}$) on the colloid, leading to more efficient charge neutralization.", "solution": "We are given a negatively charged lyophobic sol of arsenious sulfide, so the ions that cause coagulation are the counter ions, namely the cations. The primary principle governing coagulation efficiency for lyophobic sols is the Schulze–Hardy rule.\n\nBy the Schulze–Hardy rule, for a given sol, the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) required of an electrolyte is dominated by the valency of the counter ion, with\n$$\n\\text{CCC} \\propto \\frac{1}{z^{6}},\n$$\nwhere $z$ is the absolute valency of the counter ion. Equivalently, the coagulating power is proportional to $z^{6}$.\n\nFor the two candidate salts:\n- In $NaCl$, the counter ion is $Na^{+}$ with $z=1$.\n- In $MgCl_{2}$, the counter ion is $Mg^{2+}$ with $z=2$.\n\nTherefore, the relative coagulating power of $Mg^{2+}$ compared to $Na^{+}$ scales as\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2}{1}\\right)^{6} = 64,\n$$\nso $MgCl_{2}$ is much more effective at coagulating the negatively charged $As_{2}S_{3}$ sol.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A is incorrect because ionic radius is not the dominant factor; valency of the counter ion is.\n- B is incorrect because, even at the same molar concentration and for strong electrolytes, the higher-valent counter ion yields far greater coagulation efficiency.\n- C is correct because $Mg^{2+}$ has greater positive charge than $Na^{+}$, which directly increases coagulating power by the Schulze–Hardy rule.\n- D is incorrect because the anion $Cl^{-}$ is a co-ion for a negatively charged sol and does not control coagulation; the decisive factor is the cation valency.\n- E is incorrect because the size of $Cl^{-}$ relative to $S^{2-}$ is irrelevant; again, the counter ion’s valency governs coagulation.\n\nThus, magnesium chloride is more effective due to the higher valency of $Mg^{2+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1985635"}, {"introduction": "The immense surface area that makes colloids energetically costly to create is also their most powerful feature for practical applications.
