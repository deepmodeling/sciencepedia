[@problem_id:1984368]", "problem": "A student is tasked with predicting the boiling point of an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving a significant amount of ethanol, $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\text{OH}$, in water. The student uses the standard boiling point elevation formula for colligative properties, $\\Delta T_b = i K_b m$, where $\\Delta T_b$ is the change in boiling point, $i$ is the van't Hoff factor (assumed to be 1 for ethanol), $K_b$ is the ebullioscopic constant for water, and $m$ is the molality of the ethanol. Based on this calculation, the student predicts that the solution will boil at a temperature higher than the normal boiling point of pure water (100.00 °C at 1 atm).\n\nHowever, upon conducting the experiment carefully, the student is surprised to find that the solution actually begins to boil at a temperature *below* 100.00 °C.

The van't Hoff factor for ethanol is not 1; it is significantly greater than 1 because ethanol molecules dissociate in water.\n\nB. The boiling point elevation formula, $\\Delta T_b = i K_b m$, is only valid for ideal solutions, and an ethanol-water mixture exhibits strong non-ideal behavior that suppresses the boiling point.\n\nC. The derivation of the boiling point elevation formula, $\\Delta T_b = i K_b m$, fundamentally assumes that the solute is non-volatile. Ethanol is a volatile substance that contributes its own vapor pressure to the system, which this formula neglects.\n\nD. The ebullioscopic constant, $K_b$, for water is only applicable for ionic solutes, and a different constant should have been used for a molecular solute like ethanol.\n\nE. The dissolution of ethanol in water is a strongly endothermic process, which cools the solution and lowers the energy required to reach the boiling point.", "solution": "The standard boiling point elevation relation $\\Delta T_{b} = i K_{b} m$ is derived under the fundamental assumption that the solute is non-volatile, so that it contributes no vapor to the gas phase. In that case, Raoult’s law for the solvent gives the solution vapor pressure as\n$$\nP_{\\text{solution}}(T) = x_{1} P_{1}^{*}(T),\n$$\nwhere $x_{1}$ is the mole fraction of the solvent (water) and $P_{1}^{*}(T)$ is the saturation vapor pressure of pure water at temperature $T$. For boiling at an external pressure $P_{\\text{ext}}$, the condition is $P_{\\text{solution}}(T_{b,\\text{soln}}) = P_{\\text{ext}}$. Because $x_{1} < 1$, one requires $P_{1}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{soln}}) > P_{\\text{ext}}$, which occurs at a higher temperature than the pure solvent’s normal boiling point $T_{b}^{(1)}$ satisfying $P_{1}^{*}(T_{b}^{(1)}) = P_{\\text{ext}}$. This leads to $\\Delta T_{b} > 0$ and yields the formula $\\Delta T_{b} = i K_{b} m$.\n\nHowever, ethanol is a volatile solute. For a solution of two volatile components that behaves ideally, Dalton’s law and Raoult’s law give the total vapor pressure as\n$$\nP_{\\text{tot}}(T) = x_{1} P_{1}^{*}(T) + x_{2} P_{2}^{*}(T),\n$$\nwhere $x_{2}$ is the mole fraction of ethanol and $P_{2}^{*}(T)$ is the saturation vapor pressure of pure ethanol at temperature $T$. The boiling condition is\n$$\nx_{1} P_{1}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}}) + x_{2} P_{2}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}}) = P_{\\text{ext}}.\n$$\nLet $T_{b}^{(1)}$ denote the normal boiling point of pure water, so $P_{1}^{*}(T_{b}^{(1)}) = P_{\\text{ext}}$. Because $x_{2} > 0$ and $P_{2}^{*}(T) > 0$ for all relevant $T$, the relation\n$$\nx_{1} P_{1}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}}) = P_{\\text{ext}} - x_{2} P_{2}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}}) < P_{\\text{ext}}\n$$\nimplies\n$$\nP_{1}^{*}(T_{b,\\text{mix}}) < P_{1}^{*}(T_{b}^{(1)}).\n$$\nSince $P_{1}^{*}(T)$ is a strictly increasing function of $T$, it follows that\n$$\nT_{b,\\text{mix}} < T_{b}^{(1)}.\n$$\nThus, in the presence of a volatile solute like ethanol, the total vapor pressure can reach $P_{\\text{ext}}$ at a temperature below the normal boiling point of pure water, so the mixture can boil below the boiling point of pure water. The elevation formula $\\Delta T_{b} = i K_{b} m$ does not apply because its derivation neglects the solute’s vapor pressure by assuming a non-volatile solute.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the formula’s derivation assumes a non-volatile solute, whereas ethanol is volatile and contributes to the vapor pressure. This corresponds to option C. The other options are inconsistent: ethanol does not dissociate (A is false), non-ideality is not required to explain the observed lowering since the effect already arises for ideal volatile mixtures (B is not the fundamental reason), $K_{b}$ is not restricted to ionic solutes (D is false), and the enthalpy of mixing does not determine the equilibrium boiling point (E is irrelevant to the discrepancy).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1984368"}]}
