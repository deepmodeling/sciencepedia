All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the problem is scientifically grounded and well-posed. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe proposed mechanism consists of two elementary steps:\n$$A \\xrightarrow{k_{1}} I$$\n$$I + B \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} P$$\n\nThe rate of product formation, which is defined as the overall rate of reaction $v$, is given by the law of mass action for the second step:\n$$v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[I][B]$$\nThe concentration of the intermediate, $[I]$, is not an independently controlled variable. Its value is determined by the kinetics of its formation (from $A$) and its consumption (reaction with $B$). The problem statement requires an analysis based on the rate-determining step approximation, which considers two distinct limiting regimes based on the relative magnitudes of the rates of the elementary steps. The problem states that the initial rate, $v_{0}$, is measured under conditions where concentrations of reactants $A$ and $B$ have not been significantly depleted, so we may approximate $[A] \\approx [A]_{0}$ and $[B] \\approx [B]_{0}$.\n\nTask 1: Determination of the Rate-Determining Step in Limiting Regimes\n\nRegime 1: Low-[$B$] Concentration\nAt very low concentrations of reactant $B$, the second step, $I + B \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} P$, which is bimolecular and thus dependent on $[B]$, is expected to be slow. We hypothesize that this is the rate-determining step. This implies that the first step, $A \\xrightarrow{k_{1}} I$, is comparatively fast. The condition for this regime is that the characteristic rate of step 1 is much greater than the characteristic rate of step 2, which can be expressed in terms of the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the consumption of $I$, i.e., $k_{1} \\gg k_{2}[B]_{0}$.\n\nIf step 1 is fast and irreversible, and step 2 is slow, then reactant $A$ is converted to intermediate $I$ on a timescale much shorter than the timescale of product formation. Thus, for the purposes of analyzing the subsequent slow step, we can approximate the concentration of intermediate as being equal to the initial concentration of A, $[I] \\approx [A]_{0}$. The overall rate is then dictated by the slow second step:\n$$v_{0} = k_{2}[I][B]_{0} \\approx k_{2}[A]_{0}[B]_{0}$$\nThis rate law predicts that for low $[B]_{0}$, the initial rate $v_{0}$ is directly proportional to $[B]_{0}$. The slope of a plot of $v_{0}$ versus $[B]_{0}$ in this regime is therefore a constant:\n$$S_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{dv_{0}}{d[B]_{0}} = k_{2}[A]_{0}$$\nThe experimental data for $[B]_{0}$ from $1.00$ mM to $10.0$ mM show this linear dependence. For example, at $[B]_{0} = 1.00$ mM, $v_{0} = 0.0400$ mM s$^{-1}$, and at $[B]_{0} = 10.0$ mM, $v_{0} = 0.400$ mM s$^{-1}$. The ratio $v_{0}/[B]_{0}$ is constant at $0.0400$ s$^{-1}$. This confirms that in the low-$[B]_{0}$ regime, the second step, $I + B \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} P$, is rate-determining.\n\nRegime 2: High-[$B$] Concentration\nAt very high concentrations of reactant $B$, the second step becomes very fast. The rate of the overall reaction can no longer be accelerated by increasing $[B]_{0}$ further. In this limit, the first step, $A \\xrightarrow{k_{1}} I$, becomes the bottleneck of the process. This is the rate-determining step. The condition for this regime is $k_{1} \\ll k_{2}[B]_{0}$.\n\nWhen step 1 is rate-determining, the overall rate of the reaction sequence is simply the rate of this slow step.\n$$v_{0} = k_{1}[A]_{0}$$\nThis rate law predicts that at high $[B]_{0}$, the initial rate $v_{0}$ becomes independent of $[B]_{0}$ and reaches a maximum, constant value, or plateau.\n$$v_{\\text{max}} = k_{1}[A]_{0}$$\nThe experimental data for $[B]_{0} = 20.0$ mM, $40.0$ mM, and $100.0$ mM all show the same rate, $v_{0} = 0.800$ mM s$^{-1}$. This saturation behavior confirms that in the high-$[B]_{0}$ regime, the first step, $A \\xrightarrow{k_{1}} I$, is rate-determining.\n\nTask 2: Derivation of the Crossover Concentration, $[B]^{\\ast}$\n\nThe transition between these two kinetic regimes occurs at a crossover concentration, $[B]^{\\ast}$, where the control shifts from one step to the other. The problem specifies defining this point by matching the characteristic timescales of the two elementary steps.\n\nThe characteristic timescale of the first step, which describes the lifetime of reactant $A$ with respect to its unimolecular conversion to $I$, is:\n$$\\tau_{1} = \\frac{1}{k_{1}}$$\nThe characteristic timescale of the second step can be viewed as the lifetime of the intermediate $I$ with respect to its consumption by $B$. The process is pseudo-first-order in $[I]$ with a rate constant $k_{2}[B]$. The corresponding timescale is:\n$$\\tau_{2} = \\frac{1}{k_{2}[B]}$$\nThe crossover occurs when these two timescales are equal. At the crossover concentration $[B] = [B]^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\tau_{1} = \\tau_{2} \\implies \\frac{1}{k_{1}} = \\frac{1}{k_{2}[B]^{\\ast}}$$\nSolving for $[B]^{\\ast}$ gives the analytic expression:\n$$[B]^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}$$\nTo connect this to experimentally accessible quantities, we use the expressions derived from the limiting slopes. From the high-$[B]_{0}$ regime, we have $k_{1} = v_{\\text{max}}/[A]_{0}$. From the low-$[B]_{0}$ regime, we have $k_{2} = S_{\\text{low}}/[A]_{0}$. Substituting these into the expression for $[B]^{\\ast}$:\n$$[B]^{\\ast} = \\frac{v_{\\text{max}}/[A]_{0}}{S_{\\text{low}}/[A]_{0}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{max}}}{S_{\\text{low}}}$$\nThus, the crossover concentration is given by the ratio of the maximum (plateau) rate to the initial slope of the $v_{0}$ versus $[B]_{0}$ curve.\n\nTask 3: Numerical Computation of $[B]^{\\ast}$\n\nWe now extract the required values from the provided experimental data.\nFrom the high-$[B]_{0}$ data points ($[B]_{0} \\ge 20.0$ mM), we identify the plateau rate:\n$$v_{\\text{max}} = 0.800 \\text{ mM s}^{-1}$$\nFrom the low-$[B]_{0}$ data points ($[B]_{0} \\le 10.0$ mM), where the rate is linear with $[B]_{0}$, we compute the initial slope, $S_{\\text{low}}$. For any point in this region, $S_{\\text{low}} = v_{0}/[B]_{0}$. Using the point $([B]_{0}, v_{0}) = (1.00 \\text{ mM}, 0.0400 \\text{ mM s}^{-1})$:\n$$S_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{0.0400 \\text{ mM s}^{-1}}{1.00 \\text{ mM}} = 0.0400 \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\nThis slope is consistent across all four data points in the linear regime.\n\nNow, we compute $[B]^{\\ast}$ using the derived formula:\n$$[B]^{\\ast} = \\frac{v_{\\text{max}}}{S_{\\text{low}}} = \\frac{0.800 \\text{ mM s}^{-1}}{0.0400 \\text{ s}^{-1}} = 20.0 \\text{ mM}$$\nThe result is $20.0$ mM.
