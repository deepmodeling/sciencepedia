In a study of a new prototype OLED material, the brightness of the display is found to be directly proportional to the concentration of the active, non-degraded emissive molecule. Experimental data reveals that the degradation of this molecule follows second-order kinetics with respect to its own concentration.\n\nDuring an accelerated aging test, a display is operated continuously under standard conditions. After 525 hours of operation, its brightness is measured to be 85.0% of its initial brightness. A display is considered to have reached the end of its useful life when its brightness drops to 35.0% of its initial value.\n\nCalculate the total operational lifetime of this prototype display, defined as the time it takes for the brightness to drop to this 35.0% threshold.

The degradation process follows second-order kinetics, so its rate can be described by the integrated rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_t} - \\frac{1}{[A]_0} = kt\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant.\n\nThe problem states that the brightness of the display, $I(t)$, is directly proportional to the concentration $[A]_t$. This can be written as $I(t) = c[A]_t$, where $c$ is a proportionality constant. The initial brightness is $I_0 = c[A]_0$. The ratio of brightness at time $t$ to the initial brightness is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{I(t)}{I_0} = \\frac{c[A]_t}{c[A]_0} = \\frac{[A]_t}{[A]_0}\n$$\nThis relationship allows us to express concentrations in terms of brightness percentages.\n\nFirst, we use the data from the accelerated aging test to determine the value of the rate constant $k$, or more conveniently, a product involving $k$. We are given that at $t_1 = 525$ hours, the brightness is 85.0% of the initial brightness.\n$$\n\\frac{I(t_1)}{I_0} = 0.850\n$$\nThis implies that the concentration at this time is:\n$$\n[A]_{t_1} = 0.850 [A]_0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the second-order integrated rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{0.850 [A]_0} - \\frac{1}{[A]_0} = k (525 \\text{ hr})\n$$\nTo solve for $k$, we can factor out $\\frac{1}{[A]_0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{0.850} - 1 \\right) = 525k\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_0} \\left( \\frac{1 - 0.850}{0.850} \\right) = 525k\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_0} \\left( \\frac{0.150}{0.850} \\right) = 525k\n$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{0.150}{0.850}$ is equal to $\\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3}{17}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_0} \\left( \\frac{3}{17} \\right) = 525k\n$$\nWe can rearrange this to find an expression for $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{3}{17 \\cdot 525 \\cdot [A]_0} = \\frac{1}{17 \\cdot 175 \\cdot [A]_0} = \\frac{1}{2975 [A]_0}\n$$\nNotice that the rate constant $k$ is expressed in terms of the unknown initial concentration $[A]_0$. This is expected for a second-order reaction's rate constant units ($M^{-1}s^{-1}$ or similar).\n\nNext, we need to find the total time, let's call it $T$, for the brightness to drop to 35.0% of its initial value. At this time $T$:\n$$\n\\frac{I(T)}{I_0} = 0.350\n$$\nWhich means the concentration is:\n$$\n[A]_T = 0.350 [A]_0\n$$\nWe apply the integrated rate law again for this condition:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_T} - \\frac{1}{[A]_0} = kT\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{0.350 [A]_0} - \\frac{1}{[A]_0} = kT\n$$\nFactor out $\\frac{1}{[A]_0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{0.350} - 1 \\right) = kT\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_0} \\left( \\frac{1 - 0.350}{0.350} \\right) = kT\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_0} \\left( \\frac{0.650}{0.350} \\right) = kT\n$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{0.650}{0.350}$ is equal to $\\frac{65}{35} = \\frac{13}{7}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[A]_0} \\left( \\frac{13}{7} \\right) = kT\n$$\nNow we have two expressions, one for $k$ and one involving $T$.

The decomposition reaction is found to be second-order with respect to the concentration of $NO_2$. Under these initial conditions, it is observed that the time required for the partial pressure of $NO_2$ to decrease to half of its initial value is 22.5 seconds.\nDetermine the total pressure inside the container after the reaction has proceeded for 50.0 seconds.

The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all gaseous species present, according to Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures:\n$$P_{total} = P_{NO_2} + P_{NO} + P_{O_2}$$\nFirst, we must determine the rate constant for this second-order reaction. Since the problem provides data in partial pressures, it's most direct to work with a rate law expressed in these terms. The integrated rate law and half-life for a second-order reaction can be written in terms of partial pressure ($P_A$) and a pressure-based rate constant ($k_p$):\n$$\\frac{1}{P_{A, t}} = k_p t + \\frac{1}{P_{A, 0}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{k_p P_{A,0}}$$\nWe are given the initial pressure of $NO_2$, $P_{NO_2, 0} = 1.80$ atm, and the corresponding half-life, $t_{1/2} = 22.5$ s.

We can use a pressure-based ICE table (Initial, Change, End) based on the stoichiometry of the reaction $2NO_2(g) \\rightarrow 2NO(g) + O_2(g)$.\nThe change in the partial pressure of $NO_2$ is:\n$$\\Delta P_{NO_2} = P_{NO_2, t} - P_{NO_2, 0} = 0.55861... \\text{ atm} - 1.80 \\text{ atm} = -1.24139... \\text{ atm}$$\nThis represents the amount of $NO_2$ pressure that has reacted.

For every 2 moles (or atm) of $NO_2$ that react, 2 moles (atm) of $NO$ and 1 mole (atm) of $O_2$ are produced, for a net change of $+1$ mole (atm) of gas. The change in total pressure is therefore $\\Delta P_{total} = P_{O_2} = x$.\nThe total pressure is the initial pressure plus this change:\n$$P_{total} = P_{initial} + \\Delta P_{total} = P_{NO_2, 0} + P_{O_2}$$\n$$P_{total} = 1.80 \\text{ atm} + 0.62069... \\text{ atm} = 2.42069... \\text{ atm}$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, we get 2.42 atm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.42}$$", "id": "1998487"}, {"introduction": "This final practice shifts our perspective from simply using integrated rate laws to understanding how they are derived from experimental data.
