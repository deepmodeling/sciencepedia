The exhaust gas from an engine running under standard test conditions is channeled through the converter and collected in a sealed, rigid analysis chamber maintained at a constant temperature of 550 °C. The total pressure of the gas mixture inside the chamber is measured to be 1.12 atm. A specialized sensor within the chamber determines that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO₂) is 121 torr. The primary components of the exhaust mixture are considered to be nitrogen (N₂), water vapor (H₂O), and carbon dioxide (CO₂). Assuming the exhaust gas mixture behaves as an ideal gas, calculate the mole fraction of CO₂.\n\nFor your calculation, use the conversion factor 1 atm = 760 torr. Report your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the mole fraction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in an exhaust gas mixture. We are given the partial pressure of CO₂ and the total pressure of the mixture.\n\nThe relationship between the partial pressure of a gas component, its mole fraction, and the total pressure of the gas mixture is described by Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. For a component $i$ in a gas mixture, the law is stated as:\n$$P_i = x_i P_{\\text{total}}$$\nwhere $P_i$ is the partial pressure of component $i$, $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$, and $P_{\\text{total}}$ is the total pressure of the mixture.\n\nIn this problem, we are interested in carbon dioxide, so we can write:\n$$P_{\\text{CO}_2} = x_{\\text{CO}_2} P_{\\text{total}}$$\n\nWe need to find the mole fraction, $x_{\\text{CO}_2}$, so we can rearrange the equation:\n$$x_{\\text{CO}_2} = \\frac{P_{\\text{CO}_2}}{P_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nPartial pressure of CO₂, $P_{\\text{CO}_2} = 121 \\text{ torr}$\nTotal pressure, $P_{\\text{total}} = 1.12 \\text{ atm}$\n\nBefore we can calculate the mole fraction, the units of pressure for $P_{\\text{CO}_2}$ and $P_{\\text{total}}$ must be consistent. We can convert one of the pressures to match the unit of the other. Let's convert the total pressure from atmospheres (atm) to torr using the given conversion factor, 1 atm = 760 torr.\n\n$$P_{\\text{total}} = 1.12 \\text{ atm} \\times \\frac{760 \\text{ torr}}{1 \\text{ atm}} = 851.2 \\text{ torr}$$\n\nNote that the temperature of the gas (550 °C) is provided but is not needed for this calculation, as the mole fraction can be determined directly from the pressure ratio at any given temperature, provided the mixture behaves ideally.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values (both in torr) into the equation for the mole fraction:\n$$x_{\\text{CO}_2} = \\frac{121 \\text{ torr}}{851.2 \\text{ torr}}$$\n\nThe units of torr cancel out, leaving a dimensionless quantity for the mole fraction, as expected.\n$$x_{\\text{CO}_2} = 0.14215225...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 1, 4, and 2. The fourth digit is 1, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the third digit).\n\n$$x_{\\text{CO}_2} \\approx 0.142$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.142}$$", "id": "1988158"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's apply Dalton's Law to a dynamic chemical system where one component of a gas mixture is consumed by a reaction. This practice demonstrates a powerful deductive use of the law: by observing the change in total pressure, we can determine the initial partial pressure of the reactive gas. This works because, at constant volume and temperature, the partial pressure of any inert gas remains unchanged, making the pressure drop a direct measure of the consumed gas [@problem_id:1976767].", "problem": "A materials science laboratory is testing the oxidation resistance of a new metallic alloy. A sealed, rigid reaction chamber with a fixed volume is filled with a mixture of dry oxygen ($O_2$) and nitrogen ($N_2$) gas, which can be treated as ideal gases. The chamber is kept at a constant temperature throughout the experiment. Initially, the total pressure of the gas mixture inside the chamber is measured to be 805 kPa. A sample of the alloy is then heated inside the chamber, causing it to react completely with all the available oxygen to form a solid metal oxide. The nitrogen gas is inert and does not participate in the reaction. After the reaction is complete and the system has returned to its initial temperature, the pressure of the remaining gas in the chamber is measured to be 636 kPa.\n\nAssuming the volume occupied by the solid alloy and the resulting oxide layer is negligible compared to the chamber volume, determine the initial partial pressure of oxygen ($O_2$) in the chamber. Express your answer in kPa, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the chamber volume be $V$ and the (constant) temperature be $T$. Treating the gases as ideal, each component satisfies the ideal gas law $P V = n R T$, where $P$ is its partial pressure and $n$ the number of moles.\n\nDenote initial moles by $n_{O_{2},0}$ and $n_{N_{2},0}$, with initial total pressure $P_{0}=805$ kPa. Thus the initial partial pressures are:\n$$\nP_{O_{2},0}=\\frac{n_{O_{2},0} R T}{V}, \\quad P_{N_{2},0}=\\frac{n_{N_{2},0} R T}{V}, \\quad P_{0}=P_{O_{2},0}+P_{N_{2},0}.\n$$\n\nThe alloy consumes all $O_{2}$ to form a solid; nitrogen is inert. The volume occupied by the solid is negligible, so the gas occupies the same $V$ before and after, and the system returns to the same $T$. Therefore, after reaction, the only gas remaining is $N_{2}$ with moles $n_{N_{2},f}=n_{N_{2},0}$. The final gas pressure is then\n$$\nP_{f}=\\frac{n_{N_{2},f} R T}{V}=\\frac{n_{N_{2},0} R T}{V}=P_{N_{2},0}.\n$$\n\nGiven $P_{f}=636$ kPa, it follows that the initial partial pressure of nitrogen is $P_{N_{2},0}=636$ kPa. Hence the initial partial pressure of oxygen is\n$$\nP_{O_{2},0}=P_{0}-P_{N_{2},0}=805-636=169 \\text{ kPa}.\n$$\n\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $169$ kPa.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{169}$$", "id": "1976767"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice integrates Dalton's Law with other ideal gas concepts to work backward from a macroscopic property to the mixture's microscopic composition.
