VSEPR predicts a tetrahedral electron-domain geometry. With one lone pair, the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal. Because lone pair–bond pair repulsions are stronger than bond pair–bond pair repulsions, the bond angles compress relative to the ideal tetrahedral angle, so the C–N–H angles are less than $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nFor acetamide, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CONH}_2$, the amide nitrogen’s lone pair is delocalized by resonance with the adjacent carbonyl. Two key resonance structures are the neutral amide form (with an $N$ lone pair and a $C=O$ double bond) and a zwitterionic form (with a $C=N$ double bond and negative charge on oxygen). This delocalization imparts partial double-bond character to the C–N bond and favors planarity at nitrogen to maximize $p$-orbital overlap.
