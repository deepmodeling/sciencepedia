The two C-H sigma bonds form from the overlap of a Carbon $sp^3$ orbital with a Hydrogen $1s$ orbital. The C-O bond is a single sigma bond formed from the overlap of a Carbon $sp^3$ orbital with an Oxygen $sp^3$ orbital.\n\nB.

The central carbon is bonded to two hydrogens and one oxygen with a double bond, giving three regions of electron density around carbon. According to VSEPR, three electron domains imply a trigonal planar geometry and $sp^2$ hybridization on carbon. In $sp^2$ hybridization, carbon has three $sp^2$ hybrid orbitals lying in a plane for forming sigma bonds, and one unhybridized $2p$-orbital perpendicular to the plane available for a pi bond.\n\nThe two C-H sigma bonds arise from head-on overlap of carbon’s $sp^2$ hybrid orbitals with hydrogen $1s$ orbitals. Thus each C-H bond is formed by $sp^2$(C)-$1s$(H) overlap, consistent with sigma bond formation.\n\nThe carbon-oxygen bond in formaldehyde is a double bond, consisting of one sigma bond and one pi bond. For the sigma component, we determine the hybridization on oxygen. Oxygen in formaldehyde has three electron domains: one sigma bond to carbon and two lone pairs. Three domains imply $sp^2$ hybridization on oxygen. Therefore, the C-O sigma bond is formed by head-on overlap of an $sp^2$ hybrid orbital on carbon with an $sp^2$ hybrid orbital on oxygen, i.e., $sp^2$(C)-$sp^2$(O) sigma overlap.\n\nThe remaining unhybridized $2p$-orbital on carbon and an unhybridized $2p$-orbital on oxygen are parallel and overlap side-by-side to form the pi bond. Thus, the C-O pi bond is formed by $2p$(C)-$2p$(O) lateral overlap.\n\nThese assignments match the description in option C. For completeness, we note why the other options are incorrect:\n- A is incorrect because it assigns $sp^3$ hybridization to carbon and treats the C-O bond as a single sigma bond; formaldehyde has a C=O double bond and carbon is $sp^2$.\n- B is incorrect because it assigns the C-O sigma bond as $sp^2$(C)-$2p$(O) rather than involving an $sp^2$ hybrid on oxygen; oxygen in a carbonyl is $sp^2$ for sigma bonding.\n- D is incorrect because it reverses the orbital types for sigma and pi: sigma bonds are formed by head-on overlap of hybrids (not $2p$-$2p$ here), and pi bonds arise from side-by-side overlap of unhybridized $2p$-orbitals (not $sp^2$-$sp^2$).\n- E is incorrect because it describes an $sp$-hybridized carbon and oxygen with a C≡O triple bond, which does not apply to formaldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the C-H sigma bonds are $sp^2$(C)-$1s$(H), the C-O sigma bond is $sp^2$(C)-$sp^2$(O), and the C-O pi bond is formed by unhybridized $2p$-orbitals on carbon and oxygen, as stated in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1994883"}, {"introduction": "While many bonds can be pictured as localized between two atoms, the reality is often more complex, especially in ions and conjugated systems where electrons are shared across multiple atoms in a phenomenon called delocalization.

Thus:\n- Nitrogen contributes one unhybridized $p$-orbital (from its $sp^2$ hybridization).\n- Each of the three oxygen atoms contributes one unhybridized $p$-orbital. By symmetry and resonance, each O bears partial double-bond character and is treated as $sp^2$ with an unhybridized $p$-orbital perpendicular to the plane available for $\\pi$ overlap.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unhybridized atomic $p$-orbitals that overlap to form the delocalized $\\pi$ system is\n$$N_{p,\\text{total}}=1\\ (\\text{from N})+3\\ (\\text{from O atoms})=4.$$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1994874"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical distinction between sigma and pi bonds has profound and observable consequences for a molecule's properties and behavior. One of the most important differences is the energetic barrier to rotation around a double bond, which is absent in single bonds.

The existence of these stable, non-interconverting isomers at room temperature is a direct consequence of the specific nature of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the restricted rotation around the carbon-carbon double bond that gives rise to cis-trans isomerism in 1-chloropropene?\n\nA. The C=C double bond is composed of a sigma bond and a pi bond. The sideways overlap of unhybridized p-orbitals to form the pi bond creates electron density above and below the plane of the sigma bond, effectively locking the bond from rotation.\n\nB. The hydrogens and other groups attached to the $sp^2$ hybridized carbons are all located in the same plane, and this rigid planar structure itself is what prevents rotation.\n\nC. The sigma bond component of the C=C double bond is exceptionally strong and shorter than a C-C single bond, and this increased bond strength alone is responsible for preventing rotation.\n\nD. The electrostatic repulsion between the electron-rich chlorine atom and the methyl group is strong enough to create a permanent energy barrier that stops any rotation around the C=C bond.\n\nE. The $sp^2$ hybridization of the carbon atoms forces the molecule into a trigonal planar geometry, causing significant steric hindrance that prevents the molecule from achieving the transition state required for rotation.", "solution": "Cis-trans isomerism around a carbon-carbon double bond arises from restricted rotation about the $C=C$ bond due to its bonding structure. Each carbon in an alkene is $sp^2$ hybridized, leaving one unhybridized $p$-orbital on each carbon. The $C=C$ double bond consists of one $\\sigma$ bond formed by end-on overlap of $sp^2$ hybrid orbitals along the internuclear axis and one $\\pi$ bond formed by sideways overlap of the parallel unhybridized $p$-orbitals. The $\\pi$ bond places electron density above and below the plane defined by the $\\sigma$ bond.\n\nRotation about the $C=C$ axis by an angle $\\theta$ misaligns the two $p$-orbitals, reducing their overlap. Qualitatively, the overlap integral satisfies $S(\\theta)\\propto \\cos(\\theta)$, so that at $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ the overlap vanishes and the $\\pi$ bond is effectively broken. Therefore, any substantial rotation requires partial loss of $\\pi$ overlap, which raises the energy by approximately the energy associated with the $\\pi$ bond. This creates a large rotational barrier, preventing free rotation at room temperature and allowing distinct cis and trans isomers to be isolable.\n\nEvaluating the statements: Option A correctly identifies the fundamental cause—the $\\pi$ bond from sideways p-p overlap, with electron density above and below the bond axis, locks the bond against rotation because rotation would disrupt this overlap. Option B invokes planarity, which is a consequence of $sp^2$ hybridization and $\\pi$ bonding, but planarity itself does not prevent rotation; the critical factor is the need to maintain parallel $p$-orbitals for the $\\pi$ bond. Option C attributes the barrier to the strength of the $\\sigma$ bond alone; however, $\\sigma$ bonds permit free rotation in single bonds, so $\\sigma$ bond strength is not the cause. Option D appeals to steric or electrostatic repulsion between substituents; such effects modulate relative stabilities but are not the fundamental source of the rotation barrier. Option E invokes trigonal planar geometry and steric hindrance; again, these are not the fundamental reason for restricted rotation.\n\nThus, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is given by Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1994910"}]}
