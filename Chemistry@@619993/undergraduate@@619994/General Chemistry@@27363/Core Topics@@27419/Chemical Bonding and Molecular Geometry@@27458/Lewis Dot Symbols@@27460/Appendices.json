To satisfy the octet rule for all atoms, the boron atom must form one double bond and two single bonds with the fluorine atoms. This arrangement results in a formal charge of 0 on the boron atom.\n\nB. The most stable Lewis structure for $BF_3$ contains a total of 26 valence electrons and features an expanded octet on the central boron atom.\n\nC.

The electronic structure of $BF_3$ must be described by three resonance structures to explain why all B-F bonds have a bond order of exactly 1.", "solution": "We first determine the total number of valence electrons in a $BF_{3}$ molecule. Boron contributes $3$ and each fluorine contributes $7$, giving\n$$3 + 3 \\times 7 = 24,$$\nso any statement claiming $26$ valence electrons is incorrect.\n\nThe standard formal charge expression is\n$$\\text{FC} = V - \\left(L + \\frac{B}{2}\\right),$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of valence electrons for the free atom, $L$ is the number of lone-pair electrons on the atom in the structure, and $B$ is the number of bonding electrons associated with that atom.\n\nConsider the Lewis structure with three B–F single bonds (no multiple bonds), which is the usual depiction for $BF_{3}$:\n- For boron: $V=3$, $L=0$, $B=6$, so\n$$\\text{FC}(B) = 3 - \\left(0 + \\frac{6}{2}\\right) = 3 - 3 = 0.$$\n- For each fluorine: $V=7$, $L=6$, $B=2$, so\n$$\\text{FC}(F) = 7 - \\left(6 + \\frac{2}{2}\\right) = 7 - (6 + 1) = 0.$$\nThus, in this structure the formal charge on every atom is $0$, but boron has only $6$ electrons in its valence shell (an incomplete octet). This establishes that the Lewis structure that minimizes the magnitude of formal charges has $\\text{FC}=0$ on all atoms, supporting statement C.\n\nNow test the idea of enforcing an octet on boron by introducing one B=F double bond (and two single bonds). Then:\n- For boron: $V=3$, $L=0$, $B=8$, so\n$$\\text{FC}(B) = 3 - \\left(0 + \\frac{8}{2}\\right) = 3 - 4 = -1.$$\n- For the double-bonded fluorine: $V=7$, $L=4$, $B=4$, so\n$$\\text{FC}(F_{\\text{double}}) = 7 - \\left(4 + \\frac{4}{2}\\right) = 7 - (4 + 2) = +1.$$\n- The single-bonded fluorines remain at $0$ formal charge.\nTherefore, enforcing an octet by adding a double bond introduces nonzero formal charges ($-1$ on B and $+1$ on one F), contradicting statement A (which claims $\\text{FC}(B)=0$) and showing that the formal-charge-minimizing structure is the all-single-bond structure, confirming statement C.\n\nNext, consider statement B. As shown above, the total number of valence electrons is $24$, not $26$. Moreover, boron (a second-period element) does not have an expanded octet in valid Lewis structures. Hence B is false.\n\nFor statement D, each B–F bond is polar due to the large electronegativity difference, but the molecular geometry is trigonal planar, and the three equal bond dipoles cancel vectorially, yielding a nonpolar molecule. The statement incorrectly asserts that the bonds are nonpolar because of cancellation; in reality the molecule is nonpolar while the bonds are polar. Thus D is false.\n\nFinally, for statement E, $BF_{3}$ is often discussed with resonance forms involving B=F multiple-bond character to rationalize partial $\\pi$ donation from F to the empty $p$ orbital on B. These resonance forms lead to an average bond order greater than $1$, not exactly $1$, and one does not require resonance solely to explain a bond order of exactly $1$.

Thus $\\text{FC}(N) = 5 - (3 + 2) = 0$. Electron count around N for the octet: $2 + 1 + 4 = 7$ (typical for a radical).\n- On O: $N_{nb} = 4$ (two pairs), $N_{b} = 4$. Thus $\\text{FC}(O) = 6 - (4 + 2) = 0$. Electron count around O: $4 + 4 = 8$ (octet satisfied).\nThis places the unpaired electron on the less electronegative atom (N) and has zero formal charges, which is favorable.\n\nOption B: N=O with N having two lone pairs; O having one lone pair and one unpaired electron.\n- On N: $N_{nb} = 4$, $N_{b} = 4$. $\\text{FC}(N) = 5 - (4 + 2) = -1$.\n- On O: $N_{nb} = 3$, $N_{b} = 4$. $\\text{FC}(O) = 6 - (3 + 2) = +1$.\nThis introduces charge separation with the more electronegative O bearing a positive formal charge and the unpaired electron on O, both unfavorable compared to A.\n\nOption C: N–O single bond with N having two lone pairs; O having two lone pairs and one unpaired electron.\n- On N: $N_{nb} = 4$, $N_{b} = 2$. $\\text{FC}(N) = 5 - (4 + 1) = 0$.

Octet around O: $4 + 1 + 2 = 7$.\nAlthough formal charges are zero, the nitrogen has only $6$ electrons around it, which is markedly unfavorable for a second-row atom compared to the $7$-electron radical case in A.\n\nOption D: N≡O triple bond with N having one lone pair; O having one lone pair and one unpaired electron.\n- On N: $N_{nb} = 2$, $N_{b} = 6$. $\\text{FC}(N) = 5 - (2 + 3) = 0$.\n- On O: $N_{nb} = 3$, $N_{b} = 6$. $\\text{FC}(O) = 6 - (3 + 3) = 0$.\nHowever, the octet at O would be exceeded: around O there would be $2 + 1 + 6 = 9$ electrons, which is not allowed for a second-period element.
