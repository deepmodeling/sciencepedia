In transport terms, we need $\\sigma_{\\text{solid}} \\approx 0$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{molten}}$ high. Using the general relation $\\sigma = q n \\mu$, the conductivity is high when there is a large density of mobile charge carriers $n$ with sufficient mobility $\\mu$. The key physical principle is:\n- Ionic solids: in the solid phase, ions are locked in a crystal lattice, so mobile charge carriers are absent ($n \\to 0$), yielding very low $\\sigma_{\\text{solid}}$; when molten, ions become mobile, so $n$ and $\\mu$ are large enough to give high $\\sigma_{\\text{molten}}$.\n- Metals: delocalized electrons in both solid and liquid phases yield high conductivity in both states.\n- Molecular covalent solids: discrete molecules with no mobile charges give low conductivity in both solid and liquid states; typically low melting points.\n- Network covalent solids: extended covalent bonding gives very high melting points and low conductivity in both states (unless there are special cases like graphite planes).\n\nEvaluate each substance against these criteria:\n- XA-1: High conductivity in the solid and in the molten state indicates metallic bonding. This fails the requirement $\\sigma_{\\text{solid}} \\approx 0$.\n- XB-2: Very low melting point and very low conductivity in both solid and molten states indicate a molecular covalent solid. This fails the requirement of high $\\sigma_{\\text{molten}}$.\n- XC-3: Extremely high melting point with very low conductivity in both states indicates a network covalent solid. This fails the requirement of high $\\sigma_{\\text{molten}}$.\n- XD-4: Very low conductivity as a solid but high conductivity when molten matches ionic behavior.
