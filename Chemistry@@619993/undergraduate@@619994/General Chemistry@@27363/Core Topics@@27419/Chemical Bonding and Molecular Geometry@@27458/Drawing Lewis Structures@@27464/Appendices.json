Xenon (Xe) is in Group 18, so it has 8 valence electrons. Oxygen (O) is in Group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\nTotal valence electrons = (Valence e⁻ of Xe) + 3 * (Valence e⁻ of O)\nTotal valence electrons = 8 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = 26 electrons.\n\nThe formula for formal charge (FC) is:\nFC = (Number of valence e⁻ in free atom) - (Number of non-bonding e⁻) - $\\frac{1}{2}$(Number of bonding e⁻)\n\n**Model A: The Octet-Compliant Model**\n\nIn this model, every atom must have exactly 8 electrons in its valence shell.\n1.  We start by placing the least electronegative atom, xenon, at the center, single-bonded to the three oxygen atoms. This uses $3 \\times 2 = 6$ bonding electrons.\n2.  The remaining electrons are $26 - 6 = 20$.\n3.  We distribute these electrons as lone pairs to the terminal oxygen atoms to satisfy their octets first. Each oxygen atom needs 6 more electrons (3 lone pairs) to complete its octet. This uses $3 \\times 6 = 18$ electrons.\n4.  The number of electrons remaining is $20 - 18 = 2$. These remaining 2 electrons are placed on the central xenon atom as a lone pair.\n5.  Now we check the octets. Each oxygen atom has 1 single bond (2 e⁻) and 3 lone pairs (6 e⁻), for a total of 8 electrons. The central xenon atom has 3 single bonds (6 e⁻) and 1 lone pair (2 e⁻), for a total of 8 electrons. All atoms satisfy the octet rule.\n6.

The octet-compliant model has a large positive formal charge on Xe (+3) and negative formal charges on all O atoms (-1). To reduce this charge separation, we can convert lone pairs from the oxygen atoms into additional bonds with the xenon atom. Since there are three oxygen atoms, we can form three double bonds to make the formal charges on all atoms as close to zero as possible.\n1.  The structure now consists of the central xenon atom double-bonded to each of the three oxygen atoms. The lone pair on xenon remains.\n2.  In this structure, each oxygen has one double bond (4 e⁻) and 2 lone pairs (4 e⁻), satisfying its octet.\n3.  The central xenon atom has 3 double bonds (a total of 12 bonding electrons) and 1 lone pair (2 non-bonding electrons). The total number of electrons in Xe's valence shell is $12 + 2 = 14$, which is an expanded octet.\n4.  The total electrons in the structure are 12 (in bonds) + 3 * 4 (lone pairs on O) + 2 (lone pair on Xe) = $12 + 12 + 2 = 26$, which is correct.\n5.
