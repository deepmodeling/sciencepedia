Before we can analyze the energy of an entire crystal lattice, we must understand its building blocks. This exercise challenges you to compare the radii of an isoelectronic series of ions, which illustrates how an increasing nuclear charge ($Z$) tightens its pull on a constant number of electrons, a crucial concept for understanding the interionic distance ($r$) that governs lattice energy.[@problem_id:2000763]", "problem": "Consider the following set of ions: $O^{2-}$, $F^{-}$, $Na^{+}$, and $Mg^{2+}$. These ions are all isoelectronic, meaning they possess the same number of electrons. Based on the principles of atomic structure and electrostatic interactions, determine the correct order of these ions by increasing ionic radius and the fundamental reason for this trend.\n\nSelect the option that provides both the correct ranking and the correct physical explanation.\n\nA) The ranking of increasing ionic radius is $Mg^{2+}$ < $Na^{+}$ < $F^{-}$ < $O^{2-}$. This is because as the nuclear charge increases across the series for a constant number of electrons, the electrostatic attraction on the electron cloud becomes stronger, pulling it closer to the nucleus.\n\nB) The ranking of increasing ionic radius is $O^{2-}$ < $F^{-}$ < $Na^{+}$ < $Mg^{2+}$. This is because as the nuclear charge increases across the series for a constant number of electrons, the electrostatic attraction on the electron cloud becomes stronger, pulling it closer to the nucleus.\n\nC) The ranking of increasing ionic radius is $Mg^{2+}$ < $Na^{+}$ < $F^{-}$ < $O^{2-}$. This is because anions gain electrons, which increases electron-electron repulsion and causes them to be larger than cations, which lose electrons.\n\nD) The ranking of increasing ionic radius is $F^{-}$ < $O^{2-}$ < $Na^{+}$ < $Mg^{2+}$. This trend is due to the fact that anions are generally larger than cations from different periods.\n\nE) The ranking of increasing ionic radius is $O^{2-}$ < $F^{-}$ < $Na^{+}$ < $Mg^{2+}$. This is because a more negative ion has greater electron-electron repulsion for a given nuclear charge, causing the electron cloud to expand.", "solution": "All four ions $O^{2-}$, $F^{-}$, $Na^{+}$, and $Mg^{2+}$ are isoelectronic with the same electron count. For an isoelectronic series, the dominant variable controlling ionic size is the nuclear charge $Z$. The electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electron cloud increases with the effective nuclear charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which, for a fixed electron configuration, increases as $Z$ increases because shielding is comparable across the series.\n\nA standard scaling argument uses the hydrogenic-like dependence of orbital size on effective nuclear charge: the characteristic radius satisfies\n$$\nr \\propto \\frac{1}{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}}.\n$$\nFor an isoelectronic series, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ increases monotonically with $Z$, so $r$ decreases as $Z$ increases.
