This practice challenges you to apply VSEPR theory to a set of common molecules, most of which possess highly symmetric geometries like tetrahedral or trigonal planar. By identifying the outlier that deviates from perfect symmetry, you will sharpen your ability to link molecular geometry to the presence of a net dipole moment.

You will see how a specific arrangement of lone pairs in a trigonal bipyramidal electron geometry can result in a highly symmetric, linear molecule.

Each iodine atom contributes $7$ valence electrons, and the extra negative charge adds $1$ electron, giving a total of $7\\times 3 + 1 = 22$ valence electrons.\n\nPlace three iodine atoms in a chain and form single bonds between the central iodine and the two terminal iodines. Each single bond uses $2$ electrons, so $2\\times 2 = 4$ electrons are used for bonding, leaving $22 - 4 = 18$ electrons to distribute as lone pairs.\n\nComplete octets on the terminal iodines: each terminal iodine needs $6$ nonbonding electrons to reach an octet (since each has one bond).

This matches the overall charge $-1$.\n\nDetermine electron-domain geometry using VSEPR. The central iodine has $2$ bonding pairs and $3$ lone pairs, so the steric number is $5$, corresponding to a trigonal bipyramidal electron-domain geometry. Lone pairs occupy equatorial positions to minimize repulsions, leaving the two bonding pairs in the axial positions. Therefore, the molecular geometry (positions of atoms) is linear.\n\nAssess polarity. The molecule is linear with identical terminal atoms, so the bond dipoles are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction along the same line and cancel.

For a molecule with the formula $PCl_2F_3$, atoms can be arranged differently in space, creating structural isomers with distinct properties.

The molecule is known to have a structure based on a trigonal bipyramidal electron geometry with the phosphorus atom at the center. This geometry has two distinct types of positions for the halogen atoms: two axial positions forming a linear F-P-F (or Cl-P-Cl, or F-P-Cl) axis, and three equatorial positions arranged in a triangle around the phosphorus atom, in a plane perpendicular to the axial axis.\n\nDifferent structural isomers of $PCl_2F_3$ can exist depending on the arrangement of the chlorine and fluorine atoms in the axial and equatorial positions. Assuming that fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, and that the individual bond dipoles are non-zero, determine which of the following descriptions corresponds to a nonpolar isomer (an isomer with a net molecular dipole moment of zero).\n\nA.

The net molecular dipole moment is the vector sum of all individual bond dipole moments. For a molecule to be nonpolar, this vector sum must be zero. The trigonal bipyramidal geometry ($AX_5$) has two axial positions and three equatorial positions. The vectors from the central atom to the three equatorial positions lie in a plane and are separated by 120 degrees. The vectors to the two axial positions are collinear and point in opposite directions.\n\nLet $\\vec{\\mu}_{P-F}$ be the bond dipole vector for the P-F bond and $\\vec{\\mu}_{P-Cl}$ be the bond dipole vector for the P-Cl bond. Since fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, the magnitude of the P-F bond dipole is greater than the magnitude of the P-Cl bond dipole, i.e., $|\\vec{\\mu}_{P-F}| > |\\vec{\\mu}_{P-Cl}|$. Both vectors point from the less electronegative phosphorus atom towards the more electronegative halogen atom.\n\nWe will now analyze each of the three possible structural isomers described:\n\nCase C: Both chlorine atoms occupy axial positions.\nIn this arrangement, the two chlorine atoms are in the axial positions, and the three fluorine atoms occupy the three equatorial positions.\nThe two P-Cl bond dipoles are directed along the same axis but in opposite directions. Since their magnitudes are identical, their vector sum is zero: $\\vec{\\mu}_{P-Cl} + (-\\vec{\\mu}_{P-Cl}) = \\vec{0}$.\nThe three P-F bond dipoles lie in the equatorial plane, separated by 120 degrees from each other. They have equal magnitudes. The vector sum of three equal vectors separated by 120 degrees in a plane is zero.\nSince the net dipole moment from the axial bonds is zero and the net dipole moment from the equatorial bonds is zero, the total molecular dipole moment is zero. Therefore, this isomer is nonpolar.\n\nCase B: Both chlorine atoms occupy equatorial positions.\nIn this arrangement, two chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom occupy the three equatorial positions. The two remaining fluorine atoms occupy the axial positions.\nLet's first consider the axial bonds. The two P-F bond dipoles are in opposite directions and have the same magnitude. Thus, they cancel each other out, and the net dipole from the axial positions is zero.\nNow, consider the equatorial plane. There are two P-Cl bond dipoles and one P-F bond dipole, all separated by 120 degrees. Let the P-F dipole point along the positive y-axis. The two P-Cl dipoles will be at an angle of 120 degrees and 240 degrees with respect to the P-F dipole. The vector sum of these three dipoles is not zero because the magnitudes of the P-Cl and P-F dipoles are different ($|\\vec{\\mu}_{P-F}| > |\\vec{\\mu}_{P-Cl}|$). The symmetry required for cancellation is broken. Therefore, this isomer is polar.\n\nCase A: One chlorine atom is axial, and the other is equatorial.\nIn this arrangement, one axial position is occupied by a chlorine atom, and the other by a fluorine atom. The equatorial positions are occupied by one chlorine atom and two fluorine atoms.\nLet's consider the axial bonds first. We have a P-Cl bond and a P-F bond oriented in opposite directions. Since $|\\vec{\\mu}_{P-F}| \\neq |\\vec{\\mu}_{P-Cl}|$, their vector sum is non-zero. There is a net axial dipole moment.\nSimilarly, in the equatorial plane, we have one P-Cl dipole and two P-F dipoles. This arrangement is also asymmetric, and their vector sum will be non-zero.\nSince both the axial and equatorial components of the dipole moment are non-zero, the overall molecule is definitely polar.\n\nBased on this analysis, only the isomer where both chlorine atoms are in the axial positions is nonpolar.
