The central carbon atom in the carbonate ion has one non-bonding electron pair.\n\nB. The carbonate ion has a total of 24 valence electrons available for bonding.\n\nC. In any single valid resonance structure of the carbonate ion, the formal charge on the central carbon atom is +1.\n\nD.

Carbon contributes $4$, each oxygen contributes $6$, and the $2-$ charge adds $2$ more electrons. Therefore,\n$$\n\\text{Total valence electrons} = 4 + 3 \\times 6 + 2 = 24,\n$$\nso statement B is correct.\n\nConstructing a valid Lewis structure, carbon is central with three oxygen atoms bonded in a trigonal planar arrangement. The three equivalent resonance structures each have one $\\text{C}=\\text{O}$ double bond and two $\\text{C}-\\text{O}^{-}$ single bonds, with the negative charges residing on the singly bonded oxygens.

By calculating the average bond order for each ion, you can directly predict which will have longer nitrogen-oxygen bonds, connecting a theoretical concept to a physically measurable property.", "problem": "Consider the nitrate ion, $NO_3^-$, and the nitrite ion, $NO_2^-$. Both ions exhibit resonance, meaning that the true electronic structure is a hybrid of multiple valid Lewis structures. As a result, all the nitrogen-oxygen (N-O) bonds within a given ion are identical in length and strength. Which of the following statements correctly compares the average N-O bond length in nitrate versus nitrite and provides the correct underlying chemical justification?\n\nA. The N-O bonds in $NO_3^-$ are shorter than in $NO_2^-$ because the negative charge is delocalized over more oxygen atoms in $NO_3^-$, leading to stronger bonds.\n\nB. The N-O bonds in $NO_2^-$ are longer than in $NO_3^-$ because the lone pair on the central nitrogen atom in $NO_2^-$ exerts strong repulsion, weakening the N-O bonds.\n\nC. The N-O bonds in $NO_3^-$ are longer than in $NO_2^-$ because the N-O bond order in $NO_3^-$ is lower than the N-O bond order in $NO_2^-$.\n\nD. The N-O bond lengths are identical in both ions because in both cases, the bonds are an average of an N-O single bond and an N-O double bond.\n\nE. The N-O bonds in $NO_3^-$ are longer than in $NO_2^-$ because of the greater steric hindrance from three oxygen atoms compared to two, which forces the bonds to lengthen.", "solution": "We use the principle that, for a given pair of atoms, a higher bond order corresponds to a shorter and stronger bond, while a lower bond order corresponds to a longer and weaker bond.\n\nFor $NO_{3}^{-}$, there are three equivalent resonance structures.

The bicyclic amide known as quinuclidone presents a fascinating chemical puzzle where the expected amide resonance is \"switched off\" due to its rigid structure. This advanced problem [@problem_id:2197330] challenges you to think beyond 2D drawings and consider the geometric requirements for orbital overlap, providing a deeper understanding of why resonance occurs—and why it sometimes cannot.", "problem": "The standard model of an amide functional group involves significant resonance delocalization, where the nitrogen lone pair interacts with the carbonyl pi system. This delocalization imparts partial double-bond character to the C-N bond, making it shorter and stronger than a typical amine C-N single bond, and results in a planar geometry about the amide group.\n\nConsider the bicyclic amide 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, commonly known as quinuclidone. When protonated or converted to a quaternary ammonium salt, this molecule exhibits properties that are strikingly different from a typical acyclic amide like N,N-dimethylacetamide. Experimental observations show that in salts of quinuclidone, the C-N amide bond is significantly longer and undergoes hydrolysis under mild conditions much more rapidly than a typical amide. Furthermore, its carbonyl group C=O exhibits an infrared (IR) stretching frequency closer to that of a simple ketone (~$1750 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$) rather than a typical tertiary amide (~$1650 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental and accurate explanation for the unusual chemical and spectroscopic properties of the amide linkage in salts of 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one?\n\nA. The inductive effect of the bicyclic cage structure electronically destabilizes the C-N bond by pulling electron density away from the nitrogen atom, thus weakening it irrespective of resonance.\n\nB. The bridgehead nitrogen atom is sterically hindered, preventing the planarization required for effective resonance and simultaneously increasing ground-state strain on the C-N bond.\n\nC. The rigid geometry of the 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane skeleton forces the nitrogen atom's lone pair orbital to be nearly orthogonal to the pi system of the adjacent carbonyl group, thereby preventing resonance delocalization.\n\nD. The positive charge on the quaternary nitrogen in the salt form enhances the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon to an extreme degree, making the C-N bond kinetically labile to hydrolysis without altering its intrinsic bond character.\n\nE. The C-N bond is part of a strained six-membered ring, and its rapid cleavage is primarily driven by the release of this ring strain, a factor that outweighs any electronic effects from resonance or induction.", "solution": "Amide stabilization arises from resonance between a neutral structure with a C=O double bond and a zwitterionic structure in which the nitrogen donates its lone pair into the carbonyl $\\pi$ system. This $n_{N} \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}_{C=O}$ donation requires effective orbital overlap, which in turn requires the nitrogen to be nearly planar ($sp^{2}$-like) and its lone pair to be aligned in a $p$ orbital coplanar with the carbonyl $\\pi$ system. When this overlap is efficient, the C–N bond gains partial double-bond character and shortens, while the C=O bond loses double-bond character, decreasing its force constant $k$ and therefore lowering the IR stretching frequency $v$ according to $v \\propto \\sqrt{k/\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the reduced mass. This is why typical tertiary amides show $v_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$ near $1650\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and have shortened C–N bonds.\n\nIn 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one (quinuclidone), the bridgehead nitrogen is locked by the rigid bicyclic framework into a strongly pyramidal geometry and cannot achieve the planarization required for the lone pair to occupy a $p$ orbital aligned with the carbonyl $\\pi$ system. Geometrically, the lone pair orbital is forced to be nearly orthogonal to the carbonyl $\\pi$ system, so the key $n_{N} \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}_{C=O}$ interaction is suppressed. With resonance delocalization prevented, the C–N bond is essentially a localized $sp^{3}$–$sp^{2}$ single bond, which lengthens and weakens relative to a typical amide, and the carbonyl behaves like a ketone, with a larger force constant and therefore a higher $v_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$ approaching that of a simple ketone.\n\nThese electronic consequences directly explain all the observations for quinuclidone salts: a significantly longer C–N bond, a $v_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$ closer to a ketone, and rapid hydrolysis. In the protonated or quaternized forms, there is no $n_{N}$ to donate at all, so resonance is absent; however, even in the neutral scaffold the rigid topology already suppresses donation by enforcing orthogonality. The salt form further renders nitrogen a better leaving group, increasing hydrolytic lability, but the fundamental cause of the unusual spectroscopic and bonding features remains the geometric prohibition of $n_{N} \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}_{C=O}$ overlap.\n\nAssessment of the options:\n- A is incorrect because an inductive effect from the cage is not the primary factor and cannot by itself account for the dramatic loss of amide character and the ketone-like IR frequency; resonance suppression dominates.\n- B is misleading: the issue is not generic steric hindrance by bulky groups but the enforced topology that prevents planarity and orbital alignment; invoking increased ground-state strain on the C–N bond is secondary and not the fundamental explanation.\n- C is correct because it identifies the decisive factor: the rigid skeleton forces the nitrogen lone pair orbital to be nearly orthogonal to the carbonyl $\\pi$ system, preventing resonance delocalization and thereby producing a long, weak C–N bond and a ketone-like C=O stretch.\n- D is incomplete and not fundamental: while positive charge increases electrophilicity in any protonated amide, it does not uniquely explain the ketone-like IR or the unusually long C–N bond; without resonance suppression, typical protonated amides still retain some amide character.\n- E is incorrect: a six-membered ring is not intrinsically highly strained, and ring-strain release does not primarily drive the observed reactivity; the key effect is electronic, namely the loss of resonance.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental and accurate explanation is the enforced orthogonality that prevents $n_{N} \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}_{C=O}$ conjugation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2197330"}]}
