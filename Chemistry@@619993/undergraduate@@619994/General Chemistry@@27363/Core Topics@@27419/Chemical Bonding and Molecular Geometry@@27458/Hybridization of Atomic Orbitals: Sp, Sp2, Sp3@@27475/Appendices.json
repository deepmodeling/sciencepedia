This exercise provides practice in applying the concept of steric number—the sum of sigma bonds and lone pairs—to deduce the hybridization state ($sp$, $sp^2$, or $sp^3$) of carbon atoms involved in single, double, and triple bonds. Mastering this skill is the first step toward visualizing molecular architecture [@problem_id:1998210].", "problem": "Consider the organic molecule pent-1-en-4-yne, which has the chemical formula $C_5H_6$.

All other carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds. The carbon atoms are numbered sequentially from $C_1$ to $C_5$, starting from the end of the chain with the double bond, such that the structure can be represented as $C_1H_2=C_2H-C_3H_2-C_4 \\equiv C_5H$.\n\nAccording to Valence Bond Theory and the concept of orbital hybridization, what are the hybridization states of the carbon atoms $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$, respectively?\n\nA) $sp^2, sp^3, sp$\n\nB) $sp^2, sp^2, sp$\n\nC) $sp, sp^2, sp^3$\n\nD) $sp^3, sp^2, sp$\n\nE) $sp^2, sp^3, sp^2$", "solution": "We analyze hybridization using Valence Bond Theory, where the hybridization of a carbon atom is determined by its steric number, defined as the total number of sigma bonds plus lone pairs.
