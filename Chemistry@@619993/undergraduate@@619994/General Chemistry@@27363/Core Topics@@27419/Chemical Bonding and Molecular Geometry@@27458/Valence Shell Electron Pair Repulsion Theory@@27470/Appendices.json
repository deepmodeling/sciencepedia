For a molecule with formula $AX_4$ and all $X$ identical, the possibilities that keep four $A-X$ bonds are:\n1) Four total domains: $AX_4E_0$ gives a tetrahedral electron-domain geometry and a tetrahedral molecular geometry. With four identical $X$ at the vertices of a tetrahedron, the bond dipoles cancel by symmetry, giving zero net dipole. Thus a tetrahedral $AX_4$ with no lone pairs is nonpolar, so option A cannot produce the observed polarity.\n2) Five total domains: $AX_4E_1$ gives a trigonal bipyramidal electron-domain geometry with one lone pair. VSEPR places the lone pair equatorial to minimize repulsions, yielding a seesaw molecular geometry. In this geometry, the two axial and two equatorial $A-X$ bonds are not symmetrically disposed so that their dipoles cancel; instead, the vector sum of the identical $A-X$ bond dipoles is nonzero. This produces a permanent dipole moment, as exemplified by $SF_4$. Therefore, trigonal bipyramidal with one lone pair yields a polar $AX_4$, matching option B.\n3) Six total domains: $AX_4E_2$ gives an octahedral electron-domain geometry with two lone pairs. VSEPR places the two lone pairs opposite each other, producing a square planar molecular geometry. With four identical $X$ in a square plane, opposite bond dipoles cancel pairwise, giving zero net dipole.

Option E is false because an $AX_4$ molecule can be polar when the electron-domain geometry is trigonal bipyramidal with one lone pair (e.g., $SF_4$).\n\nTherefore, the only description that yields a polar $AX_4$ with identical $X$ is trigonal bipyramidal electron-domain geometry with one lone pair on $A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2027556"}]}
