While this rule is a powerful predictor of bonding for many common compounds, several classes of molecules and ions are known exceptions. Consider the methyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{CH}_3$), a highly reactive, transient species that plays a crucial role in various chemical reactions, including combustion and atmospheric chemistry.\n\nBased on the principles of Lewis structures and electronic configuration, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete description of the methyl radical?\n\nA. The methyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{CH}_3$) has 8 valence electrons, and the central carbon atom satisfies the octet rule.\n\nB. The methyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{CH}_3$) has 7 valence electrons, and the central carbon atom has an expanded octet with 9 electrons.\n\nC. The methyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{CH}_3$) is classified as an odd-electron species because it contains a total of 7 valence electrons, and the central carbon atom has an incomplete octet.\n\nD. In the Lewis structure for the methyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{CH}_3$), the carbon atom forms a double bond with one hydrogen atom to satisfy its octet.\n\nE. The methyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{CH}_3$) is a stable molecule because the central carbon atom has a formal charge of zero.", "solution": "We determine the total valence electron count using Lewis structure principles:\n- Carbon contributes $4$ valence electrons.\n- Each hydrogen contributes $1$ valence electron; with three hydrogens, this is $3$ electrons.\nTherefore, the total for $\\cdot\\text{CH}_3$ is $4+3=7$ electrons. Since $7$ is odd, $\\cdot\\text{CH}_3$ is an odd-electron (radical) species.\n\nConstructing the Lewis structure, carbon is central and forms three $C{-}H$ single bonds. These bonds account for $3$ electron pairs, i.e., $6$ electrons in bonding. The remaining $1$ electron is unpaired and is localized on carbon. Counting electrons around carbon, there are $6$ shared (in three bonds) plus $1$ unpaired, totaling $7$ electrons around carbon, which is an incomplete octet. Carbon does not have access to low-lying $d$ orbitals in the second period, so it cannot have an expanded octet.\n\nCompute the formal charge on carbon to check internal consistency:\n$$\n\\text{FC}(\\text{C}) = V - \\left(N + \\frac{B}{2}\\right) = 4 - \\left(1 + \\frac{6}{2}\\right) = 4 - (1+3) = 0\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the valence of carbon, $N$ is the number of nonbonding electrons on carbon (here $1$), and $B$ is the number of bonding electrons around carbon (here $6$).

To understand its electronic structure, chemists often draw Lewis structures. For $XeO_3$, two primary models are considered. The first model, which we will call Structure A, is constructed such that every atom in the molecule strictly satisfies the octet rule. The second model, Structure B, is derived by adjusting Structure A to achieve the most stable arrangement based on formal charge, which involves minimizing the magnitude of formal charges on all atoms. This often requires the central atom to possess an expanded octet.\n\nLet $S_A$ be the sum of the absolute values of the formal charges on all individual atoms in Structure A.

The ability to form an expanded octet is not universal and depends critically on an element's position in the periodic table. This final thought experiment uses a series of hypothetical noble gas compounds to test your understanding of these boundaries, specifically why a Period 2 element like Neon cannot be hypervalent while its heavier congeners can. [@problem_id:1993962]", "problem": "In the field of inorganic chemistry, scientists often explore the possibility of synthesizing novel compounds by considering the electronic structures of elements.

Your task is to analyze the plausibility of these molecules based on the principles of chemical bonding and the octet rule.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate chemical reasoning regarding these hypothetical molecules?\n\nA. $NeH_2$ is a stable molecule because Neon can accommodate an expanded octet, leading to a linear geometry with two bonding pairs and three lone pairs of electrons.\n\nB.

However, $NeH_2$ is not plausible because Neon, being a Period 2 element, lacks accessible d-orbitals for valence shell expansion.\n\nD. The stability of these molecules is primarily determined by minimizing formal charges. In $NeH_2$, a Lewis structure can be drawn where the Neon atom has a formal charge of zero and obeys the octet rule, making it a plausible molecule.\n\nE. The formation of $NeH_2$ is analogous to the formation of molecules like $BeH_2$. Both Neon and Beryllium can promote a valence electron to a higher energy p-orbital to form two bonds, resulting in a stable linear molecule.", "solution": "We analyze the plausibility of $HeH_2$, $NeH_2$, $ArH_2$, and $KrH_2$ using the octet (or duet) rule, formal charge minimization, and basic VSEPR reasoning for central-atom electron pair counts.\n\nPrinciples used:\n- Duet rule for period 1 helium: a stable helium valence shell contains $2$ electrons; exceeding a duet is not reasonable.\n- Octet rule for period 2 (e.g., Neon): a stable valence shell contains $8$ electrons; period 2 atoms cannot exceed an octet.\n- Hypervalency for period 3 and beyond (e.g., Argon, Krypton): compounds with central atoms accommodating more than $8$ electrons are well documented; the older d-orbital rationale is historically taught but modern bonding descriptions invoke multi-center bonding rather than literal valence d-orbital participation.\n- Formal charge computation: for any atom, $FC = V - \\left(N + \\frac{B}{2}\\right)$, where $V$ is the number of valence electrons of the free atom, $N$ is the number of nonbonding electrons assigned to the atom in the structure, and $B$ is the number of bonding electrons around that atom.\n- VSEPR electron-domain counting: a central atom with two bonding pairs and three lone pairs ($AX_2E_3$) is linear and is seen in known hypervalent species like $XeF_2$.\n\nEvaluate each molecule and option:\n\n1) $HeH_2$: Helium has a filled $1s^2$ valence shell (duet). A Lewis structure with He as the central atom and two single bonds to H would place $4$ electrons around He, exceeding the duet. Even though the formal charge could be computed as $FC_{\\text{He}} = 2 - \\left(0 + \\frac{4}{2}\\right) = 0$, violating the duet rule for He makes such a structure chemically implausible. Helium’s closed-shell nature and lack of accessible low-energy orbitals make stable covalent bonding in neutral $HeH_2$ not plausible.\n\n2) $NeH_2$: Neon is period 2 with $V=8$. Consider two possible Lewis assignments:\n- Two single bonds and two lone pairs on Ne (to obey the octet). Here $N=4$ and $B=4$ around Ne, so $FC_{\\text{Ne}} = 8 - \\left(4 + \\frac{4}{2}\\right) = 8 - (4 + 2) = +2$, which is highly unfavorable.\n- Two single bonds and three lone pairs on Ne (to achieve $FC_{\\text{Ne}}=0$). Then $N=6$ and $B=4$, giving $FC_{\\text{Ne}} = 8 - \\left(6 + 2\\right) = 0$, but this requires $10$ electrons around Ne, exceeding the octet. Because period 2 atoms cannot expand the octet, $NeH_2$ cannot simultaneously satisfy an octet and minimize formal charge. Thus $NeH_2$ is not plausible by octet-rule and formal-charge criteria.\n\n3) $ArH_2$ and $KrH_2$: Argon and Krypton (periods 3 and 4) can exist in hypervalent environments. A Lewis structure with two single bonds to H and three lone pairs on the central atom gives $N=6$ and $B=4$, so $FC_{\\text{Ar/Kr}} = 8 - (6 + 2) = 0$ on the noble gas and $FC_{\\text{H}}=0$ on each hydrogen. This is an $AX_2E_3$ set of electron domains, which VSEPR predicts to be linear. While actual thermodynamic stability is a separate question, such bonding is at least plausible in principle for heavier noble gases, consistent with known hypervalent noble-gas chemistry (e.g., krypton and xenon fluorides). The traditional explanation invokes the availability of d-orbitals for “octet expansion,” although modern descriptions emphasize multi-center bonding rather than literal d-orbital participation.\n\nNow evaluate the statements:\n\nA. Claims $NeH_2$ is stable because Neon can expand its octet to accommodate two bonds and three lone pairs. This is incorrect: period 2 elements cannot exceed an octet, and $NeH_2$ cannot satisfy both octet and favorable formal charges.\n\nB. Claims all listed dihydrides are unstable because noble gases cannot form covalent bonds under any circumstances. This is false; heavier noble gases do form covalent compounds (e.g., $KrF_2$, $XeF_2$), so the absolute claim is incorrect.\n\nC. Claims $ArH_2$ and $KrH_2$ are plausible in principle due to octet expansion via empty valence d-orbitals, whereas $NeH_2$ is not plausible because Neon lacks accessible d-orbitals. While the specific “d-orbital” rationale is an oversimplification in modern bonding theory, the overall chemical reasoning and conclusion align with octet-rule expectations: period 3 and beyond can be hypervalent and period 2 cannot. Among the given choices, this gives the most chemically defensible assessment of plausibility.\n\nD. Claims $NeH_2$ can be drawn with Neon having formal charge zero and obeying the octet rule. As shown, with two bonds and octet compliance, $FC_{\\text{Ne}}=+2$; to have $FC_{\\text{Ne}}=0$ requires exceeding the octet. This is incorrect.\n\nE. Analogizes $NeH_2$ formation to $BeH_2$. This is incorrect: beryllium can form two bonds via hybridization after promoting an electron from $2s$ to $2p$, but neon already has a closed-shell $2s^22p^6$ configuration; “promotion” would not create a favorable bonding situation and period 2 neon cannot expand its octet.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate reasoning among the options is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1993962"}]}
