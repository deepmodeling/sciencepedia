It forms sigma bonds to three hydrogens and to $C_B$, for a total of four sigma bonds and no lone pairs. Four electron domains imply tetrahedral geometry, so $C_A$ adopts $sp^3$ hybridization.

In forming the adduct $F_3B-NH_3$, the nitrogen donates this lone pair into the vacant $p$ orbital (acceptor orbital) on boron, establishing a coordinate (dative) covalent bond.
