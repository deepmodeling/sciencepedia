This practice challenges you to apply this skill to the isoelectronic species carbon monoxide ($CO$) and the cyanide ion ($CN^-$). By carefully calculating and comparing formal charges, you will explore a classic case where satisfying the octet rule takes precedence over placing a negative formal charge on the most electronegative atom, deepening your understanding of the hierarchy of rules in bonding theory [@problem_id:1987109].", "problem": "In theoretical chemistry, the concept of isoelectronic species—molecules or ions that have the same number of valence electrons and similar Lewis structures—provides a powerful tool for comparing and understanding chemical bonding. Consider two such species: the neutral carbon monoxide ($CO$) molecule and the cyanide anion ($CN^-$).\n\nYour task is to determine the most stable Lewis structure for each of these species. The stability of a Lewis structure is primarily determined by two rules, in order of importance:\n1. The structure should satisfy the octet rule for as many atoms as possible.\n2. The structure should minimize the magnitude of the formal charge on each atom.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the number of valence electrons are 4 for Carbon (C), 5 for Nitrogen (N), and 6 for Oxygen (O).\n\nLet the quantity $S$ be defined as the sum of the absolute values of the formal charges on all atoms within the most stable Lewis structure of a given species. Calculate the value of $S$ for carbon monoxide, denoted as $S_{CO}$, and for the cyanide ion, denoted as $S_{CN^-}$.\n\nPresent your final answer as a row matrix containing the two integer values in the order ($S_{CO}, S_{CN^-}$).", "solution": "The problem asks us to find the sum of the absolute values of formal charges ($S$) for the most stable Lewis structures of carbon monoxide ($CO$) and the cyanide ion ($CN^-$). To do this, we must first determine the most stable Lewis structure for each species by considering valence electrons, the octet rule, and formal charges.\n\nThe formula for formal charge (FC) is:\n$$ \\text{FC} = (\\text{Number of valence electrons}) - (\\text{Number of non-bonding electrons}) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Number of bonding electrons}) $$\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of Carbon Monoxide ($CO$)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of valence electrons for $CO$.\nTotal valence electrons = (Valence e⁻ of C) + (Valence e⁻ of O) = $4 + 6 = 10$.\n\nWe need to arrange these 10 electrons to satisfy the octet rule for both atoms. Let's consider a structure with a triple bond, as this is a common arrangement for diatomic species with 10 valence electrons.\n\nThe structure is $:C \\equiv O:$.\nLet's check the octet rule for this structure.\n- Carbon atom: Has 1 lone pair (2 electrons) and 3 bonds (6 electrons). Total = $2 + 6 = 8$ electrons. The octet is satisfied.\n- Oxygen atom: Has 1 lone pair (2 electrons) and 3 bonds (6 electrons). Total = $2 + 6 = 8$ electrons. The octet is satisfied.\n\nSince the octet rule is satisfied for both atoms, we now calculate the formal charges to assess stability.\n- Formal Charge on Carbon ($FC_C$):\n  $FC_C$ = $4 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = 4 - 2 - 3 = -1$.\n- Formal Charge on Oxygen ($FC_O$):\n  $FC_O$ = $6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = 6 - 2 - 3 = +1$.\n\nThe sum of the formal charges is $-1 + 1 = 0$, which correctly matches the neutral charge of the molecule. Other resonance structures, such as one with a double bond ($:C=O:$ with appropriate lone pairs), would either violate the octet rule for carbon or result in larger formal charges (e.g., FC_C = 0, FC_O = 0 but C has only 6 electrons), making them less stable. Therefore, the triple-bonded structure is the most stable Lewis structure for $CO$.\n\nNow, we calculate $S_{CO}$, the sum of the absolute values of the formal charges.\n$S_{CO} = |FC_C| + |FC_O| = |-1| + |+1| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of the Cyanide Ion ($CN^-$)**\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of valence electrons for $CN^-$.\nTotal valence electrons = (Valence e⁻ of C) + (Valence e⁻ of N) + (Charge) = $4 + 5 + 1 = 10$.\n\n$CN^-$ is isoelectronic with $CO$, so we can anticipate a similar triple-bonded structure.\nThe structure is $[:C \\equiv N:]^{-}$.\nLet's check the octet rule for this structure.\n- Carbon atom: Has 1 lone pair (2 electrons) and 3 bonds (6 electrons). Total = $2 + 6 = 8$ electrons. The octet is satisfied.\n- Nitrogen atom: Has 1 lone pair (2 electrons) and 3 bonds (6 electrons). Total = $2 + 6 = 8$ electrons. The octet is satisfied.\n\nNow we calculate the formal charges for this structure.\n- Formal Charge on Carbon ($FC_C$):\n  $FC_C$ = $4 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = 4 - 2 - 3 = -1$.\n- Formal Charge on Nitrogen ($FC_N$):\n  $FC_N$ = $5 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = 5 - 2 - 3 = 0$.\n\nThe sum of the formal charges is $-1 + 0 = -1$, which correctly matches the charge of the ion. This structure satisfies the octet rule for both atoms and has minimal formal charges (magnitudes of 1 and 0). Any other structure would either violate the octet rule or lead to larger formal charges, making it less stable. Therefore, this is the most stable Lewis structure for $CN^-$.\n\nNow, we calculate $S_{CN^-}$, the sum of the absolute values of the formal charges.\n$S_{CN^-} = |FC_C| + |FC_N| = |-1| + |0| = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that for the most stable Lewis structures:\n- $S_{CO} = 2$\n- $S_{CN^-} = 1$\n\nThe question asks for the answer as a row matrix ($S_{CO}, S_{CN^-}$).\nThe final answer is $(2, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "1987109"}, {"introduction": "While the octet rule is a powerful guide, its application becomes more nuanced for elements in the third period and beyond.
