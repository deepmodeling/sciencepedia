Different metal carbides can feature carbon in various forms, from isolated atoms to chains and complex cage structures, leading to different oxidation states for the carbon atoms.\n\nConsider the following three ionic carbides: calcium carbide ($CaC_2$), aluminum carbide ($Al_4C_3$), and a specific form of magnesium carbide ($Mg_2C_3$). In these compounds, the metals adopt their most common and stable oxidation states as cations. Your task is to determine the oxidation number of the carbon atoms within the respective carbide anions formed in each compound. For any carbide anion containing more than one carbon atom, you should determine the *average* oxidation state of carbon.\n\nProvide the three oxidation numbers in a sequence corresponding to the compounds $CaC_2$, $Al_4C_3$, and $Mg_2C_3$, in that specific order.", "solution": "We use oxidation-state accounting with the rule that the sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is zero.
