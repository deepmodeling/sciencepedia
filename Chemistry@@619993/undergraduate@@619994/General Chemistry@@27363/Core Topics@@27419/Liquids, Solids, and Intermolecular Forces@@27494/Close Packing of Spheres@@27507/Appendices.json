In this arrangement, the metal atoms can be modeled as identical hard spheres of radius $R$. This packing results in the formation of specific types of voids.

Their coordinates can be represented as $(\\pm L, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\pm L, 0)$, and $(0, 0, \\pm L)$ for some distance $L$.\n\nThe problem states that the host atoms are part of a close-packed structure. This means that adjacent atoms are in contact. Let's consider two adjacent host atoms, for example, the one centered at $A = (L, 0, 0)$ and the one centered at $B = (0, L, 0)$. The distance, $d_{AB}$, between their centers can be calculated using the distance formula in three dimensions:\n$$d_{AB} = \\sqrt{(L-0)^{2} + (0-L)^{2} + (0-0)^{2}} = \\sqrt{L^{2} + L^{2}} = \\sqrt{2L^{2}} = L\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nSince these two host atoms are touching, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum of their radii, which is $R + R = 2R$.\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n$$L\\sqrt{2} = 2R$$\n\nSolving for $L$, we find the distance from the center of the void to the center of any of the surrounding host atoms:\n$$L = \\frac{2R}{\\sqrt{2}} = R\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the interstitial atom, modeled as a sphere of maximum radius $r = r_{max}$, placed at the center of the void (the origin).

The distance between the center of the interstitial atom (at the origin) and the center of this host atom is simply $L$.\n\nThis distance must also be equal to the sum of the radius of the interstitial atom, $r$, and the radius of the host atom, $R$.\nSo, we have the relationship:\n$$L = r + R$$\n\nWe now have two expressions for $L$.
