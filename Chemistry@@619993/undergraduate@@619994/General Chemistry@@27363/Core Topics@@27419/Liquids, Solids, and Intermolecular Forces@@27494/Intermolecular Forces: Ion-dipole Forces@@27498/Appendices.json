The experiment involves dissolving lithium perchlorate ($LiClO_4$), an ionic salt, in acetone ($(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CO}$). The carbonyl group (C=O) in acetone exhibits a characteristic vibrational stretching frequency, which can be measured using infrared spectroscopy. The vibrational frequency, expressed as a wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$, can be modeled by treating the bond as a simple harmonic oscillator, for which the wavenumber is given by:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light, $k$ is the force constant of the bond (a measure of its stiffness and strength), and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two atoms forming the bond.\n\nIn pure liquid acetone, the C=O stretching frequency is observed at approximately 1715 cm⁻¹.

The frequency remains unchanged because the interaction between the ions and the solvent is a weak intermolecular force that does not affect the strong covalent C=O bond.\n\nD. The frequency decreases because the effective mass of the oscillator increases due to the association of the C=O group with the heavier $Li^+$ ion.\n\nE.

Upon dissolving $LiClO_{4}$ in acetone, the $Li^{+}$ ion acts as a Lewis acid and coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen, which donates electron density from its lone pairs to $Li^{+}$. This coordination withdraws electron density from the oxygen and stabilizes the resonance form with greater $C^{+}-O^{-}$ character, thereby reducing the $\\pi$ bond character between C and O. A reduction in bond order weakens and lengthens the C=O bond, which decreases the force constant $k$.\n\nSince the atomic masses of C and O do not change, the reduced mass $\\mu$ remains effectively constant for the C=O stretching mode.

The alternative explanations are inconsistent: the reduced mass for the C=O oscillator does not include $Li^{+}$ (contradicting D), the interaction is not negligible (contradicting C), $Li^{+}$ coordination does not strengthen the C=O bond (contradicting B), and $ClO_{4}^{-}$ is weakly coordinating and not the primary cause of any increase (contradicting E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1999418"}]}
