This exercise [@problem_id:1999702] provides a quantitative look at why the boiling point increases significantly from Argon to Krypton, highlighting how the dramatic increase in polarizability more than compensates for the slight decrease in ionization energy.", "problem": "The boiling points of the noble gases increase down the group, a trend primarily governed by the strength of London dispersion forces. The London approximation provides a semi-quantitative model for the dispersion interaction energy, $E_{disp}$, between two identical nonpolar atoms.

In such cases, molecular shape becomes a critical factor in determining the strength of London dispersion forces. This practice [@problem_id:1999663] explores two isomers of pentane to demonstrate how an elongated structure allows for a larger surface area for intermolecular contact compared to a compact, spherical one. This difference in available surface area leads to stronger overall attractions and, consequently, a higher surface tension.", "problem": "Consider two isomers of pentane, which share the molecular formula $\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_{12}$: n-pentane (pentane) and neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane). Both substances are nonpolar liquids at room temperature. The dominant Intermolecular Force (IMF) for both is the London dispersion force. Surface tension is a property of liquids that arises from the cohesive forces between molecules. A stronger set of net intermolecular forces within a liquid typically corresponds to a higher surface tension.\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces, predict the relative surface tensions of these two liquids and select the statement that provides the correct reasoning.\n\nA. Neopentane will have a higher surface tension because its symmetric, spherical shape allows for more efficient packing in the liquid state, maximizing intermolecular attractions.\n\nB. n-Pentane will have a higher surface tension because its linear structure gives it a permanent dipole moment, unlike the nonpolar neopentane, leading to stronger dipole-dipole forces.\n\nC. Both isomers will have nearly identical surface tensions because they have the same molar mass and number of electrons, resulting in London dispersion forces of equal magnitude.\n\nD. n-Pentane will have a higher surface tension because its elongated, cylindrical shape provides a larger surface area for intermolecular contact, resulting in stronger overall London dispersion forces.\n\nE. Neopentane will have a higher surface tension because as a more branched alkane, it has a higher polarizability than its straight-chain isomer.", "solution": "1) Identify the dominant intermolecular force. Both n-pentane and neopentane are nonpolar; thus the dominant IMF is the London dispersion force. The pairwise dispersion interaction between two molecules at separation $R$ scales as\n$$V(R) = -\\frac{C_{6}}{R^{6}},$$\nwhere $C_{6}$ depends on the polarizabilities and transition energies of the molecules. For similar molecules (same formula), the intrinsic molecular polarizability magnitudes are comparable, but effective dispersion stabilization in the condensed phase also depends on molecular shape and the extent of close-contact surface area.\n\n2) Connect cohesive interactions to surface tension. Surface tension $\\gamma$ increases with the strength of cohesive interactions within the liquid because creating surface area requires breaking or weakening intermolecular attractions. Qualitatively,\n$$\\gamma \\uparrow \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\text{net cohesive London dispersion} \\uparrow.$$\n\n3) Compare shapes and contact area. n-Pentane has an elongated, flexible, approximately cylindrical shape that allows neighboring molecules to align and maximize contact area, increasing the number and effectiveness of close-range contacts contributing terms of the form $-C_{6}/R^{6}$. Neopentane is more compact and nearly spherical; such branching reduces the accessible surface area for close contact, decreasing the integrated dispersion stabilization in the bulk liquid.\n\n4) Infer the relative surface tensions. Because the effective cumulative dispersion interactions are stronger for the elongated n-pentane than for the compact, spherical neopentane, the cohesive energy is greater for n-pentane, and thus its surface tension is higher.\n\n5) Evaluate the options:\n- A: Incorrect. More spherical shape reduces, not increases, close-contact area and thus reduces dispersion stabilization.\n- B: Incorrect. n-Pentane does not possess a permanent dipole; both molecules are nonpolar. There is no dipole-dipole enhancement.\n- C: Incorrect. Although they share molar mass and electron count, shape-dependent contact area alters the magnitude of dispersion interactions, so surface tensions are not nearly identical.\n- D: Correct. The elongated shape of n-pentane increases intermolecular contact area, strengthening London dispersion forces and increasing surface tension.\n- E: Incorrect. Branching generally lowers effective dispersion interactions in the liquid, despite similar intrinsic polarizability, leading to lower, not higher, surface tension.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1999663"}, {"introduction": "A common misconception is that London dispersion forces are always the weakest type of intermolecular attraction. This exercise [@problem_id:1999682] challenges that idea by comparing tetrabromomethane ($CBr_4$), a large nonpolar molecule, with acetone, a smaller polar molecule. By analyzing their distinct physical properties, you will see how the cumulative effect of LDFs in a molecule with a large, highly polarizable electron cloud can result in cohesive forces that are much stronger than the dipole-dipole interactions in a smaller molecule.", "problem": "A chemistry student is comparing two organic compounds at standard atmospheric pressure.\n\nCompound X is tetrabromomethane ($\\text{CBr}_4$). It is a nonpolar molecule with a symmetrical tetrahedral geometry. It is observed to be a crystalline solid at room temperature, with a melting point of 90.1 °C. The molar mass of $\\text{CBr}_4$ is 331.63 g/mol.\n\nCompound Y is acetone ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COCH}_3$). It is a polar molecule due to the electronegative oxygen atom creating a net dipole moment. It is a volatile liquid at room temperature, with a boiling point of 56 °C. The molar mass of acetone is 58.08 g/mol.\n\nThe observation that nonpolar $\\text{CBr}_4$ has a significantly higher melting and boiling point than polar acetone indicates that the intermolecular forces in $\\text{CBr}_4$ are substantially stronger. Which of the following statements provides the best scientific explanation for this phenomenon?\n\nA. The intramolecular C-Br covalent bonds are inherently stronger than the C=O bond, which translates to stronger intermolecular attractions.\n\nB. The higher molar mass of tetrabromomethane increases the gravitational attraction between its molecules, making these forces dominant over acetone's dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nC. As a solid, tetrabromomethane's molecules are arranged in a rigid crystal lattice, and the forces holding a lattice together are always stronger than the forces within a liquid.\n\nD. The large electron cloud of the tetrabromomethane molecule is highly polarizable, leading to very strong London dispersion forces that surpass the strength of the dipole-dipole interactions in the smaller acetone molecule.\n\nE. Tetrabromomethane is capable of forming halogen bonds, a type of intermolecular force that is stronger than the hydrogen bonds present in acetone.", "solution": "We use the principle that at a fixed external pressure, higher melting and boiling points indicate stronger net intermolecular attractions. The relevant intermolecular forces are determined by molecular size, polarizability, and permanent multipoles.\n\n1) Identify the dominant intermolecular forces:\n- For $\\text{CBr}_4$ (nonpolar), the only cohesive forces are London dispersion forces. The dispersion interaction between two molecules has leading term\n$$U_{\\text{disp}}(r) \\approx -\\frac{C_{6}}{r^{6}},$$\nwith $C_{6}$ scaling with the product of the polarizabilities and characteristic excitation energies of the interacting species. Larger, more polarizable electron clouds increase $C_{6}$ and thus strengthen dispersion.\n- For acetone (polar), the cohesive forces include dipole-dipole plus London dispersion. The orientation-averaged dipole-dipole (Keesom) contribution between freely rotating dipoles at temperature $T$ scales as\n$$U_{\\text{dd,avg}}(r) \\propto -\\frac{\\mu^{4}}{(4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0})^{2} k_{B} T\\, r^{6}},$$\nwhich shows a $T$-dependent weakening due to thermal averaging. Acetone also has dispersion, but its smaller electron cloud yields a smaller polarizability and thus a smaller $C_{6}$ than in $\\text{CBr}_4$.\n\n2) Compare magnitudes qualitatively:\n- $\\text{CBr}_4$ contains heavy, highly polarizable bromine atoms; its molecular electron cloud is large and diffuse, giving a large polarizability $\\alpha$ and a large $C_{6}$. Consequently, $|U_{\\text{disp}}|$ is large and can surpass the combined dipole-dipole (thermally averaged) plus smaller dispersion forces in acetone. This explains the much higher melting and boiling points of $\\text{CBr}_4$.\n\n3) Evaluate each option:\n- A: Incorrect. Intramolecular covalent bond strengths (e.g., C–Br vs C=O) do not directly determine intermolecular cohesion. Phase transitions depend on the sum of intermolecular potentials $U(r)$, not intramolecular bond energies.\n- B: Incorrect. Gravitational attraction scales as $F_{g}=G m^{2}/r^{2}$ and is negligible at molecular scales compared with electromagnetic-based intermolecular forces, and cannot dominate over dipole-dipole or dispersion.\n- C: Incorrect. Being a crystalline solid is the consequence of strong intermolecular forces, not an independent cause; moreover, “always stronger than in a liquid” across different substances is not a valid explanatory principle.\n- D: Correct. The large, highly polarizable electron cloud of $\\text{CBr}_4$ yields very strong London dispersion forces ($U_{\\text{disp}}\\propto -C_{6}/r^{6}$ with large $C_{6}$), which can exceed acetone’s dipole-dipole interactions (thermally averaged and $T$-dependent) plus its weaker dispersion due to smaller polarizability.\n- E: Incorrect. Pure acetone does not form hydrogen bonds with itself because it lacks an X–H (X = O, N, F) donor; its dominant specific interaction is dipole-dipole. $\\text{CBr}_4$, being nonpolar and symmetric, is not dominantly stabilized by halogen bonding in the bulk; its cohesion is dominated by dispersion.\n\nTherefore, the best scientific explanation is that $\\text{CBr}_4$’s highly polarizable electron cloud produces very strong London dispersion forces that surpass acetone’s dipole-dipole interactions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1999682"}]}
