{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The strength of a hydrogen-bonded network is not just about the strength of a single bond, but about the total number of connections each molecule can form. This exercise challenges you to move beyond simply identifying hydrogen bonds to quantifying the extent of a hydrogen-bond network. By comparing water ($H_2O$) and hydrogen fluoride ($HF$), you will see how the balance between hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors dictates the three-dimensional structure of a solid and directly explains macroscopic properties like melting point [@problem_id:1999114].", "problem": "The melting points of water ($H_2O$) and hydrogen fluoride ($HF$) are $0.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $-83.6^\\circ\\text{C}$, respectively. This large difference is primarily due to the differences in the hydrogen-bonding networks formed in their solid states. A hydrogen bond forms between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (the donor) and a lone pair of electrons on an adjacent electronegative atom (the acceptor). For a molecule to participate in a hydrogen bond, it must possess at least one donor site (an H atom bonded to F, O, or N) and at least one acceptor site (a lone pair on an F, O, or N atom).\n\nIn their crystalline solid forms, both $H_2O$ and $HF$ molecules arrange themselves to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds they can form, creating extensive networks. The number of bonds a molecule can form is limited by either its number of donor sites or its number of acceptor sites.\n\nGiven that a water molecule has two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs on the oxygen atom, and a hydrogen fluoride molecule has one hydrogen atom and three lone pairs on the fluorine atom, what are the average numbers of hydrogen bonds formed by a single molecule of $H_2O$ and a single molecule of $HF$ in their respective ideal solid-state lattices?\n\nSelect the correct pair of values.\n\nA. $H_2O$: 2, $HF$: 1\n\nB. $H_2O$: 2, $HF$: 2\n\nC. $H_2O$: 4, $HF$: 1\n\nD. $H_2O$: 4, $HF$: 2\n\nE. $H_2O$: 4, $HF$: 3", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hydrogen bonds that a single molecule of water ($H_2O$) and a single molecule of hydrogen fluoride ($HF$) can form in their respective solid lattices. This number is determined by the count of hydrogen bond donor sites and acceptor sites on each molecule. The actual number of bonds formed is limited by whichever count (donors or acceptors) is smaller.\n\nLet's analyze the water molecule ($H_2O$) first.\nA water molecule consists of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. The oxygen atom is highly electronegative.\n-   **Donor sites:** Each of the two hydrogen atoms is covalently bonded to the oxygen atom. Therefore, a water molecule has **2 hydrogen bond donor sites**.\n-   **Acceptor sites:** An oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. Two are used for covalent bonds with the two hydrogen atoms, leaving 4 electrons as two lone pairs. Each lone pair can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. Therefore, a water molecule has **2 hydrogen bond acceptor sites**.\n\nFor a water molecule, the number of donor sites (2) is equal to the number of acceptor sites (2). This means that, in an ideal arrangement like the crystal structure of ice, each water molecule can participate in a total of four hydrogen bonds: it donates its two hydrogens to two neighboring water molecules and accepts two hydrogens from two other neighboring water molecules using its two lone pairs. This balance allows for the formation of a stable, extensive, three-dimensional tetrahedral network. Thus, the average number of hydrogen bonds per $H_2O$ molecule is 4.\n\nNext, let's analyze the hydrogen fluoride molecule ($HF$).\nA hydrogen fluoride molecule consists of one hydrogen atom and one fluorine atom. The fluorine atom is the most electronegative element.\n-   **Donor sites:** The single hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to the fluorine atom. Therefore, an $HF$ molecule has only **1 hydrogen bond donor site**.\n-   **Acceptor sites:** A fluorine atom has 7 valence electrons. One is used for the covalent bond with the hydrogen atom, leaving 6 electrons as three lone pairs. Each lone pair can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. Therefore, an $HF$ molecule has **3 hydrogen bond acceptor sites**.\n\nFor an $HF$ molecule, the number of hydrogen bonds it can form is limited by the minimum of its donor and acceptor sites. It has only 1 donor site but 3 acceptor sites. This imbalance means that even though it has plenty of lone pairs to accept hydrogen bonds, it only has one hydrogen to donate. In the solid state, each $HF$ molecule can donate its one hydrogen to a neighbor and accept one hydrogen from another neighbor. This results in the formation of a zig-zag chain structure ($...H-F...H-F...$) rather than a 3D network. In this chain, each $HF$ molecule is connected to two other molecules. Therefore, the average number of hydrogen bonds per $HF$ molecule is 2.\n\nIn summary:\n-   Average bonds per $H_2O$ molecule = 4\n-   Average bonds per $HF$ molecule = 2\n\nThe greater number of hydrogen bonds per molecule in ice (4) compared to solid $HF$ (2) results in a much stronger and more stable intermolecular network, requiring more energy to break apart. This explains the significantly higher melting point of ice.\n\nComparing our calculated values with the given options:\nA. $H_2O$: 2, $HF$: 1 - Incorrect.\nB. $H_2O$: 2, $HF$: 2 - Incorrect for $H_2O$.\nC. $H_2O$: 4, $HF$: 1 - Incorrect for $HF$.\nD. $H_2O$: 4, $HF$: 2 - Correct.\nE. $H_2O$: 4, $HF$: 3 - Incorrect. The number of bonds is limited by the single H-donor, not the 3 lone pair acceptors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1999114"}, {"introduction": "One of the most direct and observable consequences of hydrogen bonding is its dramatic effect on boiling points. This practice problem provides a perfect case study using a set of isomers—molecules with the same chemical formula but different structures.

Among amides, the capacity to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds depends on the presence of N–H bonds (hydrogen-bond donors) and the carbonyl oxygen (hydrogen-bond acceptor). Primary amides have two N–H bonds (two donors) and one acceptor; secondary amides have one N–H bond (one donor) and one acceptor; tertiary amides have no N–H bonds (no donors) but still have the carbonyl acceptor. The resonance-stabilized amide group yields strong, directional hydrogen bonding when donors are present.\n\nSince all three are isomers, their molecular sizes and London dispersion contributions are broadly comparable. Therefore, differences in boiling point are dominated by hydrogen-bonding capacity:\n- Propanamide (primary amide): two N–H donors and one acceptor; forms the strongest and most extensive hydrogen-bond network among the three; highest boiling point.\n- N-methylacetamide (secondary amide): one N–H donor and one acceptor; forms a weaker hydrogen-bond network than the primary amide; intermediate boiling point.\n- N,N-dimethylformamide (tertiary amide): no N–H donor; cannot donate hydrogen bonds and thus cannot form the strong amide–amide hydrogen-bond network; lowest boiling point despite a substantial dipole moment.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing boiling point is\n$$\\text{N,N-dimethylformamide} < \\text{N-methylacetamide} < \\text{propanamide},$$\nwhich corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2156791"}, {"introduction": "Hydrogen bonds typically form *between* separate molecules, but what happens when a molecule can form a hydrogen bond *within* itself? This phenomenon, known as intramolecular hydrogen bonding, can significantly alter a substance's physical properties. This problem explores a classic example, comparing two isomers where functional groups are positioned either to favor internal bonding or external bonding, revealing why one is surprisingly more volatile than the other [@problem_id:1999119].", "problem": "A chemist is tasked with separating a mixture of two structural isomers of hydroxybenzaldehyde: 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. In 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the hydroxyl (-OH) group and the aldehyde (-CHO) group are attached to adjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring (the 1,2 or *ortho* positions). In 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, these two groups are attached to carbon atoms on opposite sides of the benzene ring (the 1,4 or *para* positions). The chemist plans to use a separation technique that relies on differences in volatility, where the more volatile component will vaporize at a lower temperature.\n\nBased on the principles of intermolecular forces, which isomer is expected to be more volatile, and what is the primary reason for this difference in volatility?\n\nA. 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is more volatile because its linear structure minimizes steric hindrance, weakening London dispersion forces.\n\nB. 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is more volatile because it can form stable intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which reduces the extent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n\nC. 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is more volatile because the aldehyde group's electron-withdrawing effect is stronger at the para position, reducing the polarity of the O-H bond and weakening hydrogen bonding.\n\nD. 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is more volatile because the proximity of the two functional groups leads to repulsive electronic interactions that raise the molecule's ground state energy, making it easier to vaporize.\n\nE. Both isomers have identical volatility because they have the same molecular formula and thus the same molar mass and number of electrons, leading to identical intermolecular forces.", "solution": "Volatility at a fixed temperature is determined by the equilibrium vapor pressure. From the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, assuming $\\Delta H_{vap}$ is approximately temperature-independent over a small range,\n$$\n\\ln p = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{vap}}{R T} + C,\n$$\nso, at fixed $T$, a smaller $\\Delta H_{vap}$ yields a larger $p$ and hence higher volatility.\n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization is primarily governed by the cohesive intermolecular interactions in the liquid. Writing the cohesive contribution schematically as\n$$\n\\Delta H_{vap} \\approx U_{L} + U_{D} + U_{HB},\n$$\nwhere $U_{L}$ is the London dispersion contribution, $U_{D}$ the dipole–dipole contribution, and $U_{HB}$ the hydrogen-bonding contribution, structural isomers with the same molecular formula typically have similar $U_{L}$ and comparable $U_{D}$, while $U_{HB}$ can differ substantially depending on hydrogen-bonding topology.\n\nFor 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (ortho), the $-OH$ and $-CHO$ groups are adjacent, allowing the formation of a stable intramolecular hydrogen bond that closes a six-membered ring. This intramolecular hydrogen bonding sequesters the hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor within the same molecule, thereby reducing their availability for intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the liquid.
