Both molecules are known to have a trigonal pyramidal geometry with a lone pair of electrons on the central nitrogen atom.\n\nThe first student argues: \"Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and hydrogen is significantly less electronegative than nitrogen. The electronegativity difference between nitrogen and fluorine is much larger than between nitrogen and hydrogen. Therefore, the $\\text{N}-\\text{F}$ bonds are much more polar than the $\\text{N}-\\text{H}$ bonds. A molecule with more polar bonds must have a larger overall molecular dipole moment, so $\\text{NF}_3$ will exhibit stronger dipole-dipole interactions than $\\text{NH}_3$.\"\n\nThe second student counters: \"It's more complex. The final molecular dipole moment is the vector sum of all individual bond dipoles and the contribution from the lone pair. The orientation of these vectors is critical.\"\n\nUsing the provided electronegativity values on the Pauling scale, determine which molecule has the stronger dipole-dipole interactions by correctly analyzing the molecular structure.\n\nPauling Electronegativity Values:\n- Hydrogen (H): 2.20\n- Nitrogen (N): 3.04\n- Fluorine (F): 3.98\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct conclusion and reasoning?\n\nA. The first student is correct. The greater electronegativity difference in the $\\text{N}-\\text{F}$ bonds guarantees that $\\text{NF}_3$ has a larger net molecular dipole moment and thus stronger dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nB. The second student is correct. In $\\text{NH}_3$, the dipoles of the three $\\text{N}-\\text{H}$ bonds and the dipole contribution of the lone pair all point in a similar general direction, leading to a large net molecular dipole. In $\\text{NF}_3$, the dipoles of the highly polar $\\text{N}-\\text{F}$ bonds oppose the dipole contribution of the lone pair, leading to partial cancellation and a small net molecular dipole. Therefore, $\\text{NH}_3$ has stronger dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nC. The first student is correct, but for the wrong reason. Both molecules have nearly identical molecular dipole moments, but the much larger molar mass of $\\text{NF}_3$ causes it to have stronger dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nD. Both students are fundamentally mistaken. Due to the trigonal symmetry, the bond dipoles in both $\\text{NH}_3$ and $\\text{NF}_3$ cancel out completely, resulting in nonpolar molecules with zero dipole moment. Their primary intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces.\n\nE. The second student is correct, but the reasoning is flawed. The lone pair in $\\text{NF}_3$ is more diffuse and polarizable because of the electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms, and this effect is what primarily reduces its contribution to the overall dipole moment, making $\\text{NH}_3$ more polar.", "solution": "We analyze the molecular dipole as a vector sum of all contributing dipoles. For a molecule with a lone pair and three identical bonds in a trigonal pyramidal ($C_{3v}$) geometry, define the molecular dipole as\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{mol}}=\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{lp}}+\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{bond},i}.\n$$\nBy symmetry, place the $C_{3}$ axis along the $z$-axis with the lone pair directed along $+z$. Each bond makes the same angle $\\theta$ with the $z$-axis. The three in-plane components of the bond dipoles cancel, and only the axial components add, giving\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{mol}}=\\left|\\mu_{\\text{lp}}+\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\mu_{\\text{bond}}\\cos\\theta\\,\\sigma_{i}\\right|=\\left|\\mu_{\\text{lp}}+3\\,\\mu_{\\text{bond}}\\cos\\theta\\,\\sigma\\right|,\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma=\\pm 1$ encodes whether the axial component of the bond dipole reinforces ($\\sigma=+1$) or opposes ($\\sigma=-1$) the lone-pair contribution.\n\nThe direction of each bond dipole is determined by electronegativity. Using the provided Pauling values, the ordering is\n$$\n\\chi_{\\text{F}}\\chi_{\\text{N}}\\chi_{\\text{H}}.\n$$\nTherefore:\n- In $\\text{NH}_3$, each $\\text{N}-\\text{H}$ bond dipole points toward nitrogen (toward the more electronegative atom), i.e., toward the lone pair direction. Hence $\\sigma=+1$ and\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{mol}}(\\text{NH}_3)=\\mu_{\\text{lp}}+3\\,\\mu_{\\text{NH}}\\cos\\theta.\n$$\n- In $\\text{NF}_3$, each $\\text{N}-\\text{F}$ bond dipole points toward fluorine, i.e., away from nitrogen and opposite the lone pair direction. Hence $\\sigma=-1$ and\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{mol}}(\\text{NF}_3)=\\left|\\mu_{\\text{lp}}-3\\,\\mu_{\\text{NF}}\\cos\\theta\\right|.\n$$\n\nBond dipole magnitudes increase with bond polarity and bond length, and polarity grows with the electronegativity difference, so\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{NF}}\\mu_{\\text{NH}} \\quad \\text{because} \\quad \\chi_{\\text{F}}-\\chi_{\\text{N}}\\chi_{\\text{N}}-\\chi_{\\text{H}}.\n$$\nConsequently, in $\\text{NH}_3$ the three bond dipoles add constructively to the lone-pair contribution, producing a relatively large net dipole. In $\\text{NF}_3$ the three, more polar $\\text{N}-\\text{F}$ bond dipoles subtract from the lone-pair contribution, causing partial cancellation and a smaller net dipole. Since dipole-dipole interaction strength increases with the magnitude of the molecular dipole, $\\text{NH}_3$ exhibits stronger dipole-dipole interactions than $\\text{NF}_3$.\n\nThis matches the second student’s reasoning: the vector orientation of bond dipoles relative to the lone pair is decisive, not merely the bond polarity magnitude. Therefore, the correct choice is the statement that explicitly invokes this vector-sum cancellation in $\\text{NF}_3$ and reinforcement in $\\text{NH}_3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1998882"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative rankings are useful, a quantitative understanding requires calculating the actual energy of these intermolecular forces.
