This conceptual exercise [@problem_id:2027817] challenges a common misconception about evaporation by examining the relationship between surface area, evaporation rate, and equilibrium vapor pressure. Mastering this distinction between thermodynamics and kinetics is fundamental to accurately describing phase transitions.", "problem": "Two chemistry students, Alice and Bob, are discussing how to most quickly dry a piece of fabric that is soaked with water. The lab environment can be considered a large, open system at a constant temperature and pressure.\n\nAlice suggests, \"We should spread the fabric out completely. A larger surface area will make the water evaporate faster.\"\n\nBob replies, \"I agree. By increasing the surface area of the water on the fabric, we are increasing its equilibrium vapor pressure. A higher vapor pressure means a faster rate of evaporation.\"\n\nEvaluate Bob's reasoning. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate scientific analysis of the situation?\n\nA. Bob's reasoning is entirely correct. Increasing surface area directly causes an increase in the water's equilibrium vapor pressure, which drives faster evaporation.\nB. Bob is incorrect. Increasing the surface area has no effect on the rate of evaporation; only increasing the temperature can make the fabric dry faster.\nC. Bob's conclusion that the fabric dries faster is correct, but his reasoning is flawed. Increasing the surface area increases the rate of evaporation by exposing more water molecules to the air, but it does not change the equilibrium vapor pressure of the water at that temperature.\nD. Bob is partially correct. The rate of evaporation increases, but this is because the increased surface area lowers the boiling point of the water, not because it changes the vapor pressure.\nE. Bob is fundamentally mistaken. Increasing the surface area actually decreases the rate of evaporation because it allows for more efficient heat loss to the surroundings, lowering the water's local temperature.", "solution": "We evaluate whether increasing surface area changes the equilibrium vapor pressure and whether it increases the evaporation rate.\n\nThermodynamics of equilibrium vapor pressure:\n- For a pure liquid in equilibrium with its vapor at a given temperature, the equilibrium vapor pressure is a state function of temperature (and composition), not of surface area. This follows from equality of chemical potentials at equilibrium:\n$$\n\\mu_{l}(T,p_{l})=\\mu_{v}(T,p_{v}),\n$$\nwith the ideal-gas form for the vapor chemical potential,\n$$\n\\mu_{v}(T,p)=\\mu_{v}^{\\circ}(T)+R T \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p}{p^{\\circ}}\\right).\n$$\nSolving this condition yields the saturation pressure $p_{\\text{sat}}(T)$, which depends only on $T$ and the liquid’s properties. Its temperature dependence is given by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation,\n$$\n\\frac{d \\ln p_{\\text{sat}}}{d T}=\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R T^{2}}.\n$$\nThere is no dependence on surface area in $p_{\\text{sat}}(T)$. Thus, Bob’s claim that increasing surface area increases the equilibrium vapor pressure is incorrect.\n\nKinetics of evaporation rate:\n- The net evaporative mass (or molar) flux away from a liquid surface into a gas is driven by the difference between the saturation vapor pressure at the interface and the ambient vapor partial pressure. In a kinetic-theory form, the net molecular flux per unit area can be written as\n$$\nJ_{\\text{net}}=\\alpha \\frac{p_{\\text{sat}}(T)-p_{v}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_{B} T}},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is an accommodation coefficient, $m$ is the molecular mass, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $p_{v}$ is the ambient water vapor partial pressure near the interface. The total evaporation rate is then\n$$\n\\dot{n}=A\\,J_{\\text{net}},\n$$\nwhich shows a linear proportionality to the interfacial area $A$. Alternatively, from a mass-transfer viewpoint,\n$$\n\\dot{n}=k_{c}\\,A\\left(p_{\\text{sat}}(T)-p_{v,\\infty}\\right),\n$$\nwith $k_{c}$ a mass-transfer coefficient and $p_{v,\\infty}$ the bulk-gas vapor partial pressure. In both representations, increasing the surface area increases the total evaporation rate by scaling up the area over which the per-area flux operates; it does not alter $p_{\\text{sat}}(T)$.\n\nBoiling point and curvature considerations:\n- The boiling point $T_{b}$ is defined by $p_{\\text{sat}}(T_{b})=p_{\\text{ext}}$ and is not reduced by merely spreading the liquid over a larger area. While extreme curvature can affect local vapor pressure via the Kelvin effect, this is not a consequence of area per se and is not the operative mechanism in typical fabric drying.\n\nConclusion:\n- The fabric does dry faster when spread out because the total evaporation rate increases with interfacial area, but the equilibrium vapor pressure at a given temperature does not change. Therefore, Bob’s conclusion is correct, but his reasoning is flawed, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2027817"}, {"introduction": "The relationship between temperature and vapor pressure can be described mathematically, allowing for powerful predictions.
