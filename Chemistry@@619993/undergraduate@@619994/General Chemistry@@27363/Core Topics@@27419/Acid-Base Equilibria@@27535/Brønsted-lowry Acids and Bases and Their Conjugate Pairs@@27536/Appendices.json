This practice moves beyond simple identification to prediction, challenging you to consider the stability of the conjugate acid that is formed [@problem_id:1981030]. By analyzing the resonance structures for the possible protonated forms of urea, you will connect the abstract concept of electronic delocalization to the tangible chemical property of basicity, a critical skill for predicting reactivity in organic chemistry and biochemistry.", "problem": "Urea, with the chemical formula $(NH_2)_2CO$, is a common organic compound widely used as a nitrogen-release fertilizer. In an acidic environment, it can act as a Brønsted-Lowry base by accepting a proton $(H^+)$. Protonation can theoretically occur at one of two distinct types of sites within the molecule: the oxygen atom or one of the two equivalent nitrogen atoms. By analyzing the relative stability of the resulting conjugate acids, one can predict the preferred site of protonation.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the most basic site on the urea molecule?\n\nA. The oxygen atom.\n\nB. One of the nitrogen atoms.\n\nC. All three heteroatoms (the oxygen and both nitrogen atoms) are equally basic.\n\nD. The carbon atom.\n\nE. Protonation does not occur as urea is not a base.", "solution": "We identify Brønsted-Lowry basic sites as atoms bearing lone pairs that can accept a proton. In urea, $(NH_2)_2CO$, the candidate sites are the carbonyl oxygen and the two equivalent amide nitrogens. The carbonyl carbon is not a plausible Brønsted base because it is electron-poor and protonation there would violate preferred valence and not correspond to a typical Lewis base site.\n\nFirst, assess the intrinsic availability of lone pairs in neutral urea. Each nitrogen lone pair is delocalized into the carbonyl via $n_{N} \\to \\pi^{*}_{C=O}$ conjugation, as evidenced by canonical forms in which $C=O$ becomes $C-O^{-}$ while one $NH_2$ bears a positive charge and forms a $C=N$ bond. This resonance reduces the basicity of the amide nitrogens relative to amines, because their lone pairs are partially engaged in resonance with the carbonyl.\n\nNext, compare the conjugate acids formed at each site and their relative stabilities.\n\nO-protonation:\n$$(NH_2)_2C=O + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons (NH_2)_2C=OH^{+}$$\nThe oxonium conjugate acid is stabilized by resonance. Canonical contributors include the form with positive charge on oxygen, $(NH_2)_2C=OH^{+}$, and forms in which one nitrogen donates into the carbonyl, converting $C=O$ to $C-OH$ while placing the positive charge on nitrogen with a $C=N$ double bond. Because urea has two nitrogens, the positive charge can be delocalized over oxygen and either nitrogen through multiple contributors. Thus O-protonation retains and even enhances $n_{N} \\to \\pi^{*}_{C=O}$ conjugation and distributes the positive charge over several heteroatoms, providing substantial stabilization.\n\nN-protonation:\n$$(NH_2)_2C=O + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons (NH_3^{+})(NH_2)C=O \\quad \\text{(protonation at one nitrogen)}$$\nHere, the protonated nitrogen no longer has a lone pair to donate, so its resonance interaction with the carbonyl is lost. Although the other nitrogen can still donate into the carbonyl, the overall resonance stabilization is reduced compared to O-protonation, and the positive charge remains localized on the ammonium nitrogen. This disruption of amide-like resonance raises the energy of the N-protonated conjugate acid relative to the O-protonated one.\n\nBy the Brønsted-Lowry principle, the more basic site is the one that forms the more stable conjugate acid. Because O-protonation leads to a conjugate acid with greater resonance delocalization and charge dispersion (and because standard acid-catalyzed amide and urea reactions proceed via initial O-protonation of the carbonyl), the oxygen is the most basic site in urea under acidic conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the oxygen atom.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1981030"}]}
