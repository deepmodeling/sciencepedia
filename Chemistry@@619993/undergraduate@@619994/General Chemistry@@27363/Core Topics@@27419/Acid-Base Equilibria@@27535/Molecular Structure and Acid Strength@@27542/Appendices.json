A more stable conjugate base corresponds to a stronger parent acid. Consider two common organic compounds: ethanol ($CH_3CH_2OH$) and acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$).\n\nBy analyzing the electronic and structural features that influence the stability of their respective conjugate bases (the ethoxide ion, $CH_3CH_2O^{-}$, and the acetate ion, $CH_3COO^{-}$), determine which of the following statements correctly identifies the stronger acid and the primary reason for its enhanced acidity.\n\nA. Acetic acid is the stronger acid because its conjugate base is stabilized by resonance, which delocalizes the negative charge.\nB. Ethanol is the stronger acid because the ethyl group in its conjugate base donates electron density, which stabilizes the negative charge.\nC. Acetic acid is the stronger acid because it contains more oxygen atoms, which increases the overall electronegativity of the molecule.\nD. Ethanol is the stronger acid because its conjugate base, the ethoxide ion, has the negative charge localized on a single oxygen atom, making it more stable than a delocalized charge.\nE. The two acids have nearly identical strengths because in both conjugate bases, the negative charge resides on an oxygen atom.", "solution": "The Brønsted-Lowry acidity of a molecule $\\mathrm{HA}$ is governed by the thermodynamic stability of its conjugate base $\\mathrm{A^{-}}$ formed in the equilibrium\n$$\n\\mathrm{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H^{+}} + \\mathrm{A^{-}},\n$$\nwith the acid dissociation constant\n$$\nK_{a}=\\frac{[\\mathrm{H^{+}}][\\mathrm{A^{-}}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]},\n$$\nand the standard free energy relation\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}=-R T \\ln K_{a}.\n$$\nA more stable conjugate base lowers $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for deprotonation and increases $K_{a}$, yielding a stronger acid.\n\nFor ethanol, deprotonation gives the ethoxide ion $\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}}$. In this anion, the negative charge is localized on a single oxygen atom, and the adjacent ethyl group exerts a weak electron-donating inductive effect, which increases electron density on the oxygen and destabilizes the anion. There is no resonance delocalization available to spread the negative charge beyond that oxygen.\n\nFor acetic acid, deprotonation gives the acetate ion $\\mathrm{CH_{3}COO^{-}}$. This anion is stabilized by resonance: the negative charge is delocalized over the two oxygen atoms through the $\\pi$ system of the carboxylate, with two equivalent major resonance contributors differing only in which oxygen bears the formal negative charge. This delocalization lowers charge density and stabilizes the anion significantly relative to a localized alkoxide.\n\nEvaluating the statements:\n- A correctly identifies acetic acid as the stronger acid and cites the correct primary reason: resonance stabilization that delocalizes the negative charge in the acetate conjugate base.\n- B is incorrect because electron donation from an alkyl group destabilizes, rather than stabilizes, a negatively charged oxygen.\n- C is incorrect because simply having more oxygen atoms is not the primary reason; the key factor is resonance delocalization in the conjugate base, not a bulk increase in molecular electronegativity.\n- D is incorrect because localization of negative charge makes an anion less stable than a resonance-delocalized charge.\n- E is incorrect because, despite both conjugate bases placing negative charge on oxygen, their stabilities differ markedly due to the presence (acetate) or absence (ethoxide) of resonance delocalization.\n\nTherefore, acetic acid is the stronger acid due to resonance stabilization of its conjugate base.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2000203"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand the role of resonance within the carboxylate group, we can explore how to fine-tune a molecule's acidity.

Electron-donating alkyl groups destabilize the carboxylate via a $+I$ effect, decreasing $K_a$ and raising $p\\text{K}_a$.\n\nEvaluate each substituent:\n- In fluoroacetic acid ($R=CH_{2}F$), the fluorine atom is strongly electronegative and exerts a pronounced $-I$ effect through the $\\sigma$ framework, stabilizing $RCOO^{-}$. This increases $K_a$ and decreases $p\\text{K}_a$ the most among the given options.\n- In formic acid ($R=H$), there is essentially no electron-donating inductive effect, so $RCOO^{-}$ is not destabilized by alkyl donation. It is more acidic than alkyl-substituted analogs but less acidic than the fluoro-substituted compound due to the absence of a strong $-I$ substituent.\n- In acetic acid ($R=CH_{3}$), the methyl group donates electron density by a $+I$ effect, destabilizing the carboxylate and lowering $K_a$ relative to formic acid, thus increasing $p\\text{K}_a$.\n- In propanoic acid ($R=CH_{3}CH_{2}$), the larger alkyl group has a stronger $+I$ effect than methyl, further destabilizing the conjugate base and yielding the highest $p\\text{K}_a$.\n\nTherefore, the acidity order is\n$$\n\\text{fluoroacetic acid} > \\text{formic acid} > \\text{acetic acid} > \\text{propanoic acid},\n$$\nso the compound with the lowest $p\\text{K}_a$ is fluoroacetic acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2007034"}, {"introduction": "Molecular structure involves more than just connectivity; it also includes three-dimensional geometry, which can have profound chemical consequences.

Maleic acid is the *cis*-isomer, where the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the C=C double bond. Upon losing the first proton, the resulting monoanion ($\\text{HM}^-$) can form a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond between the remaining acidic proton of one carboxyl group and the oxygen of the newly formed carboxylate group. This hydrogen bond stabilizes the monoanion, making it more favorable to form. A more stable conjugate base corresponds to a stronger acid, hence the lower $p\\text{K}_{a1}$ for maleic acid.\n\nFumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer, where the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.
