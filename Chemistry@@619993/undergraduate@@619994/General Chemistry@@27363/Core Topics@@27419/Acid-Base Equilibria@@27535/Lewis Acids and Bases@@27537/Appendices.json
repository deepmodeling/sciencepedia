{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The definition of a Lewis acid as an electron-pair acceptor often brings to mind species with incomplete octets, like $BF_3$. This practice challenges us to look deeper, exploring why some elements can act as Lewis acids even when they appear to have a full valence shell. By comparing the reactivity of silicon tetrafluoride ($SiF_4$) and carbon tetrachloride ($CCl_4$), we can uncover the crucial role that accessible, low-energy orbitals in elements of the third period and beyond play in accommodating additional electron pairs, a fundamental concept that expands our understanding of Lewis acidity. [@problem_id:2002549]", "problem": "A chemist is investigating the reactivity of two tetrahalide compounds, silicon tetrafluoride ($SiF_4$) and carbon tetrachloride ($CCl_4$). She observes the following: When a solution containing fluoride ions ($F^-$) is introduced to a system with $SiF_4$, a reaction readily occurs to form the stable hexafluorosilicate anion, $[SiF_6]^{2-}$. However, when a similar experiment is performed by introducing a Lewis base to a system containing $CCl_4$, no analogous reaction to form a species like $[CCl_6]^{2-}$ is observed. Both $SiF_4$ and $CCl_4$ are tetrahedral molecules where the central atom has a complete octet.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental and accurate reason for this observed difference in reactivity, where $SiF_4$ acts as a Lewis acid but $CCl_4$ does not?\n\nA. The electronegativity of fluorine is significantly greater than that of chlorine. This makes the partial positive charge on the silicon atom in $SiF_4$ much larger than that on the carbon atom in $CCl_4$, thereby making silicon a far more potent electron pair acceptor.\nB. Carbon is a second-period element and is strictly limited to an octet of electrons in its valence shell due to the absence of low-energy d-orbitals. Silicon, as a third-period element, has accessible, vacant 3d orbitals that can accommodate additional electron pairs, allowing it to expand its valence shell beyond an octet.\nC. The C-Cl bond in carbon tetrachloride is exceptionally strong compared to the Si-F bond in silicon tetrafluoride, which renders the $CCl_4$ molecule kinetically inert and resistant to attack by a Lewis base.\nD. Both $SiF_4$ and $CCl_4$ are nonpolar molecules due to their symmetric tetrahedral geometry. However, the momentary dipoles (London dispersion forces) in $SiF_4$ are stronger than in $CCl_4$, facilitating the initial interaction with the incoming Lewis base.\nE. The chlorine atoms in $CCl_4$ are significantly larger than the fluorine atoms in $SiF_4$. The resulting steric hindrance around the small central carbon atom prevents any approaching Lewis base from getting close enough to donate an electron pair.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the key Lewis acid-base behavior observed:\n- In the presence of $F^{-}$, $SiF_4$ forms the hexacoordinate anion $[SiF_6]^{2-}$ via the net process\n$$\nSiF_4 + 2F^{-} \\to [SiF_6]^{2-},\n$$\nwhich requires the central silicon to increase its coordination number from $4$ to $6$.\n- In contrast, no analogous process is observed for $CCl_4$ with a Lewis base to give $[CCl_6]^{2-}$:\n$$\nCCl_4 + 2\\text{(Lewis base)} \\nrightarrow [CCl_6]^{2-}.\n$$\n\nA Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor. The observed difference is that $SiF_4$ readily accepts additional electron density to become hexacoordinate, while $CCl_4$ does not.\n\nWe now assess the proposed explanations:\n\n1) Option A posits that the larger electronegativity of fluorine relative to chlorine enhances the partial positive charge on silicon in $SiF_4$ compared with carbon in $CCl_4$, thereby making silicon the stronger Lewis acid. While increased bond polarity can enhance Lewis acidity, this is not a fundamental explanation of the contrasting behavior because it fails a counterexample test: even for $CF_4$, where carbon is bonded to highly electronegative fluorine, no species $[CF_6]^{2-}$ forms. Thus, electronegativity alone cannot account for the octet expansion difference and is not the most fundamental reason.\n\n2) Option B states that carbon, a second-period element, is restricted to an octet due to the absence of low-energy acceptor orbitals (traditionally described as the absence of accessible d orbitals), whereas silicon, a third-period element, can accommodate higher coordination (formally beyond an octet). Empirically, silicon commonly forms hexacoordinate species such as $[SiF_6]^{2-}$, while carbon does not form stable hexacoordinate analogues. Although modern bonding descriptions of hypervalency emphasize three-center four-electron bonding and do not require significant d-orbital participation, the fundamental periodic trend captured by this option—that second-period elements are effectively limited to octet configurations, while third-period elements can achieve higher coordination—is the reason that aligns with the observations. Among the provided choices, this is the most accurate fundamental rationale.\n\n3) Option C claims that $C$–$Cl$ bonds are exceptionally strong compared to $Si$–$F$ bonds, making $CCl_4$ kinetically inert. This is incorrect; the $Si$–$F$ bond is very strong, with bond dissociation energy satisfying $D_{\\text{Si-F}} > D_{\\text{C-Cl}}$. The formation of $[SiF_6]^{2-}$ does not rely on weak $Si$–$F$ bonds; rather, it proceeds via coordination to silicon. Hence this option is factually incorrect.\n\n4) Option D invokes London dispersion forces differences to rationalize initial interactions. Dispersion forces between neutral molecules are irrelevant to the fundamental Lewis acid-base process that forms a new coordination complex; they do not explain the capacity to increase coordination number or accept electron pairs into suitable acceptor orbitals. Thus this is not a fundamental explanation.\n\n5) Option E attributes the difference to steric hindrance around carbon due to large chlorine atoms. This fails the same counterexample as for option A: even $CF_4$, with smaller fluorine ligands, does not form $[CF_6]^{2-}$. Therefore sterics around carbon are not the fundamental barrier; rather, carbon’s valence shell cannot accommodate stable hexacoordination.\n\nConclusion: The only option that captures the fundamental periodic reason for the observed difference—second-period octet limitation versus third-period capacity for higher coordination—is option B. While the historical mention of vacant d orbitals is not the modern orbital-level description, among the provided choices B is the most fundamental and accurate for explaining why $SiF_4$ acts as a Lewis acid to form $[SiF_6]^{2-}$, whereas $CCl_4$ does not form $[CCl_6]^{2-}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2002549"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify Lewis acids and bases, the next step is to predict the stability of the adducts they form. The \"Hard and Soft Acids and Bases\" (HSAB) principle provides a powerful qualitative framework for this, stating that hard acids prefer to bind to hard bases, and soft acids to soft bases. This exercise provides a compelling real-world application of HSAB theory, asking you to rationalize the dramatic and systematic trend in the aqueous solubility of mercury(II) halides, thereby connecting an abstract chemical principle to an observable physical property. [@problem_id:2264601]", "problem": "The aqueous solubilities of the mercury(II) halides at approximately 25 °C show a dramatic and systematic trend. The experimentally observed solubilities, expressed in grams of solute per 100 mL of water, are approximately:\n- Mercury(II) fluoride ($HgF_2$): Soluble and undergoes hydrolysis.\n- Mercury(II) chloride ($HgCl_2$): 6.9 g/100 mL\n- Mercury(II) bromide ($HgBr_2$): 0.6 g/100 mL\n- Mercury(II) iodide ($HgI_2$): 0.006 g/100 mL\n\nThe trend is a stark decrease in solubility from the fluoride to the iodide salt. Which of the following statements provides the best chemical rationale for this observation?\n\nA. The mercury(II) cation, $Hg^{2+}$, is a soft Lewis acid. The softness of the halide anions increases from $F^{-}$ to $I^{-}$. The increasingly favorable soft-soft interaction from $HgF_2$ to $HgI_2$ leads to greater covalent character and compound stability, thus decreasing solubility.\nB. According to a purely ionic model, lattice energy is inversely proportional to the sum of ionic radii. Since the iodide ion is the largest halide, $HgI_2$ has the lowest lattice energy, which should make it the most soluble. The observed trend contradicts this, so an ionic model is entirely irrelevant.\nC. The electronegativity difference between the cation and anion determines solubility. The large difference for $Hg-F$ makes $HgF_2$ highly ionic and soluble. As the halide becomes less electronegative, the bond becomes more covalent and less soluble. This difference in bond polarity is the sole factor governing the trend.\nD. The mercury(II) cation, $Hg^{2+}$, is a hard Lewis acid. It forms its most stable bond with the hard Lewis base, $F^{-}$. This makes $HgF_2$ the most stable compound and therefore the least soluble, which is opposite to the observed trend.", "solution": "We are asked to rationalize a strong decrease in aqueous solubility from $HgF_2$ to $HgI_2$ for the mercury(II) halides.

Two central chemical principles govern the halide trend.\n\nFirst, the hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) principle: $Hg^{2+}$ is a soft Lewis acid; the halide softness increases $F^{-}Cl^{-}Br^{-}I^{-}$. Soft-soft interactions (e.g., $Hg^{2+}$ with $I^{-}$) are stronger and more covalent than hard-soft mismatches (e.g., $Hg^{2+}$ with $F^{-}$). Increased covalent character stabilizes the solid and decreases its tendency to separate into hydrated ions, thus decreasing solubility from $HgF_2$ to $HgI_2$.\n\nSecond, hydration energetics in water (a hard, polar solvent): the magnitude of anion hydration enthalpy decreases down the halide group,\n$$\n|\\Delta H_{\\text{hydration}}(F^{-})||\\Delta H_{\\text{hydration}}(Cl^{-})||\\Delta H_{\\text{hydration}}(Br^{-})||\\Delta H_{\\text{hydration}}(I^{-})|.\n$$\nHard bases like $F^{-}$ are strongly stabilized by hydration, making dissolution more favorable, while soft, polarizable anions like $I^{-}$ are weakly hydrated, reducing dissolution driving force. Together with the increased covalency and lattice stability for soft-soft pairs, this yields the observed decreasing solubility from fluoride to iodide. The hydrolysis of $HgF_2$ is also consistent with a hard-soft mismatch and the strong basicity/hydration of $F^{-}$ in water.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A states that $Hg^{2+}$ is a soft Lewis acid; halide softness increases down the group; soft-soft interactions from $HgF_2$ to $HgI_2$ increase covalency and stability of the solid, decreasing solubility. This matches HSAB and hydration arguments and correctly rationalizes the trend.\n- B invokes only lattice energy and concludes the ionic model is entirely irrelevant because of a supposed contradiction. This is incorrect: solubility depends on both lattice and hydration energies and on covalency; the ionic model is not irrelevant but incomplete by itself.\n- C attributes the trend solely to electronegativity difference. While decreasing electronegativity difference correlates with increasing covalency, it is not the sole factor; HSAB matching and hydration in water are essential. Thus C is oversimplified and incomplete.\n- D claims $Hg^{2+}$ is a hard acid and would therefore form the least soluble fluoride.
