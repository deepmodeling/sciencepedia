Let $p$ be the number of atoms in the primitive unit cell and let $d$ be the dimensionality of the crystal space.\n\nIn this problem, the primitive unit cell contains three distinct atoms, so we have $p = 3$. The material is described as a three-dimensional crystal, so the dimensionality is $d = 3$.\n\nThe total number of degrees of freedom in the primitive unit cell is the product of the number of atoms and the number of spatial dimensions each atom can move in. Each of these degrees of freedom corresponds to a unique vibrational mode, which in turn gives rise to a distinct phonon branch in the dispersion relation $\\omega(\\mathbf{k})$.\n\nTotal number of phonon branches = $d \\times p$.\nSubstituting the values from the problem:\nTotal number of phonon branches = $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThese branches are categorized into two types: acoustic and optical.\n\nFor any $d$-dimensional crystal, there are always $d$ acoustic branches. These modes correspond to the long-wavelength vibrations where all atoms in the unit cell move in phase, like a sound wave propagating through the medium. Since our crystal is three-dimensional ($d=3$), the number of acoustic branches is 3.\n\nNumber of acoustic branches = $d = 3$.\n\nThe remaining branches are the optical branches. In these modes, atoms within the primitive unit cell vibrate out of phase with respect to each other. The number of optical branches is the total number of branches minus the number of acoustic branches.\n\nNumber of optical branches = (Total branches) - (Acoustic branches)\nNumber of optical branches = $(d \\times p) - d$\nNumber of optical branches = $9 - 3 = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the crystal has 3 acoustic phonon branches and 6 optical phonon branches. The problem requires the answer to be in a row matrix with the number of acoustic branches first, followed by the number of optical branches.
