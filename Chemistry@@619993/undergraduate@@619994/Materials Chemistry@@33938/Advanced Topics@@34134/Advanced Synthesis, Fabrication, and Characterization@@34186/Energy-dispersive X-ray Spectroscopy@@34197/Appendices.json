This forms the essential foundation for all EDS analysis [@problem_id:1297292].", "problem": "An analyst is using Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) to characterize a high-purity, stoichiometric semiconductor wafer of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs). The EDS system utilizes a focused beam of high-energy electrons to induce X-ray emissions from the sample. The electron beam has sufficient energy to excite electrons from both the K-shells and L-shells of gallium and arsenic atoms.\n\nFor this analysis, you are to predict the primary features of the observed EDS spectrum. The most intense characteristic X-ray lines for these elements are the $K_{\\alpha}$ (resulting from an L-shell electron filling a K-shell vacancy) and $L_{\\alpha}$ (resulting from an M-shell electron filling an L-shell vacancy). The energies for these specific transitions are provided below:\n\n- Gallium (Ga, Z=31): $L_{\\alpha}$ line at 1.10 keV; $K_{\\alpha}$ line at 9.25 keV.\n- Arsenic (As, Z=33): $L_{\\alpha}$ line at 1.28 keV; $K_{\\alpha}$ line at 10.54 keV.\n\nAssume the following general rules for interpreting the spectrum:\n1.  For the elements and typical operating conditions involved, the probability of generating L-shell X-rays is significantly higher than that for K-shell X-rays. This results in the $L_{\\alpha}$ peaks being substantially more intense (taller) than the $K_{\\alpha}$ peaks.\n2.  The sample is perfectly stoichiometric, meaning it contains an equal number of Ga and As atoms.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expected EDS spectrum, considering only these four primary emission lines?\n\nA. The spectrum will show two distinct groups of peaks. A low-energy group consists of a peak for Ga $L_{\\alpha}$ at 1.10 keV followed by a slightly higher energy peak for As $L_{\\alpha}$ at 1.28 keV. A high-energy group consists of a peak for Ga $K_{\\alpha}$ at 9.25 keV followed by a higher energy peak for As $K_{\\alpha}$ at 10.54 keV. The $L_{\\alpha}$ peaks are expected to be significantly more intense than the $K_{\\alpha}$ peaks.\n\nB. The spectrum will show two distinct groups of peaks. A low-energy group will contain the $L_{\\alpha}$ peaks for Ga and As, with the As peak appearing at a lower energy than the Ga peak. A high-energy group will contain the $K_{\\alpha}$ peaks, also with the As peak appearing at a lower energy than the Ga peak.\n\nC. The spectrum will show four peaks at the correct energies (1.10, 1.28, 9.25, and 10.54 keV). However, the $K_{\\alpha}$ peaks at 9.25 keV and 10.54 keV will be the most intense peaks in the spectrum, with the $L_{\\alpha}$ peaks appearing much smaller.\n\nD. The spectrum will only consist of two peaks in the high-energy region, one for Ga $K_{\\alpha}$ and one for As $K_{\\alpha}$. The L-shell emissions are too weak to be detected in a standard measurement.\n\nE. The spectrum will show four peaks, but the energy groups will be mixed. The peak order from lowest to highest energy will be Ga $L_{\\alpha}$, As $K_{\\alpha}$, Ga $K_{\\alpha}$, and As $L_{\\alpha}$.", "solution": "We are asked to predict the primary features of an EDS spectrum for a stoichiometric GaAs sample, considering the Ga and As $L_{\\alpha}$ and $K_{\\alpha}$ lines and the stated rules.\n\nFirst, identify which lines appear and their relative energies. Characteristic X-ray energies follow Moseley’s law, which can be expressed schematically as\n$$\nE \\propto (Z-\\sigma)^{2},\n$$\nwith different screening constants for different series. For a given element, K-series lines originate from transitions to the K-shell, while L-series lines originate from transitions to the L-shell. Because K-shell binding energies are larger than L-shell binding energies, for the same element we have\n$$\nE_{K\\alpha}^{X} > E_{L\\alpha}^{X},\n$$\nfor any element $X$. Therefore, for both Ga and As, the $K_{\\alpha}$ lines lie at higher energy than the $L_{\\alpha}$ lines, producing two energy groups: a low-energy group ($L_{\\alpha}$) and a high-energy group ($K_{\\alpha}$).\n\nSecond, order the elements within each series. Since arsenic has a larger atomic number than gallium, $Z_{\\text{As}} > Z_{\\text{Ga}}$, Moseley’s law implies\n$$\nE_{L\\alpha}^{\\text{As}} > E_{L\\alpha}^{\\text{Ga}}, \\quad E_{K\\alpha}^{\\text{As}} > E_{K\\alpha}^{\\text{Ga}}.\n$$\nThus, within the $L_{\\alpha}$ group, the Ga $L_{\\alpha}$ line appears at lower energy than the As $L_{\\alpha}$ line; within the $K_{\\alpha}$ group, the Ga $K_{\\alpha}$ line appears at lower energy than the As $K_{\\alpha}$ line. This matches the ordering implied by the given energies.\n\nThird, compare intensities. By the stated rule 1, under the given conditions the probability of generating L-shell X-rays is significantly higher than that for K-shell X-rays, so the $L_{\\alpha}$ peaks are substantially more intense than the $K_{\\alpha}$ peaks:\n$$\nI_{L\\alpha}^{X} \\gg I_{K\\alpha}^{X},\n$$\nfor $X \\in \\{\\text{Ga}, \\text{As}\\}$. By rule 2 (stoichiometric sample), the numbers of Ga and As atoms are equal, so within the same series the Ga and As peak intensities are comparable aside from differences in excitation cross section and fluorescence yield; the qualitative conclusion remains that the two $L_{\\alpha}$ peaks are taller than the two $K_{\\alpha}$ peaks.\n\nPutting these together, the spectrum will show two distinct groups of peaks: at low energy, Ga $L_{\\alpha}$ followed by As $L_{\\alpha}$; at high energy, Ga $K_{\\alpha}$ followed by As $K_{\\alpha}$. The $L_{\\alpha}$ peaks will be significantly more intense than the $K_{\\alpha}$ peaks. Among the provided statements, this exactly matches option A. Option B reverses the order within the L group (incorrect). Option C incorrectly states the $K_{\\alpha}$ peaks are most intense. Option D incorrectly states L emissions are too weak to detect. Option E mixes the groups incorrectly, violating $E_{K\\alpha}^{X} > E_{L\\alpha}^{X}$ for each element.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1297292"}, {"introduction": "A primary goal of EDS is to determine a material's stoichiometry.
