A key characteristic of ALD is its self-limiting growth mechanism, which occurs when the surface becomes saturated with the precursor. To find the optimal process window, the student conducts a series of depositions. For each run, a total of $N=300$ ALD cycles are performed. The duration of the TDMAH precursor pulse, $t_{p}$, is varied for each run, while all other parameters (temperature, water pulse time, purge durations) are kept constant.
