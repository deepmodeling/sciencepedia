After collecting the scattering intensity data, the student calculates the total scattering structure function, $S(Q)$, where $Q$ is the magnitude of the scattering vector. To understand the local atomic arrangement in real space, the student performs a sine Fourier transform on the data to obtain the Pair Distribution Function (PDF), denoted as $g(r)$. The function $g(r)$ represents the scaled probability of finding an atom at a distance $r$ from an arbitrary reference atom.\n\nUpon plotting the resulting $g(r)$, the student notices that while the first major peak, corresponding to the nearest-neighbor Si-Si, Si-Ge, and Ge-Ge distances, appears around $2.4$ Å, there are also small, oscillating, non-zero values for $g(r)$ in the region $0  r  1.5$ Å.
