The surface is characterized by large, atomically flat terraces which are separated by steps, forming well-defined rectangular mesas. All mesas have a true physical width of $W_{true} = 50.0$ nm and a height of $H = 2.00$ nm.\n\nThe AFM is operated with a silicon nitride tip which, at the beginning of the experiment ($N=0$ scans), has an apex that can be modeled as a perfect hemisphere with a radius of curvature $R_0 = 10.0$ nm. Due to the mechanical interaction with the hard surface, the tip apex experiences wear. This wear process can be modeled as a progressive blunting, where the tip's radius of curvature, $R_{tip}$, increases linearly with the number of scans, $N$, according to the equation $R_{tip}(N) = R_0 + k N$. The wear constant, $k$, has been determined to be $0.100$ nm/scan.\n\nA key artifact in AFM imaging is tip broadening, where the finite size of the tip causes imaged features to appear wider than their true dimensions.

A key parameter they need to determine is its glass transition temperature, $T_g$. They employ a technique known as nano-Thermal Analysis (nTA), which uses a Tapping Mode Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) system equipped with a heated stage.\n\nIn this experiment, the AFM tip is brought into intermittent contact with the polymer surface while the cantilever oscillates near its resonance frequency. The instrument records the phase lag, $\\phi$, between the cantilever's oscillation and the driving signal. This phase lag is directly related to the amount of energy dissipated during the tip-sample interaction. As the sample is heated through its glass transition, the polymer changes from a rigid, glassy state to a softer, more viscoelastic rubbery state. This change significantly increases the energy dissipation at the tip-sample contact, resulting in a distinct increase in the measured phase lag.\n\nThe glass transition temperature, $T_g$, is defined for this analysis as the temperature at which the rate of change of the phase lag with respect to temperature, $\\frac{d\\phi}{dT}$, reaches its maximum value.
