The engineer decides to add a non-reactive, UV-absorbing dye to the base resin.\n\nThe curing process is governed by the following principles:\n1.  A layer of resin solidifies (cures) if the absorbed UV energy per unit area exceeds a material-specific critical exposure, $E_c$.\n2.  The UV light exposure, $E(z)$, at a depth $z$ into the resin follows the law: $E(z) = E_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z)$, where $E_0$ is the exposure at the surface and $\\alpha$ is the total absorption coefficient of the medium.\n3.
