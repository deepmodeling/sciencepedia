To achieve the intended pattern on the wafer, the photomask itself must be intentionally altered using Optical Proximity Correction (OPC). This problem [@problem_id:1316258] challenges you to design an optimal \"hammerhead\" feature to correct for line-end shortening, introducing the real-world engineering trade-off between correction effectiveness and unwanted side effects like increased roughness.", "problem": "In the manufacturing of integrated circuits, photolithography is used to pattern features on a silicon wafer. A major challenge in this process is the distortion of features due to the wave nature of light, a class of issues known as Optical Proximity Effects (OPE). One common OPE is line-end shortening, where the printed end of a rectangular line on the wafer is 'pulled back' from its intended position on the design layout. For a long, isolated line, this pullback distance at each end is denoted by $\\Delta L$.\n\nTo counteract this effect, a technique called Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is employed. This involves modifying the photomask geometry. A common OPC strategy for line-end shortening is to add a rectangular feature, known as a 'hammerhead', to each end of the line on the mask. Let the added hammerhead have a length $L_H$ (parallel to the line) and a width $W_H$ (perpendicular to the line).\n\nA simplified model describes the effectiveness and side-effects of such a hammerhead as follows:\n1. The corrective 'length extension', $C$, provided by the hammerhead is found to be directly proportional to its area, $A_H = L_H W_H$. This relationship is given by $C = \\eta A_H$, where $\\eta$ is an empirically determined process constant with units of inverse length. For the correction to be successful, this extension must exactly cancel the pullback, meaning $C = \\Delta L$.\n2. A significant side-effect of adding features to the mask is an increase in line-edge roughness on the final etched feature. This roughness is detrimental to device performance and is modeled as being proportional to the perimeter, $P_H = 2(L_H + W_H)$, of the added hammerhead.\n\nTo optimize the design for high performance and yield, engineers must design a hammerhead that provides the necessary correction while simultaneously minimizing the induced edge roughness.\n\nAssuming a line-end pullback of $\\Delta L$ must be corrected, determine the minimum possible perimeter, $P_{min}$, of a hammerhead that can achieve this correction based on the given model. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $\\Delta L$ and $\\eta$.", "solution": "We denote the hammerhead dimensions as positive real variables $L_{H}>0$ and $W_{H}>0$.
