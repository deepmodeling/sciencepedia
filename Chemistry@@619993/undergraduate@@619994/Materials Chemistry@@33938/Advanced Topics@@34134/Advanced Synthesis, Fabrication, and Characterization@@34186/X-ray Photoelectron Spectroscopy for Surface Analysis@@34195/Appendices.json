This involves interpreting subtle features in the spectrum that go beyond the main photoemission peaks. This conceptual problem explores the origin of \"shake-up satellites\" and why their presence or absence, rooted in the material's electronic configuration, provides a powerful diagnostic tool for chemical analysis [@problem_id:1347622].", "problem": "A materials chemist is investigating two different copper oxide powders, one black (Sample A) and one red (Sample B), using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). XPS is a surface-sensitive technique that determines the elemental composition and chemical state of a material by irradiating it with X-rays and measuring the kinetic energy of the electrons that are ejected from core atomic orbitals. The energy of the incident X-ray, $h\\nu$, is known, and a work function, $\\phi$, specific to the spectrometer is accounted for. The binding energy, $E_B$, of a core electron is thus determined from its measured kinetic energy, $E_K$, via the relation $E_B = h\\nu - E_K - \\phi$.\n\nIn some transition metal compounds, the main photoemission peak from a core level is accompanied by additional, smaller peaks at higher binding energies. These are known as \"shake-up\" satellites. A shake-up satellite arises when the ejection of the core electron is accompanied by a simultaneous excitation of a valence electron to a higher, unoccupied energy level within the same atom. This secondary excitation consumes a discrete amount of energy, which is drawn from the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectron, causing it to appear at a higher binding energy in the spectrum.\n\nThe chemist obtains the Cu 2p core-level spectra for both samples. The spectrum from Sample A, which is identified as copper(II) oxide (CuO), shows prominent shake-up satellites. In contrast, the spectrum from Sample B, identified as copper(I) oxide (Cu₂O), shows a complete absence of these satellite features.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct fundamental electronic reason for this observed difference in the Cu 2p XPS spectra?\n\nA. The Cu(II) ion in CuO has an incompletely filled 3d shell (a $3d^9$ configuration), which provides an available empty state for a valence electron to be excited into during photoemission. The Cu(I) ion in Cu₂O has a completely filled 3d shell (a $3d^{10}$ configuration), which lacks a low-energy empty state, thus preventing the shake-up process.\n\nB. Shake-up satellites are a result of inter-atomic electron transfer, and the distance between copper ions in the monoclinic crystal structure of CuO is optimal for this process, whereas the larger separation in the cubic structure of Cu₂O forbids it.\n\nC. The formal charge of the copper ion determines the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. For Cu(II), the kinetic energy is low enough for shake-up events to be probable, while for Cu(I), the kinetic energy is too high.\n\nD. Shake-up satellites are caused by the collective oscillation of the valence electron gas, known as a plasmon. CuO behaves like a metal with a high free-electron density that supports plasmons, while Cu₂O is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that does not.\n\nE. In CuO, the oxygen 2p orbitals have a significantly higher energy than the copper 3d orbitals, allowing for an easy O 2p → Cu 3d charge-transfer excitation. In Cu₂O, the orbital energies are reversed, making this process energetically unfavorable.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fundamental electronic reason behind the presence of shake-up satellites in the XPS spectrum of copper(II) oxide (CuO) and their absence in the spectrum of copper(I) oxide (Cu₂O).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the electronic configurations of the copper ions in both oxides.\nA neutral copper atom has an electronic configuration of [Ar] $3d^{10} 4s^1$.\nIn copper(II) oxide (CuO), copper is in the +2 oxidation state. To form the Cu(II) or Cu²⁺ ion, the neutral atom loses two electrons, one from the 4s orbital and one from the 3d orbital. This results in an electronic configuration of [Ar] $3d^9$. The key feature here is that the 3d subshell is incomplete; it has one vacancy, often referred to as a hole.\nIn copper(I) oxide (Cu₂O), copper is in the +1 oxidation state. To form the Cu(I) or Cu⁺ ion, the neutral atom loses its single 4s electron. This results in an electronic configuration of [Ar] $3d^{10}$. In this case, the 3d subshell is completely filled.\n\nNext, we consider the XPS process and the origin of shake-up satellites. The process begins with an incident X-ray photon ejecting a core electron, in this case, a Cu 2p electron.\n1.  **Main Photoemission Peak:** The primary event is the ejection of the Cu 2p electron, leaving the copper ion in a final state with a core hole. For Cu(II), the initial state is $3d^9$, and the final state is $\\underline{2p}3d^9$, where $\\underline{2p}$ denotes the core hole. For Cu(I), the initial state is $3d^{10}$, and the final state is $\\underline{2p}3d^{10}$. This process gives rise to the main Cu 2p peaks in the XPS spectrum.\n\n2.  **Shake-up Satellite Process:** A shake-up satellite occurs when, simultaneous to the core electron ejection, a second electronic transition takes place: the excitation of a valence electron to a higher-energy, unoccupied orbital. This is a two-electron process. The energy for this secondary excitation is taken from the kinetic energy of the primary photoelectron. Because the photoelectron leaves with less kinetic energy ($E_K$), it appears in the spectrum at a higher binding energy ($E_B$).\n\nNow we can apply this understanding to the two copper oxides.\n\n*   **For CuO (Cu(II), $3d^9$):** The Cu(II) ion has a hole in its 3d shell. When the Cu 2p core electron is ejected, it is possible for a valence electron to be simultaneously excited (\"shaken up\") into this 3d hole. This valence electron can originate from a ligand (oxygen) orbital or another d-orbital, often described as a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition. The final state for this shake-up process can be represented as $\\underline{2p}3d^{10}\\underline{L}$, where $\\underline{L}$ represents a hole created in the ligand valence band. Because this low-energy excitation pathway is available, shake-up satellites are a prominent feature in the XPS spectra of Cu(II) compounds.\n\n*   **For Cu₂O (Cu(I), $3d^{10}$):** The Cu(I) ion has a completely filled 3d subshell. When the Cu 2p core electron is ejected, there is no low-energy vacancy within the 3d shell for a valence electron to be excited into. Any potential excitation would have to be to a much higher energy orbital (like the 4s or 4p), which is a far less probable event and would occur at a much higher energy loss, not corresponding to the typical shake-up features observed in Cu(II). Therefore, the shake-up mechanism is effectively \"turned off\" in Cu(I) compounds.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A:** This statement correctly identifies that the incompletely filled $3d^9$ shell of Cu(II) allows for the shake-up excitation, while the completely filled $3d^{10}$ shell of Cu(I) forbids it. This is the correct explanation.\n*   **B:** While crystal structure can subtly influence electronic properties, it is not the fundamental reason. The core of the phenomenon is the intra-atomic electronic configuration, not the inter-atomic distances.\n*   **C:** This confuses cause and effect. The shake-up process itself lowers the kinetic energy. The probability of the event is determined by the availability of final states and transition moments, not by the kinetic energy of the main peak.\n*   **D:** This incorrectly identifies the satellite as a plasmon loss peak. Plasmons are collective excitations of a free electron gas, and while they can cause loss features in XPS, they are a distinct phenomenon from shake-up satellites, which are a quantum mechanical two-electron transitions localized on an atom or molecule.\n*   **E:** This statement incorrectly describes the relative orbital energies and misapplies the concept. While ligand-to-metal charge transfer is involved in the shake-up process for CuO, the core reason it happens in CuO but not Cu₂O is the presence of the 3d hole in Cu(II), not a reversal of orbital energy ordering.\n\nTherefore, the presence or absence of the shake-up satellite is a powerful diagnostic tool in XPS for distinguishing between Cu(I) and Cu(II) oxidation states, and it is directly rooted in their differing 3d electronic configurations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1347622"}]}
