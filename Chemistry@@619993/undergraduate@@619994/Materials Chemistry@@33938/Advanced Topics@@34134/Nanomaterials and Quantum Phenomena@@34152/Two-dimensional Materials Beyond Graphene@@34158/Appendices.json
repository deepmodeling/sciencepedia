One common top-down method is liquid-phase exfoliation, where a bulk layered material is sonicated in a suitable solvent. The efficiency of this process critically depends on the energetic favorability of separating the material's layers within the solvent. A successful exfoliation is typically achieved when the cohesive energy of the solvent closely matches the interlayer binding energy of the solid.\n\nThe Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSPs) provide a powerful framework for predicting solvent-material compatibility. Each material (solute or solvent) is characterized by a set of three parameters: $\\delta_D$ for nonpolar dispersion interactions, $\\delta_P$ for polar dipole-dipole interactions, and $\\delta_H$ for hydrogen bonding interactions. The similarity between a solvent (subscript 1) and a solute (subscript 2) can be quantified by calculating the Hansen solubility distance, $R_a$, using the following equation:\n\n$$R_a = \\sqrt{4(\\delta_{D,1} - \\delta_{D,2})^2 + (\\delta_{P,1} - \\delta_{P,2})^2 + (\\delta_{H,1} - \\delta_{H,2})^2}$$\n\nA smaller value of $R_a$ indicates a better match and therefore a more effective solvent for exfoliation.\n\nA research group is attempting to exfoliate bulk hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) to produce h-BN nanosheets.

Mastering this skill is vital for connecting atomic-scale structure to the macroscopic properties that determine a material's utility.", "problem": "An inorganic chemist is investigating the electronic properties of point defects in a synthetic monolayer of Molybdenum Diselenide ($MoSe_2$), a two-dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD). The pristine monolayer is a semiconductor with an electronic band gap of $E_g = 1.65 \\text{ eV}$. Using a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM), the chemist identifies two distinct, naturally occurring point defects, labeled Defect A and Defect B. Through chemical analysis and imaging, these are determined to be a Molybdenum (Mo) adatom adsorbed on the surface and a Selenium (Se) monovacancy within the lattice.\n\nTo probe the local electronic structure, Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) is performed directly over each defect site. STS measures the differential conductance ($dI/dV$), which is proportional to the local density of electronic states (LDOS). The energy scale is referenced to the sample's Fermi level ($E_F$), which lies within the band gap. By convention, a positive sample bias voltage ($V$) probes unoccupied states above $E_F$, and a negative bias probes occupied states below $E_F$. The pristine material shows zero LDOS between a sample bias of $-1.00 \\text{ V}$ (Valence Band Maximum, VBM) and $+0.65 \\text{ V}$ (Conduction Band Minimum, CBM).\n\nThe STS measurements yield the following results:\n- **Spectrum A (at Defect A):** A sharp peak in the LDOS is observed at a sample bias of $+0.50 \\text{ V}$.\n- **Spectrum B (at Defect B):** A prominent peak in the LDOS is observed at a sample bias of $-0.80 \\text{ V}$.\n\nBased on fundamental principles of solid-state and defect chemistry, identify which defect corresponds to which spectrum and select the option that provides the correct physical justification for the assignment.\n\nA. Defect A is the Se vacancy and Defect B is the Mo adatom. The Se vacancy is electropositive, creating an unoccupied donor state near the CBM, while the metallic Mo adatom pulls electron density from the lattice, creating an occupied acceptor state near the VBM.\n\nB. Defect A is the Mo adatom and Defect B is the Se vacancy. The Mo adatom acts as an electron donor, introducing a shallow, unoccupied donor state just below the CBM. The Se vacancy creates unsaturated Mo dangling bonds, resulting in a deep, occupied, localized state with energy close to the VBM.\n\nC. Defect A is the Mo adatom and Defect B is the Se vacancy. The Mo adatom is large and sterically hinders electronic states, pushing them from the VBM into the gap. The small Se vacancy allows for electronic relaxation, creating a shallow state just below the CBM.\n\nD. Defect A is the Se vacancy and Defect B is the Mo adatom. The Se vacancy breaks the symmetry of the lattice, which by group theory selection rules, must create a state near the middle of the band gap. The Mo adatom, being metallic, contributes states that hybridize equally with the valence and conduction bands.\n\nE. It is impossible to distinguish between these two defects using STS, as both are expected to create mid-gap states due to the disruption of the crystal lattice. The observed difference is likely due to experimental artifact or substrate effects.", "solution": "We begin with the STS principle that the measured differential conductance is proportional to the local density of states: $dI/dV \\propto \\rho(E)$. By the stated convention, a positive sample bias $V>0$ probes unoccupied states at energies $E>E_{F}$, and a negative bias $V<0$ probes occupied states at energies $E<E_{F}$.

Donor states in semiconductors typically lie just below the CBM. Given $E_{A}$ is unoccupied and within $0.15 \\text{ eV}$ of the CBM, it is consistent with a donor-like state associated with the Mo adatom. The state appears at positive bias because, relative to $E_{F}$, it is above $E_{F}$ and hence unoccupied in the tunneling measurement.\n\n2) A Se monovacancy removes a chalcogen and leaves neighboring Mo atoms with unsaturated $d$-orbital dangling bonds, which form localized in-gap states. A prominent consequence is an occupied localized state lying near the VBM due to bonding combinations of Mo $d$ states. The peak at $E_{B}$, an occupied state close to the VBM, is consistent with such a Se vacancy-induced state.\n\nThese assignments directly map to the option that identifies Defect A as the Mo adatom with a shallow unoccupied donor state near the CBM, and Defect B as the Se vacancy producing an occupied localized state near the VBM. That description is precisely given by option B. The alternative options either invert donor/acceptor character, invoke incorrect steric or symmetry arguments, or claim non-distinguishability inconsistent with the clear bias-dependent in-gap signatures.\n\nTherefore, Defect A corresponds to the Mo adatom (Spectrum A at positive bias near the CBM), and Defect B corresponds to the Se vacancy (Spectrum B at negative bias near the VBM), with the stated justifications.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1345559"}, {"introduction": "Far from being mere imperfections, defects can be deliberately engineered to create novel functionalities, pushing 2D materials into the realm of quantum technology.
