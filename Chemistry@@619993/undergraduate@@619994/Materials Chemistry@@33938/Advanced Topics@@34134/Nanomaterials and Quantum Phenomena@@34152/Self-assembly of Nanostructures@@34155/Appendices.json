The surfactant molecules are amphiphilic, meaning they have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. At low concentrations in an aqueous solution, these molecules exist as individual solvated ions. However, above a certain concentration, they spontaneously assemble into spherical aggregates called micelles. This concentration is known as the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC).\n\nTo determine the CMC of this surfactant, the student prepares a series of aqueous solutions at different concentrations and measures their specific conductivity, $\\kappa$. The rationale is that individual surfactant ions are mobile charge carriers, while the larger, slower-moving micelles contribute differently to the overall conductivity. This leads to a distinct change in the relationship between conductivity and concentration at the CMC.\n\nThe experimental data collected at a constant temperature are provided in the table below:\n\n| Concentration, $C$ (mM) | Specific Conductivity, $\\kappa$ (mS/cm) |\n| :---------------------: | :-------------------------------------: |\n|          1.00           |                  10.1                   |\n|          2.00           |                  20.3                   |\n|          4.00           |                  39.8                   |\n|          6.00           |                  60.5                   |\n|          10.0           |                  86.2                   |\n|          12.0           |                  92.0                   |\n|          14.0           |                  98.3                   |\n|          16.0           |                  104.1                  |\n\nAssuming that the relationship between specific conductivity and concentration can be modeled by two distinct linear regions (one below the CMC and one above the CMC), calculate the value of the Critical Micelle Concentration.\n\nExpress your answer in units of mM, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Micelle formation causes a change in the slope of specific conductivity versus concentration.
