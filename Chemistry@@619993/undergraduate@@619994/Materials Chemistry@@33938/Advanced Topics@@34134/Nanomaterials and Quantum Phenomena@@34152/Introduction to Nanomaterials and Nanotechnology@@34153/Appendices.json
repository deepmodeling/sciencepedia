We can achieve this by first finding the number of particles in the sample and then multiplying this number by the surface area of a single particle.\n\nFirst, let's define the properties of a single nanoparticle.\nThe shape is a sphere with diameter $d$. The radius is $r = d/2$.\nThe surface area of a single spherical nanoparticle, $A_{particle}$, is given by the formula:\n$$A_{particle} = 4\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi d^2$$\nThe volume of a single spherical nanoparticle, $V_{particle}$, is given by:\n$$V_{particle} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3$$\n\nNext, we can determine the mass of a single nanoparticle, $m_{particle}$, using its volume and the given material density, $\\rho$:\n$$m_{particle} = \\rho \\cdot V_{particle} = \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3\\right)$$\n\nThe total number of nanoparticles, $N$, in the sample can be found by dividing the total mass of the sample, $m_{total}$, by the mass of a single particle, $m_{particle}$:\n$$N = \\frac{m_{total}}{m_{particle}} = \\frac{m_{total}}{\\frac{1}{6}\\pi \\rho d^3}$$\n\nThe total surface area, $A_{total}$, is the number of particles, $N$, multiplied by the surface area of one particle, $A_{particle}$:\n$$A_{total} = N \\cdot A_{particle} = \\left(\\frac{m_{total}}{\\frac{1}{6}\\pi \\rho d^3}\\right) \\cdot (\\pi d^2)$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling terms:\n$$A_{total} = \\frac{m_{total} \\cdot \\pi d^2}{\\frac{1}{6}\\pi \\rho d^3} = \\frac{6 m_{total}}{\\rho d}$$\nThis elegant result shows that for a given mass of spherical particles, the total surface area is inversely proportional to the particle diameter.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values.

For an ideal, infinitely large crystal, each set of lattice planes produces a delta-function-like peak at its Bragg angle because the number of coherently scattering planes is unbounded.\n\nIn a crystallite of finite size $L$ along the diffraction vector, only a finite number of parallel planes contribute coherently. The diffracted amplitude is the finite sum of a geometric series, which yields a main lobe whose angular width is inversely proportional to the number of planes (equivalently, to $L$).

Since both samples are measured with the same Cu K-alpha source, $\\lambda$ is the same, and since both are anatase, the $d$ spacings and therefore peak positions are the same; the dominant cause of different widths is crystallite size (and possibly microstrain).\n\nStrain can also broaden peaks.

By comparing two formulations, you will learn how electrostatic repulsion can be engineered to counteract aggregation and how to interpret zeta potential values to predict the long-term stability of a nanoparticle dispersion.

For the system to be effective, the nanoparticles must remain individually dispersed in an aqueous solution for an extended period, a property known as colloidal stability.

Formulation A is more stable because the lower magnitude of its zeta potential indicates weaker overall inter-particle forces, which reduces the likelihood of collision and aggregation.\n\nB. Formulation B is more stable because the higher magnitude of its zeta potential signifies stronger electrostatic repulsion between particles, which creates a larger energy barrier against the attractive van der Waals forces that cause aggregation.\n\nC.

The repulsive term $V_{R}(h)$ arises from overlapping electric double layers and, for like-charged particles in an electrolyte, decays roughly exponentially with $h$ and increases with the square of the surface potential. Using the zeta potential $\\zeta$ as an experimentally accessible proxy for the surface potential, the repulsive contribution scales as\n$$\nV_{R}(h) \\propto \\zeta^{2} \\exp(-\\kappa h),\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the inverse Debye screening length and the proportionality constant depends on the dielectric permittivity and particle geometry. Consequently, increasing $|\\zeta|$ increases the height of the electrostatic energy barrier that separates particles from the primary minimum associated with van der Waals attraction.\n\nThe kinetic stability against aggregation can be quantified by the Fuchs stability ratio $W$, which depends exponentially on the energy barrier height $\\Delta V_{\\max}$:\n$$\nW \\sim \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\max}}{k_{B} T}\\right).\n$$\nBecause $\\Delta V_{\\max}$ increases with $\\zeta^{2}$ for fixed ionic strength and particle size, a higher magnitude of the zeta potential corresponds to a larger $W$, i.e., a much lower aggregation rate and greater long-term stability.\n\nComparing the two formulations, Formulation B has a larger magnitude of zeta potential than Formulation A. Therefore, at the same ionic strength and particle size, Formulation B will have a larger electrostatic repulsive barrier, a larger stability ratio, and thus superior long-term colloidal stability. This directly supports the statement that stronger electrostatic repulsion counteracts the ever-present attractive van der Waals forces.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n\nA is incorrect. A lower magnitude $|\\zeta|$ reduces electrostatic repulsion. Since $V_{A}(h)$ remains attractive, decreasing $V_{R}(h)$ lowers the barrier $\\Delta V_{\\max}$ and increases the probability that collisions lead to aggregation. There is no mechanism by which a smaller $|\\zeta|$ reduces collision frequency; rather, it reduces the energy barrier to sticking.\n\nB is correct. A higher magnitude $|\\zeta|$ increases $V_{R}(h)$ and thereby increases $\\Delta V_{\\max}$, producing a larger energetic barrier that opposes the van der Waals attraction and decreases the aggregation rate, consistent with $W \\sim \\exp(\\Delta V_{\\max}/(k_{B} T))$.\n\nC is incorrect. A negative zeta potential indicates like-charged particles with net electrostatic repulsion, not attraction. It is the magnitude of $|\\zeta|$, not its sign alone, that primarily determines the strength of repulsion and hence stability under otherwise fixed conditions.\n\nD is incorrect. While particle size and concentration influence collision rates and sedimentation, the zeta potential is a primary determinant of electrostatic repulsive barriers in DLVO theory.
