Therefore, moving from water to DMSO, where $n$ (and hence $\\varepsilon_{d}$) is larger, causes the LSPR peak to shift to a longer wavelength, i.e., a red-shift.\n\nThus, the correct choice is a red-shift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1323946"}, {"introduction": "While predicting spectral shifts is a valuable skill, a practicing scientist often faces the inverse challenge: interpreting experimental data to understand an unknown sample. A UV-Vis absorption spectrum contains a wealth of information. This problem challenges you to act as an experimentalist and deduce the most likely material, shape, and size uniformity of a nanoparticle sample based on a single LSPR spectrum [@problem_id:1323903]. This practice hones your ability to synthesize knowledge about how different physical parameters collectively shape the optical signature of plasmonic nanoparticles.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is working on synthesizing metallic nanoparticles in a colloidal suspension where the solvent is pure water. The synthesis is intended to produce particles of a single noble metal. To characterize the product, the researcher uses an Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrometer. The resulting absorption spectrum reveals a single, well-defined, and sharp absorption peak with a maximum at a wavelength of $\\lambda_{max} = 520$ nm. This characteristic absorption is due to a phenomenon known as Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR), which is the resonant oscillation of conduction electrons on the nanoparticle surface excited by incident light.\n\nBased on this single experimental observation, which of the following statements presents the most likely conclusion about the composition and physical characteristics of the nanoparticles in the solution?\n\nA.

For subwavelength spherical particles, the quasi-static (electrostatic) approximation applies, and the dipolar LSPR occurs when the real part of the metal dielectric function satisfies the resonance condition\n$$\n\\Re\\{\\epsilon_{\\text{metal}}(\\omega_{\\text{res}})\\}=-2\\,\\epsilon_{m},\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{m}$ is the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium (here, pure water), and $\\omega_{\\text{res}}$ is the angular frequency corresponding to the LSPR. The absorption cross-section near resonance is governed by the polarizability\n$$\n\\alpha(\\omega)=4\\pi R^{3}\\,\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{metal}}(\\omega)-\\epsilon_{m}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{metal}}(\\omega)+2\\,\\epsilon_{m}},\n$$\nand the absorption line shape is proportional to $\\Im\\{\\alpha(\\omega)\\}$.

For the same $\\epsilon_{m}$, different metals have different $\\epsilon_{\\text{metal}}(\\omega)$, so their LSPR wavelengths differ. In water, spherical gold nanoparticles exhibit an LSPR near $\\lambda\\approx 520$ nm, whereas spherical silver nanoparticles exhibit an LSPR at substantially shorter wavelengths (in the blue, well below 500 nm), because for silver the resonance condition $\\Re\\{\\epsilon_{\\text{Ag}}(\\omega)\\}=-2\\,\\epsilon_{m}$ is satisfied at higher photon energies than for gold. Thus, an LSPR maximum at $520$ nm in water is consistent with gold, not silver.\n\nThe peak shape and multiplicity further constrain shape and size dispersion. Anisotropic shapes such as nanorods support multiple plasmon modes: a transverse mode near the spherical resonance and a longitudinal mode at longer wavelengths set by the aspect ratio. Therefore, gold nanorods typically show two distinct LSPR peaks rather than a single one. The observation of a single, well-defined and sharp peak strongly indicates spherical particles and a narrow size distribution. A broad size distribution of spheres would yield a broadened, less sharp peak due to the integral over $R$ above. Finally, CdSe quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals that exhibit excitonic absorption features rather than metallic LSPR; their spectra are not described by the above plasmonic resonance condition and therefore are inconsistent with the observed single sharp LSPR at $520$ nm.\n\nTherefore, the most likely conclusion is that the solution contains spherical gold nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1323903"}, {"introduction": "Our exploration so far has focused on isolated nanoparticles. In reality, nanoparticles often aggregate or are deliberately assembled into complex architectures, leading to fascinating new optical properties. This exercise moves beyond the single-particle picture to explore the phenomenon of plasmon coupling, where the LSPR of one nanoparticle is influenced by its neighbors [@problem_id:1323958].

The nanorods are stabilized by a capping agent that prevents aggregation. An optical extinction spectrum of this stable dispersion reveals two absorption peaks characteristic of the nanorods' Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR): a weaker transverse LSPR peak at 520 nm and a strong, prominent longitudinal LSPR peak at 750 nm.\n\nThe student then divides the dispersion into two batches to conduct two different experiments.\n\n**Experiment 1**: To the first batch, the student adds a bifunctional linker molecule that selectively binds to the ends of the gold nanorods. This process induces the nanorods to self-assemble predominantly in an end-to-end configuration, forming linear chains.\n\n**Experiment 2**: To the second batch, the student adds a high concentration of salt. This destabilizes the colloid by screening the surface charges, causing the nanorods to aggregate. Further analysis shows that this process results primarily in side-by-side bundling of the nanorods.\n\nFor each experiment, the student records the change in the longitudinal LSPR peak.

For the longitudinal mode of an elongated particle, increasing the aspect ratio decreases $L_{\\text{long}}$, which requires $\\Re[\\epsilon(\\omega)]$ to be more negative, realized at a lower $\\omega$ (longer $\\lambda$), i.e., a red-shift.\n\nTo determine how assembly changes the longitudinal LSPR, we use plasmon hybridization or the coupled-dipole picture. The leading interaction between two longitudinal dipoles $\\mathbf{p}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{p}_{2}$ separated by vector $\\mathbf{r}$ in a medium with permittivity $\\epsilon_{m}$ is given by the dipole-dipole energy\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{m}}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_{2}}{r^{3}} - 3\\frac{(\\mathbf{p}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})(\\mathbf{p}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})}{r^{5}}\\right).\n$$\nFor end-to-end alignment, $\\mathbf{r}\\parallel \\mathbf{p}_{1}\\parallel \\mathbf{p}_{2}$, so $\\mathbf{p}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_{2}=p^{2}$ and $(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})=pr$, yielding\n$$\nU_{\\text{end}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{m}}\\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{r^{3}} - 3\\frac{p^{2}r^{2}}{r^{5}}\\right) = -\\frac{2p^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{m}r^{3}}<0.\n$$\nThis attractive coupling stabilizes the bonding longitudinal plasmon, lowering its energy (decreasing $\\omega$) and thus red-shifting $\\lambda$. In addition, end-to-end chaining effectively increases the longitudinal extent (aspect ratio increases), which by the depolarization-factor argument above further red-shifts the longitudinal LSPR. Therefore, Experiment 1 produces a red-shift.\n\nFor side-by-side alignment, $\\mathbf{r}\\perp \\mathbf{p}_{1}\\parallel \\mathbf{p}_{2}$, so $(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})=0$ and\n$$\nU_{\\text{side}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{m}}\\frac{p^{2}}{r^{3}}>0.\n$$\nThis repulsive coupling destabilizes the bonding longitudinal mode, raising its energy (increasing $\\omega$) and blue-shifting $\\lambda$. Moreover, side-by-side bundling increases the cross-sectional area while keeping length similar, decreasing the aspect ratio and thereby increasing $L_{\\text{long}}$, which shifts the longitudinal resonance to higher frequency (shorter wavelength) according to the quasistatic resonance condition. Hence, Experiment 2 produces a blue-shift.\n\nCombining these results: Experiment 1 yields a red-shift of the longitudinal LSPR peak; Experiment 2 yields a blue-shift.
