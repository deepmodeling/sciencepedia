For amphoteric materials, the surface charge is highly dependent on the pH of the surrounding aqueous medium. The pH at which the net surface charge of a particle is zero is defined as its Isoelectric Point (IEP).\n\nConsider two different types of nanoparticles: zinc oxide ($\\text{ZnO}$) and silicon dioxide ($\\text{SiO}_2$), also known as silica. The IEP for $\\text{ZnO}$ is approximately at a pH of 9.0, while the IEP for $\\text{SiO}_2$ is approximately at a pH of 2.0.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where two separate, stable aqueous colloidal suspensions are prepared. The first suspension contains $ZnO$ nanoparticles, and the second contains $SiO_2$ nanoparticles. The pH of both suspensions is carefully adjusted to and maintained at 6.0. Afterwards, the two suspensions are mixed together.\n\nAssuming no other chemical reactions occur, what is the most likely immediate outcome upon mixing these two suspensions?\n\nA. The mixture remains a stable colloidal suspension.\n\nB. The particles from both suspensions repel each other strongly, enhancing the overall stability of the mixture.\n\nC. A vigorous chemical reaction occurs, producing a new soluble compound.\n\nD. The particles from both suspensions attract each other, leading to aggregation and eventual sedimentation.\n\nE.

For oxide surfaces bearing hydroxyl groups, the surface equilibria are\n$$\\equiv MOH + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\equiv MOH_{2}^{+}, \\quad \\equiv MOH \\rightleftharpoons \\equiv MO^{-} + H^{+}.$$\nBy definition, at the IEP the net surface charge is zero. For $pH$ values below the IEP, protonation dominates and the surface is positively charged; for $pH$ values above the IEP, deprotonation dominates and the surface is negatively charged.\n\nApply this to each nanoparticle at $pH=6.0$:\n- For $\\text{ZnO}$ with IEP at $pH \\approx 9.0$, we have $6.0 < 9.0$, so the $\\text{ZnO}$ surface is positively charged.\n- For $\\text{SiO}_2$ with IEP at $pH \\approx 2.0$, we have $6.0 > 2.0$, so the $\\text{SiO}_2$ surface is negatively charged.\n\nWhen the two suspensions at the same $pH$ are mixed (and assuming $pH$ remains near $6.0$ and no other reactions occur), the oppositely charged particles experience electrostatic attraction. According to DLVO theory, this attraction reduces or eliminates electrostatic repulsion, allowing van der Waals attraction to dominate, which promotes heteroaggregation (coagulation) and leads to eventual sedimentation.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A and B require net repulsion or maintained stability, which is not the case with opposite charges.\n- C is incorrect because no vigorous chemical reaction is expected under the stated conditions.\n- E is incorrect because neither $\\text{ZnO}$ nor $\\text{SiO}_2$ dissolves completely at $pH=6.0$ under typical conditions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate outcome is aggregation and sedimentation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1348152"}, {"introduction": "After grasping the concept of the isoelectric point, the next step is learning how to determine it from experimental data.
