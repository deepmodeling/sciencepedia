A key performance metric for these materials is their ability to self-heal after sustaining mechanical damage, thereby extending the device's operational lifetime. The effectiveness of the repair process is quantified by the healing efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of a specific mechanical property measured after a healing cycle to the same property of the original, undamaged material.\n\nThe team focuses on fracture toughness ($K_{IC}$), also known as the critical stress intensity factor, as the key property. In a standard test, a pristine sample of the newly developed polymer is measured to have a fracture toughness of $1.35 \\text{ MPa} \\cdot \\text{m}^{1/2}$. Following this measurement, a controlled crack is introduced into the sample. The sample is then subjected to a specific thermo-mechanical healing process. After the process is complete, the fracture toughness of the now-healed material is re-measured and found to be $1.05 \\text{ MPa} \\cdot \\text{m}^{1/2}$.\n\nBased on these experimental values, calculate the healing efficiency of the polymer composite.

Consider a simplified model where a microcrack is represented as a long, cylindrical capillary with a uniform radius $r$. The polymer matrix is hydrophobic, and the aqueous healing agent has a surface tension of $\\gamma$. The interaction between the liquid agent and the capillary wall is characterized by a contact angle $\\theta$, which is known to be greater than $90^\\circ$.\n\nWhen the liquid agent is released from a ruptured capsule into a bulk reservoir, it forms a meniscus at the entrance of the crack. To overcome the natural resistance of the liquid to enter the hydrophobic crack (an effect known as poor wetting), an external mechanical load is applied, creating an excess pressure, $P_{applied}$, on the bulk liquid agent. The total pressure of the bulk liquid agent is thus $P_0 + P_{applied}$, where $P_0$ is the ambient pressure. Assume the crack is open at its far end, allowing the gas within to remain at the constant ambient pressure $P_0$.\n\nDetermine the minimum applied pressure, $P_{min}$, that must be exerted on the bulk liquid agent to initiate its flow into the crack. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $\\gamma$, $r$, and $\\theta$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum applied pressure, $P_{min}$, required to force a non-wetting liquid into a capillary. This is a problem of pressure balance at the liquid-gas interface (meniscus).\n\nFirst, let's define the pressures involved in the system:\n1.  The pressure of the gas inside the capillary crack is given as the constant ambient pressure, $P_{gas} = P_0$.\n2.  The pressure of the bulk liquid agent in the reservoir outside the crack is the ambient pressure plus the applied pressure, $P_{bulk} = P_0 + P_{applied}$.\n3.  Let $P_{liquid}$ be the pressure of the liquid right at the meniscus, on the liquid side of the interface.\n\nThe pressure difference across a curved liquid-gas interface in a cylindrical capillary is described by the Young-Laplace equation:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_{inside} - P_{outside} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nIn this context, we can consider the \"inside\" to be the gas phase and the \"outside\" to be the liquid phase, as the center of curvature of the meniscus is in the gas phase for a non-wetting liquid ($\\theta > 90^\\circ$). Thus, we can write:\n$$ P_{gas} - P_{liquid} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nAlternatively, a more general form is that the pressure is higher on the concave side of the interface. For a non-wetting liquid where $\\theta > 90^\\circ$, the meniscus is convex as viewed from the liquid, making the liquid pressure higher than it would be for a flat surface. Let's use the convention $\\Delta P = P_{liquid} - P_{gas}$, which gives:\n$$ P_{liquid} - P_{gas} = -\\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nWe can now express the pressure of the liquid just inside the meniscus, $P_{liquid}$, in terms of the gas pressure $P_0$:\n$$ P_{liquid} = P_{gas} - \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} = P_0 - \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nFor the liquid to begin flowing into the capillary, the pressure of the bulk liquid, $P_{bulk}$, must be at least as great as the pressure of the liquid just inside the meniscus, $P_{liquid}$. The minimum condition for flow to be initiated is when these two pressures are equal:\n$$ P_{bulk} = P_{liquid} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_{bulk}$ and $P_{liquid}$ at the minimum applied pressure ($P_{applied} = P_{min}$):\n$$ P_0 + P_{min} = P_0 - \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nThe ambient pressure terms, $P_0$, cancel out from both sides of the equation:\n$$ P_{min} = - \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nThis is the minimum applied pressure required. Let's check the sign. The problem states that the liquid is non-wetting, so $\\theta > 90^\\circ$. In this case, $\\cos\\theta$ is negative. Therefore, the term $-\\cos\\theta$ is positive, and since $\\gamma$ and $r$ are also positive, the required minimum pressure $P_{min}$ is positive. This makes physical sense, as an external pressure must be actively applied to force the liquid into the capillary against the repulsive surface tension forces.

The flow of the healing agent is laminar and can be described by a relationship analogous to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. For this specific geometry of flow between two parallel plates, the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, of a fluid with viscosity $\\eta$ through a channel section of length $L$ is given by:\n$$Q = \\frac{w H^3 \\Delta P}{12 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop over the length $L$.\n\nThe healing agent is a monomer that polymerizes upon contact with a catalyst dispersed in the composite matrix.
