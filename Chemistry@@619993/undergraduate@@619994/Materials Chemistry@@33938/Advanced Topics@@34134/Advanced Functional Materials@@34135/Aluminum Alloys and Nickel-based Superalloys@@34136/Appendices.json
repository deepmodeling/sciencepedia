Let $T_{\\text{solvus}}(C_{0})$ denote the solvus temperature for the $\\alpha$ phase at composition $C_{0}$, and let $C_{\\alpha}^{\\text{eq}}(T)$ be the equilibrium solubility of Cu in $\\alpha$ at temperature $T$.

Effective precipitation strengthening requires three conditions:\n(1) Solutionizing in a single-phase $\\alpha$ field so that all prior $\\theta$ dissolves, which demands $T_{\\text{solvus}}(C_{0}) < T_{\\text{solution}} < T_{\\text{solidus}}(C_{0})$ (for Al-Cu on the Al-rich side this also means $T_{\\text{solution}}$ below the eutectic at $548\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$),\n(2) a quench to retain a supersaturated $\\alpha$ with solute content approximately $C_{0}$, and\n(3) aging at a temperature where $C_{0} > C_{\\alpha}^{\\text{eq}}(T_{\\text{age}})$ so that fine $\\theta$ precipitates form and strengthen the alloy.\n\nGiven data: the maximum solubility in $\\alpha$ is $5.65$ wt% at $548\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; at $150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $C_{\\alpha}^{\\text{eq}}(150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) \\approx 0.2$ wt%; for $C_{0}=4.0$ wt% Cu, $T_{\\text{solvus}}=500\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nEvaluate each option against the above conditions.\n\nOption A (Al-0.1 wt% Cu; heat to $520\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, quench, age at $150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): Although $T_{\\text{solution}}=520\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is in the single-phase $\\alpha$ field for $C_{0}=0.1$ and the quench would retain that composition, the supersaturation condition fails at aging because $C_{0}=0.1 < C_{\\alpha}^{\\text{eq}}(150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) \\approx 0.2$. Thus $f_{\\theta}(150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) \\propto C_{0} - C_{\\alpha}^{\\text{eq}}(150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) < 0$ (physically, zero), so no strengthening precipitates form. Not effective.\n\nOption B (Al-4.0 wt% Cu; heat to $520\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, slow furnace cool): Here $T_{\\text{solution}}=520\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ satisfies $T_{\\text{solvus}}(4.0)=500\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} < 520\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} < 548\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, so a single-phase $\\alpha$ can be obtained. However, slow cooling allows equilibrium precipitation during cooling, producing coarse $\\theta$ and exhausting supersaturation before room temperature. Without a quench to retain a supersaturated $\\alpha$, aging-type fine precipitation is not achieved, and strengthening is not effective.\n\nOption C (Al-4.0 wt% Cu; heat to $450\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, quench, age at $150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): Since $T_{\\text{solution}}=450\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} < T_{\\text{solvus}}(4.0)=500\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the microstructure at $450\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is $\\alpha + \\theta$, and prior $\\theta$ does not dissolve. The quench then retains undissolved second phase and an $\\alpha$ not at $C_{0}$, so the supersaturation is insufficient for effective precipitation during aging. Not effective.\n\nOption D (Al-8.0 wt% Cu; heat to $560\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, quench, age at $150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): The composition $C_{0}=8.0$ wt% exceeds the maximum $\\alpha$ solubility of $5.65$ wt% at $548\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. There is no sub-liquidus temperature at which a single-phase $\\alpha$ of $8.0$ wt% Cu exists; raising to $560\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} > 548\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ enters a regime with liquid present, risking incipient melting and preventing full dissolution into $\\alpha$. Therefore, a homogeneous supersaturated $\\alpha$ cannot be obtained. Not effective.\n\nOption E (Al-4.0 wt% Cu; heat to $520\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, quench, age at $150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): This satisfies $T_{\\text{solvus}}(4.0)=500\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} < 520\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} < 548\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ so that a single-phase $\\alpha$ at $C_{0}=4.0$ wt% is achieved. The quench retains a supersaturated $\\alpha$ of composition approximately $C_{0}$. At $T_{\\text{age}}=150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $C_{0} - C_{\\alpha}^{\\text{eq}}(150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) \\approx 4.0 - 0.2 > 0$, providing a strong thermodynamic driving force for fine $\\theta$ precipitation during aging. This is the standard and effective precipitation-strengthening protocol.\n\nTherefore, only option E meets all requirements for effective precipitation strengthening.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1281476"}, {"introduction": "Nickel-based superalloys are engineering marvels, capable of withstanding extreme temperatures inside jet engines.

The high-temperature strength of this alloy relies on a dispersion of coherent, ordered $L1_2$ precipitates (the $\\gamma'$ phase) within a face-centered cubic solid-solution matrix (the $\\gamma$ phase). The coherency and morphology of these precipitates, which are critical for strength, are strongly influenced by the lattice misfit, $\\delta$, between the two phases.\n\nThe misfit is defined as $\\delta = \\frac{2(a_{\\gamma'} - a_{\\gamma})}{a_{\\gamma'} + a_{\\gamma}}$, where $a_{\\gamma'}$ and $a_{\\gamma}$ are the lattice parameters of the precipitate and matrix, respectively. Both lattice parameters are dependent on temperature, $T$. This dependence can be modeled using a linear thermal expansion model starting from a reference temperature, $T_{ref}$. The lattice parameter $a(T)$ of a phase at a temperature $T$ is given by $a(T) = a_{ref}[1 + \\alpha(T - T_{ref})]$, where $a_{ref}$ is the lattice parameter at $T_{ref}$ and $\\alpha$ is the mean coefficient of linear thermal expansion.\n\nThe new alloy has the following properties:\n- Reference temperature, $T_{ref} = 300 \\text{ K}$.\n- For the $\\gamma$ matrix: $a_{\\gamma, ref} = 3.5850$ Å and $\\alpha_{\\gamma} = 12.50 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ K}^{-1}$.\n- For the $\\gamma'$ precipitate: $a_{\\gamma', ref} = 3.5862$ Å and $\\alpha_{\\gamma'} = 15.20 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ K}^{-1}$.\n\nFor optimal mechanical properties and to prevent the loss of coherency at high temperatures, the athermal component of the misfit must be kept under a critical positive value.
