This practice simulates the foundational process of characterizing a new material by measuring its critical temperature, $T_c$. You will explore two of the most important experimental signatures of superconductivity: the abrupt drop of electrical resistance to zero and the onset of perfect diamagnetism via the Meissner effect, highlighting how a definitive $T_c$ is established from experimental data [@problem_id:1338551].", "problem": "A materials chemist is investigating a newly synthesized ceramic compound, a variant of Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO), for its potential high-temperature superconducting properties. To characterize the material's transition to the superconducting state, two separate experiments are conducted as the sample is cooled in a cryostat.\n\n**Experiment 1: Electrical Resistance Measurement**\nThe electrical resistance, $R$, of the material is measured using a four-point probe. In the normal conducting state, the resistance is found to decrease linearly with temperature, $T$. This behavior is well-described by the empirical relation:\n$R(T) = R_{ref} [1 + \\alpha(T - T_{ref})]$\nwhere the resistance at the reference temperature $T_{ref} = 95.00$ K is $R_{ref} = 1.15$ m$\\Omega$, and the temperature coefficient of resistance is $\\alpha = -9.20 \\times 10^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$. Below a certain temperature, the resistance abruptly drops to a value experimentally indistinguishable from zero. This resistive critical temperature is precisely measured to be $T_{c,R} = 92.83$ K.\n\n**Experiment 2: Magnetic Susceptibility Measurement**\nThe sample is cooled in a zero-field environment and then a small, constant magnetic field is applied. The sample's magnetic susceptibility, $\\chi$, is measured as the temperature is slowly increased. The material exhibits perfect diamagnetism (the Meissner effect) in its superconducting state. As the temperature rises, it transitions to a weakly paramagnetic state. The temperature at which the diamagnetic signal vanishes is identified as the magnetic critical temperature, $T_{c,M}$. This transition is experimentally determined to occur at $T_{c,M} = 92.15$ K.\n\nFor a comprehensive characterization of the material, a single, representative critical temperature, $T_c$, is often reported. Assuming the resistive and magnetic transitions are equally valid definitions for the onset of superconductivity, calculate the average critical temperature, $T_c$, for this new YBCO variant. Express your answer in Kelvin (K), rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine a single representative critical temperature, $T_c$, for a new superconducting material by averaging the critical temperatures obtained from two different experimental methods: electrical resistance measurement and magnetic susceptibility measurement.\n\nFirst, we must identify the relevant data provided in the problem statement. The description of the material's properties provides two distinct values for the critical temperature.\n\nFrom Experiment 1, the electrical resistance measurement, the resistive critical temperature is given directly as:\n$T_{c,R} = 92.83 \\text{ K}$\nThe information regarding the linear resistance model, $R(T) = R_{ref} [1 + \\alpha(T - T_{ref})]$, along with the values for $R_{ref}$, $T_{ref}$, and $\\alpha$, describes the material's behavior in the normal state but is not required to determine the average critical temperature, as $T_{c,R}$ is explicitly stated.\n\nFrom Experiment 2, the magnetic susceptibility measurement, the magnetic critical temperature (associated with the Meissner effect) is given as:\n$T_{c,M} = 92.15 \\text{ K}$\n\nThe problem states that the representative critical temperature, $T_c$, should be calculated as the average of these two measured values. The formula for the arithmetic average of two numbers is:\n$T_c = \\frac{T_{c,R} + T_{c,M}}{2}$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula:\n$T_c = \\frac{92.83 \\text{ K} + 92.15 \\text{ K}}{2}$\n\nPerforming the addition in the numerator:\n$T_c = \\frac{184.98 \\text{ K}}{2}$\n\nFinally, we perform the division:\n$T_c = 92.49 \\text{ K}$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value, $92.49$, already consists of four significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{92.49}$$", "id": "1338551"}, {"introduction": "Once a material is confirmed to be a superconductor, the next critical step is to classify its type. This exercise guides you through interpreting the magnetic behavior of a superconductor to distinguish between Type I and Type II materials. Understanding this distinction is not merely academic; it is fundamental to determining a material's potential applications, as the two types interact with magnetic fields in vastly different ways [@problem_id:1338548].", "problem": "A materials scientist synthesizes a novel crystalline compound and investigates its magnetic properties at a temperature of $4.2 \\text{ K}$, which is well below its suspected superconducting critical temperature, $T_c$. The magnetization, $M$, of the sample is measured as an external magnetic field, $H$, is slowly increased from zero. The following behavior is observed:\n\n1.  For applied fields from $H = 0$ up to a value $H_{c1}$, the magnetization is found to be strictly linear with the applied field, following the relation $M = -H$.\n2.  When the applied field is increased beyond $H_{c1}$, the magnitude of the negative magnetization begins to decrease, moving from its value at $H_{c1}$ progressively towards zero.\n3.  At a second, higher field value $H_{c2}$, the magnetization becomes effectively zero and remains so for all $H > H_{c2}$.\n\nBased on these experimental observations, how should this material be classified?\n\nA.

A hard ferromagnet", "solution": "We interpret the magnetization data using the constitutive relation in SI units, $B=\\mu_{0}(H+M)$. In a superconductor exhibiting the Meissner effect, magnetic induction is expelled from the bulk so that $B=0$ for sufficiently small applied fields, which implies $H+M=0$ and hence $M=-H$. This is a perfect diamagnetic response with susceptibility $\\chi=-1$.\n\nObservation 1 states that for $0 \\leq H \\leq H_{c1}$, the material shows $M=-H$, i.e., full Meissner expulsion, consistent with superconductivity. Observation 2 states that for $H>H_{c1}$ the magnitude of the negative magnetization decreases continuously toward zero as $H$ increases. This behavior indicates partial flux penetration: the induction $B$ becomes nonzero while superconductivity persists in parts of the sample. This is the mixed (Shubnikov) state characteristic of Type II superconductors, which occurs between a lower critical field $H_{c1}$ and an upper critical field $H_{c2}$. Observation 3 states that at $H_{c2}$ the magnetization becomes effectively zero for all $H>H_{c2}$, indicating that superconductivity is destroyed and the material is in its normal state with negligible magnetization (for a nonmagnetic metal), consistent with the definition of $H_{c2}$ for Type II superconductors.\n\nBy contrast, a Type I superconductor has a single critical field $H_{c}$; for $H<H_{c}$ it exhibits $M=-H$ (Meissner state), and at $H=H_{c}$ it transitions abruptly to the normal state with $M\\approx 0$, without an extended field range of gradual reduction in $|M|$. Therefore Observation 2 rules out Type I behavior. The remaining options are also inconsistent: a perfect diamagnet at all fields would retain $M=-H$ for all $H$, which is contradicted by the vanishing $M$ for $H>H_{c2}$; a soft paramagnet would have small positive $M$ proportional to $H$ rather than negative $M$; and a hard ferromagnet would display hysteresis and remanent magnetization, not the reversible superconducting features described.\n\nThus, the presence of two critical fields $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ with a mixed state in between uniquely identifies a Type II superconductor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1338548"}, {"introduction": "Why does a material become superconducting at all?
