This first exercise explores one of the most fundamental examples: a pH-responsive hydrogel. This practice [@problem_id:1334285] will challenge you to apply your knowledge of acid-base chemistry to predict how a polymer network swells or shrinks, a critical principle behind designing \"smart\" oral drug delivery systems that can navigate the digestive tract.", "problem": "A materials chemist is designing a novel hydrogel for targeted oral drug delivery. The ultimate goal is to encapsulate a drug, protect it from the harsh environment of the stomach, and then release it in the small intestine. The hydrogel is synthesized from a cross-linked polymer network that contains a high density of amine functional groups (-NH2), which are chemically basic.\n\nThe hydrogel, loaded with a therapeutic agent, is formed into a capsule for ingestion. The capsule first passes through the stomach, where the environment is highly acidic with a pH of approximately 2.0. Subsequently, it travels to the upper small intestine, where the environment is approximately neutral with a pH of about 7.0.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of polymer chemistry and acid-base interactions, predict the change in the state of the hydrogel as it transitions from the stomach to the small intestine, and identify the primary physicochemical reason for this change.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes this process?\n\nA. The hydrogel will swell, because the amine groups become deprotonated, which increases their ability to form hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules.\n\nB. The hydrogel will shrink, because the amine groups become deprotonated, which reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the polymer chains.\n\nC. The hydrogel will swell, because the amine groups become protonated, which increases the electrostatic repulsion between the polymer chains.\n\nD. The hydrogel will shrink, because the amine groups become protonated, which neutralizes the polymer backbone and promotes aggregation.\n\nE. The hydrogel's volume will not change significantly, as its structure is primarily determined by the fixed density of cross-links in the polymer network.", "solution": "We analyze the acid-base behavior of amine groups on the hydrogel and its consequence for polyelectrolyte swelling.\n\n1) Acid-base equilibrium of amines:\nPrimary amines are basic, and in aqueous solution they undergo protonation according to\n$$\\text{R-NH}_{2} + \\text{H}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{R-NH}_{3}^{+}.$$\nLet $\\text{B} \\equiv \\text{R-NH}_{2}$ and $\\text{BH}^{+} \\equiv \\text{R-NH}_{3}^{+}$. The Hendersonâ€“Hasselbalch relation for the conjugate acid $\\text{BH}^{+}$ is\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\text{B}]}{[\\text{BH}^{+}]}\\right).$$\nDefine the degree of protonation (fraction of charged sites) as\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{[\\text{BH}^{+}]}{[\\text{B}] + [\\text{BH}^{+}]} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}.$$\nThus, when $\\mathrm{pH} \\ll \\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ (highly acidic stomach), $\\alpha \\approx 1$ and the amines are predominantly protonated (positively charged). When $\\mathrm{pH}$ increases toward or above $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ (near-neutral small intestine), $\\alpha$ decreases and the amines become deprotonated (neutral).\n\n2) Consequences for hydrogel swelling:\nA hydrogel bearing fixed charges behaves as a polyelectrolyte network. The swelling pressure has a significant ionic (Donnan) contribution due to the imbalance of mobile counterions between the gel and the surrounding solution. A standard form for the ionic contribution is\n$$\\Pi_{\\text{ion}} \\approx k_{B}T\\left(c_{\\text{in}} - c_{\\text{out}}\\right),$$\nwhere $c_{\\text{in}}$ depends on the fixed charge density $C_{f}$ in the gel. Since $C_{f} \\propto \\alpha$, one has that $\\Pi_{\\text{ion}}$ increases with $\\alpha$. Additionally, like-charge electrostatic repulsions along the polymer backbone increase chain expansion. Both effects increase swelling when the amines are protonated.\n\n3) Predicted change from stomach to small intestine:\n- In the stomach ($\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 2.0$), $\\alpha$ is high; the polymer carries many $\\text{R-NH}_{3}^{+}$ groups, leading to strong electrostatic repulsion and a large Donnan osmotic pressure, so the hydrogel is swollen.\n- In the small intestine ($\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 7.0$), $\\alpha$ decreases; the amines deprotonate to neutral $\\text{R-NH}_{2}$, reducing the fixed charge density, decreasing both electrostatic repulsion and the ionic swelling pressure. The hydrogel correspondingly deswells or shrinks.\n\nTherefore, as the hydrogel transitions from the stomach to the small intestine, it shrinks because the amine groups become deprotonated, reducing electrostatic repulsion between polymer chains. This matches option B. Options A and C misattribute swelling to deprotonation (incorrect) or to the wrong pH transition, D incorrectly claims protonation neutralizes the backbone, and E ignores the dominant role of charge-dependent swelling in polyelectrolyte hydrogels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1334285"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative predictions to quantitative design, this next practice focuses on temperature-responsive polymers, which are vital in fields like bioseparation and tissue engineering.

The separation strategy involves binding Hemobindin to the soluble polymer at a low temperature, then raising the temperature to precipitate the polymer-protein complex, thus separating it from other contaminants in an aqueous broth.\n\nThe phase transition is governed by the thermodynamics of polymer solvation. The LCST is the temperature at which the Gibbs free energy of solution ($\\Delta G_{sol}$) is zero.
