A simplified model of such a sensor consists of a small, solid cylinder of a piezoelectric ceramic, such as Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT). This cylinder has electrodes on its flat top and bottom faces.\n\nThe cylinder is oriented with its axis along the z-direction. It is \"poled\" during manufacturing, meaning it possesses a permanent spontaneous electrical polarization, $\\vec{P}_S$, which is uniform and directed along the positive z-axis (from the bottom face to the top face). The key material property for this application is the piezoelectric charge coefficient $d_{33}$, which relates an applied mechanical stress along the z-axis ($\\sigma_{33}$) to the change in electrical polarization along the z-axis ($\\Delta P_3$). For the PZT material used, the coefficient $d_{33}$ is known to be positive.\n\nDuring an engine knock, the cylinder experiences a sudden, brief uniaxial compressive stress along its axis. This means the top and bottom faces are pushed towards each other. An external circuit measures the resulting potential difference, defined as $V = V_{\\text{top}} - V_{\\text{bottom}}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the sign of the voltage $V$ generated across the cylinder during this compression event?\n\nA. $V$ becomes positive.\n\nB. $V$ becomes negative.\n\nC. $V$ remains zero because the forces are equal and opposite.\n\nD. The sign of $V$ depends on the magnitude of the compressive force.\n\nE. The sign of $V$ cannot be determined without knowing the pyroelectric coefficient.", "solution": "The direct piezoelectric effect is described by the constitutive relation that links electric displacement ($D_3$) to mechanical stress ($T_3$) and electric field ($E_3$):\n$$ D_3 = d_{33} T_3 + \\epsilon_{33}^T E_3 $$\nHere, $d_{33}$ is the piezoelectric charge coefficient and $\\epsilon_{33}^T$ is the permittivity at constant stress.\n\nThe problem states the following conditions:\n1.  The sensor is measured by a high-impedance circuit, which approximates an open-circuit condition. Under open-circuit, no free charge flows, so the electric displacement $D_3$ (which equals the free surface charge density) is zero.\n2.  The cylinder experiences a compressive stress. By standard convention in mechanics, compressive stress is negative, so $T_3  0$.\n3.  The material (PZT) has a positive piezoelectric coefficient, $d_{33} > 0$.\n\nSetting $D_3 = 0$ in the constitutive equation, we can solve for the induced electric field:\n$$ 0 = d_{33} T_3 + \\epsilon_{33}^T E_3 \\implies E_3 = -\\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^T} T_3 $$\nSince $d_{33} > 0$, $\\epsilon_{33}^T > 0$, and $T_3  0$, the resulting electric field is positive: $E_3 > 0$. This means the induced electric field vector points in the positive $z$-direction (from the bottom electrode to the top electrode).\n\nThe electric field points from a region of higher potential to a region of lower potential. Since the field points from bottom to top, the bottom electrode is at a higher potential than the top electrode.\nThe measured voltage is defined as $V = V_{\\text{top}} - V_{\\text{bottom}}$. Since $V_{\\text{top}}  V_{\\text{bottom}}$, the voltage $V$ must be negative.\n\nAlternatively, using the integral definition of potential difference for a uniform field $E_3$ over a thickness $t$:\n$$ V = V_{\\text{top}} - V_{\\text{bottom}} = - \\int_{\\text{bottom}}^{\\text{top}} E_3 \\, dz = -E_3 t $$\nSince we found $E_3 > 0$ and the thickness $t$ is positive, the voltage $V$ is negative.\nTherefore, the compression event causes the top electrode to become negative relative to the bottom electrode.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1299583"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, this exercise moves into the practical realm of materials selection for a high-sensitivity pressure sensor [@problem_id:1299629]. You will discover that simply choosing a material with the highest piezoelectric charge coefficient ($d_{33}$) may not lead to the best sensor performance. This problem illustrates the crucial interplay between generated charge and the material's capacitance, introducing the piezoelectric voltage coefficient ($g_{33}$) as a more relevant figure of merit for high-impedance voltage-sensing applications.", "problem": "An engineer is designing a highly sensitive dynamic pressure sensor. The core of the sensor is a small disc of a piezoelectric ceramic. The sensor operates by converting a small, rapidly changing force, applied perpendicular to the disc's flat faces, into a measurable voltage signal. The electronics connected to the sensor have a very high input impedance, meaning the sensor operates under near open-circuit conditions where minimal charge is drawn. The primary design goal is to maximize the output voltage for a given applied pressure (stress).\n\nTwo candidate materials, Material Alpha and Material Beta, are being considered. Their relevant material properties for the longitudinal piezoelectric effect (along the '3' axis, perpendicular to the faces) are provided below. The longitudinal piezoelectric charge coefficient, $d_{33}$, relates the induced electric polarization to the applied mechanical stress. The relative permittivity, $\\epsilon_r$, is the dielectric constant of the material relative to the vacuum permittivity.\n\n- **Material Alpha:** $d_{33} = 550 \\times 10^{-12}$ C/N, $\\epsilon_r = 2100$\n- **Material Beta:** $d_{33} = 180 \\times 10^{-12}$ C/N, $\\epsilon_r = 120$\n\nWhich material is the better choice for this specific application, and what is the correct physical reasoning behind this choice?\n\nA. Material Alpha should be chosen, as its significantly higher charge coefficient ($d_{33}$) means it generates more separated charge per unit of applied force, which directly results in a higher voltage.\n\nB. Material Beta should be chosen, because its much lower relative permittivity ($\\epsilon_r$) leads to a higher piezoelectric voltage coefficient ($g_{33}$), even though its charge coefficient ($d_{33}$) is lower.\n\nC. Material Alpha should be chosen, because its high relative permittivity ($\\epsilon_r$) allows the sensor to store more electrical energy, leading to a more powerful voltage signal.\n\nD. Material Beta should be chosen, because a lower charge coefficient ($d_{33}$) inherently corresponds to greater voltage sensitivity in all piezoelectric materials.\n\nE. Both materials are equally suitable because the final voltage output depends only on the sensor's thickness and the applied stress, not on the specific values of $d_{33}$ or $\\epsilon_r$.", "solution": "The linear piezoelectric constitutive relations (contracted notation) for the longitudinal 3-direction are\n$$\nD_{3} = d_{33}\\,T_{3} + \\epsilon_{33}^{T}\\,E_{3},\n$$\nwhere $D_{3}$ is electric displacement, $T_{3}$ is mechanical stress, $E_{3}$ is electric field, $d_{33}$ is the charge coefficient, and $\\epsilon_{33}^{T}$ is the permittivity at constant stress. For a homogeneous plate polarized and stressed along the 3-axis and operated under open-circuit conditions, the electrodes are isolated so that no free charge can flow. The free charge on the electrodes is therefore zero, which implies that the average normal electric displacement equals the free charge density, hence\n$$\nD_{3} = 0 \\quad \\text{(open circuit)}.\n$$\nImposing $D_{3}=0$ in the constitutive relation gives\n$$\n0 = d_{33}\\,T_{3} + \\epsilon_{33}^{T}\\,E_{3}\n\\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\;\nE_{3} = -\\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{T}}\\,T_{3}.\n$$\nDefining the piezoelectric voltage coefficient\n$$\ng_{33} \\equiv \\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{T}},\n$$\nthe open-circuit field is $E_{3} = -g_{33}\\,T_{3}$. For a plate of thickness $t$, the open-circuit voltage is\n$$\nV_{\\text{oc}} = -E_{3}\\,t = g_{33}\\,T_{3}\\,t.\n$$\nThus, for a given applied stress (pressure) and fixed thickness, the voltage sensitivity is proportional to $g_{33}$, not directly to $d_{33}$. Using $\\epsilon_{33}^{T} = \\epsilon_{0}\\,\\epsilon_{r}$, this becomes\n$$\ng_{33} = \\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{0}\\,\\epsilon_{r}} \\propto \\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{r}}.\n$$\nTherefore, to maximize the open-circuit voltage for a given stress, one must maximize $d_{33}/\\epsilon_{r}$. Comparing the two candidates, Material Beta has a much smaller $\\epsilon_{r}$ while its $d_{33}$ is only moderately smaller; consequently, the ratio $d_{33}/\\epsilon_{r}$ (and hence $g_{33}$) is larger for Material Beta than for Material Alpha.

Its operation relies on the converse piezoelectric effect: an applied electric field $E$ induces a mechanical strain $S$ in a non-centrosymmetric crystal, which can be written in linear form using matrix notation as $S_p = s_{pq}^E T_q + d_{kp} E_k$, where $T$ is stress, $s^{E}$ is the elastic compliance at constant $E$, and $d$ is the piezoelectric tensor. Under an alternating $E$, the crystal undergoes driven mechanical vibration and, at its mechanical resonance, exhibits a highly stable oscillation suitable for timing. The necessary material property is piezoelectricity, which requires lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal. Quartz ($\\text{SiO}_2$) satisfies this: it is piezoelectric and non-centrosymmetric, providing stable resonance, but it does not possess spontaneous polarization.\n\nComponent B is a non-volatile ferroelectric memory cell.
