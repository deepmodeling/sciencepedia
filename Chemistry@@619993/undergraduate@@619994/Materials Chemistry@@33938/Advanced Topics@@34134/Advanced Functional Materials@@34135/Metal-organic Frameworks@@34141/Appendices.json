This principle allows chemists to act as molecular architects, precisely tuning the properties of a material by systematically changing its building blocks. This first exercise provides a hands-on look at this design principle by exploring how changing the length of an organic linker directly impacts the pore dimensions of a MOF, a fundamental skill in designing materials for specific applications like molecular separations. [@problem_id:2270798]", "problem": "A materials chemist is designing a series of hypothetical two-dimensional (2D) Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). These materials are constructed from metal-containing nodes, known as Secondary Building Units (SBUs), which are connected by linear organic linkers. The resulting structure is a regular square grid, where each SBU acts as a corner and each linker forms one of the sides of a square-shaped pore. For the purpose of this problem, you can model the SBUs as dimensionless points and the linkers as ideal one-dimensional lines that define the geometry of the pores.\n\nThe initial framework, designated MOF-1, is synthesized using a linker of length $L_1 = 14.4$ Å. Subsequently, a second framework, MOF-2, is created by substituting the original linker with a shorter one of length $L_2 = 8.6$ Å.\n\nCalculate the resulting decrease in the cross-sectional area of a single pore when the framework is changed from MOF-1 to MOF-2.

The problem states that the MOF has a 2D square-grid structure. The Secondary Building Units (SBUs) are at the corners, and the linear linkers form the sides of the square pores. The SBUs are modeled as dimensionless points. Therefore, the side length of a square pore is exactly equal to the length of the linker used to construct it.\n\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of its side.\n\nFor the initial framework, MOF-1, the linker has a length of $L_1 = 14.4$ Å. The side length of the pore, $s_1$, is equal to $L_1$. The area of a pore in MOF-1, denoted as $A_1$, is:\n$$A_1 = s_1^2 = L_1^2$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $L_1$:\n$$A_1 = (14.4 \\, \\text{Å})^2 = 207.36 \\, \\text{Å}^2$$\n\nFor the second framework, MOF-2, the linker has a length of $L_2 = 8.6$ Å. The side length of the pore, $s_2$, is equal to $L_2$. The area of a pore in MOF-2, denoted as $A_2$, is:\n$$A_2 = s_2^2 = L_2^2$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $L_2$:\n$$A_2 = (8.6 \\, \\text{Å})^2 = 73.96 \\, \\text{Å}^2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the decrease in the cross-sectional area of the pore when transitioning from MOF-1 to MOF-2. This decrease, $\\Delta A$, is the difference between the initial area and the final area.\n$$\\Delta A = A_1 - A_2$$\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated areas:\n$$\\Delta A = 207.36 \\, \\text{Å}^2 - 73.96 \\, \\text{Å}^2 = 133.4 \\, \\text{Å}^2$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $133.4$. The first three significant figures are 1, 3, and 3. The fourth digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the last significant digit).\n\nTherefore, the decrease in pore area is $133 \\, \\text{Å}^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{133}$$", "id": "2270798"}, {"introduction": "After synthesizing a MOF, its pores are typically occupied by solvent molecules that must be removed to \"activate\" the material for use.
