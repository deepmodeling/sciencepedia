By comparing a linear alkane with its bulkier branched isomer, you will apply the core principle of molecular sieving to predict which molecule is able to enter the catalyst's pores and undergo reaction.", "problem": "In the chemical industry, zeolites are widely used as solid-acid catalysts due to their unique, porous crystalline structures which can exhibit shape-selectivity. Consider a catalytic process designed to exclusively convert one isomer from a mixed feedstock. A gaseous stream containing an equimolar mixture of linear n-pentane and branched neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane) is passed over a bed of a specific zeolite catalyst at an elevated temperature.\n\nThe zeolite possesses a network of straight, non-intersecting cylindrical pores, and its catalytic active sites are located exclusively on the inner walls of these pores. The effective diameter of these pores is given as $d_{\\text{pore}} = 0.58 \\text{ nm}$.\n\nFor the purpose of diffusion into these pores, n-pentane can be modeled as a rod with a critical kinetic diameter of $d_{\\text{n-pentane}} = 0.43 \\text{ nm}$. The more spherical neopentane molecule has a larger critical kinetic diameter of $d_{\\text{neopentane}} = 0.62 \\text{ nm}$.\n\nBased on this information and the principle of shape-selective catalysis, which of the following statements most accurately describes the outcome of this process?\n\nA. Neopentane will exhibit a higher conversion rate because its highly symmetric structure allows for more stable binding to the active sites.\n\nB. n-Pentane will exhibit a higher conversion rate because its linear structure allows it to diffuse into the zeolite pores and access the active sites.\n\nC. Neopentane will exhibit a higher conversion rate because the quaternary carbon atom makes the molecule inherently more reactive in catalytic cracking.\n\nD. Both isomers will have nearly identical conversion rates, as they have the same molecular formula and mass, and thus similar overall reactivity.\n\nE. n-Pentane will exhibit a higher conversion rate because linear alkanes are thermodynamically less stable than their branched isomers.", "solution": "Shape-selective catalysis in zeolites with internal active sites requires that reactant molecules diffuse into the pores to reach the catalytic sites. The necessary geometric criterion for access is that the molecular kinetic (critical) diameter does not exceed the effective pore diameter:\n$$\nd_{\\text{molecule}} \\leq d_{\\text{pore}}.\n$$\nThe problem specifies a zeolite with straight, non-intersecting cylindrical pores of effective diameter $d_{\\text{pore}} = 0.58 \\text{ nm}$ and two molecules characterized by their kinetic diameters: $d_{\\text{n-pentane}} = 0.43 \\text{ nm}$ and $d_{\\text{neopentane}} = 0.62 \\text{ nm}$.

You will analyze how a simple ion-exchange procedure can fundamentally alter the catalyst's functionality, effectively 'switching off' its activity by removing the necessary acidic protons ($H^{+}$).", "problem": "In the petrochemical industry, zeolites are widely used as catalysts for the isomerization of xylenes. A common goal is to convert a mixture of xylenes into the more valuable para-xylene (*p*-xylene), which is a precursor for producing polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The catalyst often employed is an H-zeolite, a synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate. The zeolite's framework is composed of corner-sharing $\\text{SiO}_4$ and $\\text{AlO}_4$ tetrahedra. The substitution of a silicon(IV) ion with an aluminum(III) ion creates a net negative charge on the framework, which is balanced by a mobile proton ($\\text{H}^+$). These protons act as Brønsted-Lowry acid sites and are essential for the catalytic isomerization process.\n\nA chemical engineer is preparing a batch of this H-zeolite catalyst. However, due to a procedural error, the prepared zeolite is unintentionally washed with a concentrated solution of sodium chloride (NaCl), leading to a near-complete ion exchange where the protons ($\\text{H}^+$) are replaced by sodium ions ($\\text{Na}^+$). The engineer decides to test this modified Na-zeolite in the xylene isomerization reactor under the same temperature and pressure conditions as the standard H-zeolite process.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most probable result of using this Na-exchanged zeolite for the acid-catalyzed isomerization of xylenes?\n\nA. The reaction rate will significantly increase because the larger $\\text{Na}^+$ ions create steric hindrance that specifically favors the transition state for *p*-xylene formation.\n\nB. The reaction selectivity will shift, favoring the formation of ortho-xylene (*o*-xylene) instead of *p*-xylene, while the overall reaction rate remains unchanged.\n\nC. The catalytic activity for xylene isomerization will be drastically reduced or eliminated, as the necessary acid sites for the reaction mechanism are no longer present.\n\nD. The catalytic mechanism will switch from Brønsted acid catalysis to Lewis acid catalysis, leading to a moderate increase in the overall reaction rate.", "solution": "1) Zeolite framework charge balance and acid sites: Substitution of a framework $\\mathrm{Si}^{4+}$ by $\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$ creates a negative framework charge localized on an $\\mathrm{AlO}_{4}$ tetrahedron. In the H-form, this charge is balanced by a proton associated with a bridging hydroxyl, commonly denoted as a Brønsted acid site $\\equiv \\mathrm{Si}-\\mathrm{OH}-\\mathrm{Al} \\equiv$. These $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ sites provide Brønsted acidity.\n\n2) Effect of Na-exchange on acid sites: Ion exchange with $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ replaces $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ with $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ at the charge-compensating positions, yielding $\\equiv \\mathrm{Si}-\\mathrm{O}^{-}-\\mathrm{Al} \\equiv \\cdot \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and removing the mobile proton. Consequently, the number of Brønsted acid sites, denoted $n_{\\mathrm{BA}}$, drops to near zero.\n\n3) Mechanistic requirement for xylene isomerization: Acid-catalyzed xylene isomerization on H-zeolites proceeds via Brønsted protonation of the aromatic ring to form an arenium ion intermediate, followed by rearrangement and deprotonation. Symbolically, the key initiation step is\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ar} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{ArH}^{+},\n$$\nwhich requires Brønsted acidity. Without $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, this pathway is not accessible.\n\n4) Consequence for reaction rate: The turnover rate for this Brønsted-acid-catalyzed reaction scales with the density of Brønsted acid sites, which can be written schematically as\n$$\nr \\propto n_{\\mathrm{BA}}\\, k(T)\\, \\phi(C),\n$$\nwhere $k(T)$ is a temperature-dependent intrinsic rate constant and $\\phi(C)$ captures concentration effects. After near-complete Na exchange, $n_{\\mathrm{BA}} \\rightarrow 0$, thus\n$$\nr \\rightarrow 0.\n$$\n\n5) Evaluation of the options:\n- A is incorrect because introducing $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ removes Brønsted acidity and often introduces pore blocking; there is no mechanistic basis for a rate increase via steric favoring of the transition state, and in practice the rate decreases sharply.\n- B is incorrect because the overall rate cannot remain unchanged when the essential Brønsted sites are removed; isomerization activity collapses rather than showing an isolated selectivity shift.\n- C is correct: removing $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ eliminates the Brønsted acid sites required for the arenium-ion mechanism, drastically reducing or eliminating catalytic activity.\n- D is incorrect because $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ is a poor Lewis acid and does not confer an alternative effective Lewis acid mechanism for aromatic isomerization; no rate increase is expected.\n\nTherefore, the most probable outcome is a drastic reduction or elimination of catalytic activity for xylene isomerization upon Na exchange.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1347912"}, {"introduction": "Shape selectivity can manifest in complex ways, often overriding the intrinsic chemical kinetics of a reaction to favor products that can more easily navigate the catalyst's pore network.
