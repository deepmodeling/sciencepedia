The Seebeck coefficient, $S$, is a measure of the magnitude of this induced voltage in response to a temperature difference. It is defined by the relation:\n$$S = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta T}$$\nwhere $\\Delta V$ is the induced voltage difference and $\\Delta T$ is the temperature difference across the material. The sign convention used in the problem is $\\Delta V = V_{cold} - V_{hot}$ and $\\Delta T = T_{hot} - T_{cold}$, which for a p-type material (positive charge carriers) yields a positive Seebeck coefficient.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe potential difference, $\\Delta V = +3.50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nThe temperature difference, $\\Delta T = 12.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe question requires the final answer to be in units of microvolts per Kelvin ($\\mu\\mathrm{V/K}$).
