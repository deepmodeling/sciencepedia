On subsequent cooling without external load, the material transforms to twinned Martensite without re-developing the prior macroscopic deformation (no two-way effect).\n- Strain decomposition: The macroscopic strain can be written as\n$$\n\\epsilon=\\epsilon^{el}+\\epsilon^{tr},\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon^{el}$ is the elastic strain and $\\epsilon^{tr}$ is the transformation (detwinning) strain.

Hence the phase is fully Austenite. With no external force, $\\epsilon^{el}=0$ and Austenite carries no transformation strain, so the total strain is $\\epsilon=0$. Therefore, P1: (Austenite, Strain $=0$).\n\n2) Cool to $T_2  M_f$, then bend at $T_2$ to induce macroscopic deformation $\\epsilon_L$. At $T_2  M_f$, the phase is Martensite. The applied bending detwins Martensite and produces $\\epsilon^{tr}=\\epsilon_L$; after unloading at this temperature, the detwinned Martensite retains the transformation strain, so $\\epsilon=\\epsilon_L$. Therefore, P2: (Martensite, Strain $=\\epsilon_L$).\n\n3) Heat without external forces to $T_1 > A_f$. On heating through $A_s$ to $A_f$, the detwinned Martensite transforms to Austenite, recovering the parent shape due to the one-way shape memory effect. Under zero load, $\\epsilon^{el}=0$ and Austenite has $\\epsilon^{tr}=0$, so the macroscopic strain returns to $\\epsilon=0$. Therefore, P3: (Austenite, Strain $=0$).\n\n4) Cool again without external forces to $T_2  M_f$. On cooling without load, Austenite transforms to twinned Martensite. In a one-way SMA, there is no spontaneous macroscopic shape change on cooling in the absence of load; the resulting twinned Martensite has $\\epsilon^{tr}=0$, and with no external load $\\epsilon^{el}=0$, so $\\epsilon=0$.
