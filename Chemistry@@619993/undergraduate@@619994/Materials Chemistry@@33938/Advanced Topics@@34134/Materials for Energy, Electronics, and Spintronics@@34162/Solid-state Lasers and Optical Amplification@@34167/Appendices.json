The active ions in the crystal host are modeled using a simplified three-level energy system comprising a ground state ($E_0$), a metastable upper lasing level ($E_1$), and a pump level ($E_2$). The laser operates through the following sequence: an external pump source excites electrons from the ground state to the pump level. The electrons then rapidly decay non-radiatively from the pump level to the metastable level, releasing energy in the form of phonons (lattice vibrations).
