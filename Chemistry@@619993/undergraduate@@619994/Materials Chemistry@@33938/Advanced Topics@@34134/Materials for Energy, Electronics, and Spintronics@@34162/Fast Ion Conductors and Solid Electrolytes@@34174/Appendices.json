To characterize their performance, the ionic conductivity ($\\sigma$) of each material is measured over a range of temperatures. The behavior of ionic conductivity as a function of absolute temperature ($T$) is well-described by the Arrhenius-type equation:\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\sigma_0$ is the pre-exponential factor (related to carrier concentration and mobility), $E_a$ is the activation energy for ion conduction, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nWhen the experimental data is plotted, with the natural logarithm of conductivity ($\\ln(\\sigma)$) on the y-axis and the reciprocal of absolute temperature ($1/T$) on the x-axis, both materials yield a straight line.

It is impossible to compare the activation energies without knowing the value of the pre-exponential factor ($\\sigma_0$).", "solution": "The problem asks us to interpret the physical meaning of the slope in an Arrhenius plot for ionic conductivity. The governing equation is given as:\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the ionic conductivity, $\\sigma_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nTo analyze the relationship in the form of a straight line, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln(\\sigma) = \\ln\\left(\\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$, we can separate the terms:\n$$ \\ln(\\sigma) = \\ln(\\sigma_0) + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) $$\nSince the natural logarithm and the exponential function are inverses, $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$. Applying this, we get:\n$$ \\ln(\\sigma) = \\ln(\\sigma_0) - \\frac{E_a}{k_B T} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to match the standard form of a linear equation, $y = mx + c$, where $y$ is the vertical axis, $x$ is the horizontal axis, $m$ is the slope, and $c$ is the y-intercept.\n\nThe problem states that the data is presented on an Arrhenius plot where the y-axis is $\\ln(\\sigma)$ and the x-axis is $1/T$. Let's identify the corresponding parts of our equation:\n- $y = \\ln(\\sigma)$\n- $x = \\frac{1}{T}$\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\ln(\\sigma_0)$\n- The slope is $m = -\\frac{E_a}{k_B}$\n\nFrom the relationship for the slope, we can express the activation energy, $E_a$, in terms of the slope, $m$:\n$$ E_a = -m \\cdot k_B $$\nSince the activation energy $E_a$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ are both positive quantities, the slope $m$ must be negative, which is consistent with the experimental observation.\n\nThe key insight comes from this relationship. For a larger activation energy $E_a$, the value of $-m \\cdot k_B$ must be larger. Since $k_B$ is a constant, this means the magnitude of the slope, $|m|$, must be larger. A larger magnitude for a negative slope means the slope is \"more negative\" or \"steeper\" in the downward direction.\n\nThe problem states that the line for Material A is steeper (has a more negative slope) than the line for Material B. Let $m_A$ be the slope for Material A and $m_B$ be the slope for Material B. The condition \"steeper\" or \"more negative\" translates to:\n$$ m_A < m_B $$\n(For example, a slope of -10 is more negative than a slope of -5). This also means the magnitudes are related as:\n$$ |m_A| > |m_B| $$\nUsing our derived equation for activation energy, $E_a = -m \\cdot k_B$:\nFor Material A: $E_{a,A} = -m_A \\cdot k_B$\nFor Material B: $E_{a,B} = -m_B \\cdot k_B$\n\nSince $m_A < m_B$ and we are multiplying by a negative constant ($-k_B$), the inequality reverses:\n$$ -m_A \\cdot k_B > -m_B \\cdot k_B $$\n$$ E_{a,A} > E_{a,B} $$\nTherefore, Material A has a higher activation energy for ion conduction than Material B. This corresponds to option A.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n- B: This is the opposite of our conclusion.\n- C & D: The slope is related only to the activation energy ($E_a$) and the Boltzmann constant ($k_B$). The pre-exponential factor ($\\sigma_0$) and related properties like ion concentration determine the y-intercept, $\\ln(\\sigma_0)$, not the slope. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions about $\\sigma_0$ from the slope alone.\n- E: This is incorrect.

These are filamentary growths of metallic lithium that can penetrate the solid electrolyte separator, creating an internal short circuit that leads to catastrophic cell failure.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this process in a solid-state battery cell operating at a constant temperature. During charging, a single, cylindrical lithium dendrite with a constant radius $r$ begins to grow from the flat lithium metal anode, extending perpendicularly through a solid electrolyte of thickness $L$. The cell is being charged with a constant, uniform current density of $J$ across the entire electrode surface.\n\nA materials science analysis suggests that due to local inhomogeneities, a fraction $\\eta$ of the total electrical current passing through the circular area defined by the dendrite's base is channeled into the growth of the dendrite itself.

The dendrite is modeled as a cylinder with radius $r$, so the area of its base is $A_{\\text{dendrite}} = \\pi r^2$. The total current flowing through this area of the electrode is the product of the current density $J$ and this area: $I_{\\text{local}} = J \\times A_{\\text{dendrite}} = J \\pi r^2$.\nThe problem states that only a fraction $\\eta$ of this local current contributes to the dendrite's growth. Therefore, the growth current is:\n$$I_{\\text{growth}} = \\eta I_{\\text{local}} = \\eta J \\pi r^2$$\n\nNext, we use Faraday's law of electrolysis to relate this current to the rate of deposition of lithium. Faraday's law states that the number of moles, $n$, of a substance deposited is proportional to the total charge passed. The rate form of this law is:\n$$\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\frac{I}{zF}$$\nwhere $\\frac{dn}{dt}$ is the molar deposition rate, $I$ is the current, $z$ is the number of electrons transferred per ion, and $F$ is Faraday's constant.
