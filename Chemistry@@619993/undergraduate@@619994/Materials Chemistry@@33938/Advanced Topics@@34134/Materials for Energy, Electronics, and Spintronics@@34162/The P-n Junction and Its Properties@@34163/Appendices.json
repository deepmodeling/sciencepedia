The first step is to create a simple device, an abrupt p-n junction, to characterize its fundamental electronic properties. The p-side of the junction is created by uniformly doping the material with an acceptor concentration of $N_A$, and the n-side with a uniform donor concentration of $N_D$. Assume that all dopant atoms are fully ionized. The junction is maintained at a constant absolute temperature $T$. The intrinsic carrier concentration for this specific semiconductor at temperature $T$ is given by $n_i$.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for the built-in potential, $V_{bi}$, across the junction at thermal equilibrium. The final expression should be in terms of the given parameters $N_A$, $N_D$, $n_i$, $T$, and the fundamental constants $k_B$ (Boltzmann constant) and $q$ (elementary charge).", "solution": "The built-in potential, $V_{bi}$, arises from the formation of a depletion region at the interface of the p-type and n-type materials. At thermal equilibrium, there is no net flow of charge carriers across the junction. This means that for each type of carrier (electrons and holes), the drift current caused by the electric field in the depletion region must exactly balance the diffusion current caused by the concentration gradient.\n\nLet's consider the holes. The hole diffusion current density, $J_{p, \\text{diff}}$, is driven by the concentration gradient and is given by Fick's first law:\n$$J_{p, \\text{diff}} = -q D_p \\frac{dp}{dx}$$\nwhere $D_p$ is the diffusion coefficient for holes, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $p(x)$ is the hole concentration as a function of position $x$ across the junction.\n\nThe hole drift current density, $J_{p, \\text{drift}}$, is driven by the electric field $E(x)$ in the depletion region:\n$$J_{p, \\text{drift}} = q p \\mu_p E$$\nwhere $\\mu_p$ is the hole mobility.\n\nAt thermal equilibrium, the net hole current density is zero: $J_p = J_{p, \\text{drift}} + J_{p, \\text{diff}} = 0$.\n$$q p \\mu_p E - q D_p \\frac{dp}{dx} = 0$$\nRearranging this equation gives an expression for the electric field:\n$$E = \\frac{D_p}{p \\mu_p} \\frac{dp}{dx}$$\n\nWe can relate the diffusion coefficient and mobility using the Einstein relation:\n$$\\frac{D_p}{\\mu_p} = \\frac{k_B T}{q}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSubstituting the Einstein relation into the expression for the electric field:\n$$E = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\frac{1}{p} \\frac{dp}{dx}$$\n\nThe electric field is also related to the electrostatic potential $V(x)$ by $E = -dV/dx$. Therefore:\n$$-\\frac{dV}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\frac{1}{p} \\frac{dp}{dx}$$\nWe can write this as a differential equation:\n$$-dV = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\frac{dp}{p}$$\n\nTo find the total potential difference across the junction, we integrate this equation from the neutral p-side (far from the junction) to the neutral n-side. Let the potential on the p-side be $V_p$ and on the n-side be $V_n$. The corresponding hole concentrations are $p_p$ and $p_n$.\n$$\\int_{V_p}^{V_n} -dV = \\int_{p_p}^{p_n} \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\frac{dp}{p}$$\n$$-(V_n - V_p) = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) [\\ln(p)]_{p_p}^{p_n}$$\nThe built-in potential is defined as the potential difference $V_{bi} = V_n - V_p$.\n$$-V_{bi} = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) (\\ln(p_n) - \\ln(p_p))$$\n$$V_{bi} = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) (\\ln(p_p) - \\ln(p_n)) = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_p}{p_n}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we must relate the hole concentrations $p_p$ and $p_n$ to the given doping concentrations. Assuming full ionization of dopants:\nOn the neutral p-side, the hole concentration is determined by the acceptor doping: $p_p \\approx N_A$.\nOn the neutral n-side, the electron concentration is determined by the donor doping: $n_n \\approx N_D$.\nThe relationship between electron and hole concentrations is governed by the law of mass action: $n \\cdot p = n_i^2$, where $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.\nTherefore, on the n-side, the hole concentration is $p_n = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_n} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $p_p$ and $p_n$ into the equation for $V_{bi}$:\n$$V_{bi} = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i^2 / N_D}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the argument of the logarithm gives the final expression for the built-in potential:\n$$V_{bi} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nThis expression represents the potential barrier that must be overcome for carriers to diffuse across the junction, and it is established by the balance of drift and diffusion currents at thermal equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\\right)}$$", "id": "1341877"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of the built-in potential [@problem_id:1341877], we now shift our focus to the physical dimensions of the junction.
