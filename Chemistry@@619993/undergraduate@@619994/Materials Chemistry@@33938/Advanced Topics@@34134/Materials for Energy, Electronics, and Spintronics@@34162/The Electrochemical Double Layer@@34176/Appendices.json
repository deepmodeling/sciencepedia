The Potential of Zero Charge (PZC) is defined as the electrode potential at which the net charge density on the surface of the metal electrode is exactly zero.\n\nInitially, the PZC of a specific metal electrode is measured in an aqueous solution of sodium fluoride (NaF), yielding a value denoted as $E_{pzc}^{*}$. Fluoride ions ($F^{-}$) are considered non-specifically adsorbing, meaning they do not form direct bonds with the electrode surface and remain solvated, with their plane of closest approach defining the Outer Helmholtz Plane (OHP).\n\nNext, the experiment is repeated using a new solution of sodium iodide (NaI) at the same concentration and temperature.
