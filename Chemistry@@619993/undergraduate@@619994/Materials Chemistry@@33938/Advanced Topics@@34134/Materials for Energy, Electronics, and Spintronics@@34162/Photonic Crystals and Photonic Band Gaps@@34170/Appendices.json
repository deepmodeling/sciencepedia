The DBR is constructed from alternating layers of Material 1, with refractive index $n_1$, and Material 2, with refractive index $n_2$. To achieve maximum reflectivity for light at normal incidence, a specific design rule must be followed: the optical path length within each individual layer must be precisely one-quarter of the target wavelength $\\lambda_0$. The optical path length is defined as the product of the physical thickness of a layer and its refractive index.\n\nAssuming this design rule is perfectly implemented, determine the total physical thickness of a single, fundamental repeating bilayer unit, which consists of one layer of Material 1 adjacent to one layer of Material 2.
