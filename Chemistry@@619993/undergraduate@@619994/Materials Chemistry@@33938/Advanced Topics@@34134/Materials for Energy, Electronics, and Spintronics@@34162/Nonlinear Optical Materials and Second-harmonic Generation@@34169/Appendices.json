A molecule is said to have a center of inversion (i.e., it is centrosymmetric) if there exists a point within the molecule (the inversion center) such that for any atom at position vector $\\vec{r}$ relative to this center, there is an identical atom at position $-\\vec{r}$.

The key principle, as stated in the problem, is that a molecule must be non-centrosymmetric (lack a center of inversion) to have a non-zero $\\beta$. We must therefore analyze the molecular geometry of each option to determine if it possesses a center of inversion.\n\nA center of inversion is a point in space such that if we take every atom in the molecule and reflect it through this central point, the resulting arrangement of atoms is indistinguishable from the original. Let's examine each molecule:\n\nA. Carbon Dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$): This is a linear molecule with the arrangement O-C-O. The carbon atom is located at the geometric center. If we choose the carbon nucleus as the potential center of inversion, the oxygen atom on one side at a position vector $\\vec{r}$ is perfectly mirrored by the other oxygen atom at position $-\\vec{r}$. The carbon atom at the origin is inverted onto itself. Therefore, $\\text{CO}_2$ is centrosymmetric. As a result, its first hyperpolarizability $\\beta$ must be zero.\n\nB. Benzene ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_6$): This molecule has a planar hexagonal ring structure. The geometric center of the ring is a center of inversion. For any carbon atom at position $\\vec{r}$ relative to the center, there is an identical carbon atom at the diametrically opposite position, $-\\vec{r}$. Similarly, each hydrogen atom has a counterpart at the opposite position. Therefore, benzene is centrosymmetric, and its $\\beta$ must be zero.\n\nC. Sulfur Hexafluoride ($\\text{SF}_6$): This molecule has an octahedral geometry, with the sulfur atom at the center and six fluorine atoms at the vertices of the octahedron. The sulfur atom serves as a center of inversion. Each fluorine atom at a position $\\vec{r}$ has an identical fluorine atom at the opposite vertex, position $-\\vec{r}$. Therefore, $\\text{SF}_6$ is centrosymmetric, and its $\\beta$ must be zero.\n\nD. Ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$): This molecule has a trigonal pyramidal geometry. The nitrogen atom is at the apex, and the three hydrogen atoms form the triangular base. There is no point in this molecule that can act as a center of inversion. For example, if we test the nitrogen atom as a potential center, inverting a hydrogen atom at position $\\vec{r}$ through the nitrogen would map it to a point $-\\vec{r}$ where there is no atom. Any other point would also fail the test. Therefore, ammonia is non-centrosymmetric. Because it lacks a center of inversion, it can have a non-zero first hyperpolarizability, $\\beta$.\n\nE. Ethene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4$): This molecule is planar. The two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond, and each carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The midpoint of the C=C bond is a center of inversion. Inverting one carbon atom through this point maps it onto the other carbon atom. Likewise, each of the four hydrogen atoms has a corresponding partner on the opposite side upon inversion through the center. Therefore, ethene is centrosymmetric, and its $\\beta$ must be zero.\n\nBased on this analysis, only ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) is non-centrosymmetric and thus is the only molecule on the list that can possess a non-zero first hyperpolarizability $\\beta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1318835"}, {"introduction": "Even in a non-centrosymmetric material, high conversion efficiency is not guaranteed due to an effect called phase mismatch, where the fundamental and second-harmonic waves fall out of sync.
