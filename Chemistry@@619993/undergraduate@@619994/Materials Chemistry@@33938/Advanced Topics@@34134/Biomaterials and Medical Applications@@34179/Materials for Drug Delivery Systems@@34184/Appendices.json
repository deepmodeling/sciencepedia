The drug is encapsulated in microspheres made from an amorphous polymer, Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), to form a solid dispersion. The goal is for the drug to be molecularly dispersed (i.e., in an amorphous state) within the polymer to enhance its dissolution rate and bioavailability. The final microspheres are prepared with a drug loading of 25.0% by weight.\n\nTo investigate the physical state of the drug within the polymer matrix, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is employed. The following data is obtained from the analysis:\n1.  A sample of pure, 100% crystalline Fenoprofen-X shows a sharp melting endotherm with a specific enthalpy of fusion, $\\Delta H_{f, \\text{drug}}$, of 118.0 J/g.\n2.

A DSC measurement on a sample of the Fenoprofen-X-loaded PLGA microspheres reveals a small, broad endothermic peak corresponding to the melting of the drug. The integrated heat absorbed for this melting event, when normalized by the total mass of the microsphere sample, gives an observed enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{obs}}$, of 11.21 J/g.\n\nThe presence of this melting peak indicates that not all of the drug is amorphously dispersed; a fraction has crystallized within the microspheres. Based on the provided data, calculate the fraction of the total encapsulated Fenoprofen-X that exists in the crystalline state. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fraction of the total encapsulated drug that is in a crystalline state. This can be determined by comparing the observed enthalpy of fusion from the drug-loaded sample to the enthalpy of fusion of the pure, 100% crystalline drug.\n\nLet's define the relevant quantities:\n- $w_{\\text{drug}}$ is the weight fraction of the drug in the microspheres.\n- $\\Delta H_{f, \\text{drug}}$ is the specific enthalpy of fusion for the 100% crystalline drug.\n- $\\Delta H_{\\text{obs}}$ is the observed specific enthalpy of fusion for the drug-loaded microsphere sample, normalized by the total sample mass.\n- $F_{\\text{cryst}}$ is the fraction of the total drug that is in a crystalline state, which is the quantity we need to find.\n\nThe fundamental principle of this analysis is that the measured heat of fusion in a sample is directly proportional to the mass of the crystalline material that is melting.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{sample}}$ be the total mass of the microsphere sample analyzed by DSC.\nThe total mass of the drug within this sample, $m_{\\text{drug, total}}$, is given by the drug loading:\n$m_{\\text{drug, total}} = w_{\\text{drug}} \\times m_{\\text{sample}}$\n\nThe observed enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{obs}}$, is given in units of Joules per gram of the *total sample*.
