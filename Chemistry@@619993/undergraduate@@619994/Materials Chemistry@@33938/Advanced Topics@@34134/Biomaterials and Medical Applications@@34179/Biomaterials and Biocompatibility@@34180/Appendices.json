This initial \"handshake\" is governed by the material's surface properties, which in turn dictate subsequent biological responses like protein adsorption and cell attachment.

A key design goal is to characterize the surface's interaction with aqueous biological fluids. To do this, the researcher places a small droplet of purified water onto a flat sample of the coated material in air and measures the static contact angle using a goniometer. The measured angle, formed by the solid surface and the tangent to the liquid-vapor interface at the point of contact, is found to be $98^\\circ$.\n\nBased on this measurement, which of the following conclusions about the surface is the most scientifically accurate?\n\nA. The surface is hydrophilic, indicating strong adhesive forces between the water and the polymer.\n\nB. The surface is hydrophobic, indicating that the cohesive forces within the water droplet are stronger than the adhesive forces between the water and the polymer.\n\nC. The surface is superhydrophobic, a property typically associated with contact angles greater than 150°.\n\nD.

Furthermore, high solid surface free energy promotes wetting and corresponds to small $\\theta$; the observed large $\\theta$ instead indicates relatively lower surface free energy with respect to water.

Two core design principles for porous scaffolds follow:\n\n1) Interconnected porosity: The pore network must form continuous pathways from the exterior to the interior so that cells and nascent blood vessels can physically traverse the scaffold and so that mass transport pathways for nutrients and waste exist. Interconnectivity lowers transport barriers by decreasing tortuosity and enabling both diffusive and, when perfused, convective transport. In porous media terms, interconnectivity increases effective diffusivity, often described qualitatively by $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\varepsilon D/\\tau$ with porosity $\\varepsilon$ and tortuosity $\\tau$, and increases permeability $k$, thereby facilitating pre-vascular mass transport and, critically, enabling the ingrowth of vasculature.\n\n2) Appropriate pore size: The characteristic pore size $d_{\\mathrm{pore}}$ must satisfy $d_{\\mathrm{pore}}\\gtrsim \\max\\!\\left(d_{\\mathrm{cell}},d_{\\mathrm{cap}}\\right)$, where $d_{\\mathrm{cell}}$ is a representative diameter of bone-forming cells and $d_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ is the characteristic diameter of capillaries or vascular sprouts. Pores on the order of hundreds of micrometers, such as $d_{\\mathrm{pore}}\\approx 250\\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$, are engineered specifically to allow osteoblast migration and, importantly, capillary ingrowth (angiogenesis) into the scaffold’s interior. Without sufficient size and interconnectivity, the interior remains avascular and hypoxic once the diffusion limit is exceeded, leading to cell death and failed regeneration.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because maximizing stiffness conflicts with high, interconnected porosity; elastic modulus $E$ generally decreases with increasing porosity, often scaling like $E\\propto (1-\\varepsilon)^{n}$ for some $n>0$. Immediate physiological load bearing is not the primary function of a highly porous, biodegradable scaffold.\n- Option C is incorrect because a pore diameter on the order of $250\\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ is a microscale architectural feature, not a nanoscale surface texture; protein adsorption is governed primarily by surface chemistry and nanoscale topography, not by macropore size.\n- Option D is incorrect because interconnected porosity increases the internal surface area accessible to fluids and accelerates fluid ingress; it does not minimize exposed surface area, nor is macropore size the primary lever for precisely tuning degradation.\n- Option E is incorrect because long-term controlled release from the bulk polymer is dominated by polymer degradation kinetics and molecular diffusion, not primarily by macropore size in this range; pore size at this scale is not the principal mechanism for release control.\n\nTherefore, the primary and most critical reason for an interconnected pore network with $d_{\\mathrm{pore}}\\approx 250\\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ is to enable cell migration and angiogenesis throughout the scaffold, which is essential for viable bone regeneration in a critical-sized defect.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1286327"}, {"introduction": "Many advanced biomaterials, particularly in orthopedics, are designed to be \"bioresorbable\"—they provide support during healing and then safely degrade and disappear.
