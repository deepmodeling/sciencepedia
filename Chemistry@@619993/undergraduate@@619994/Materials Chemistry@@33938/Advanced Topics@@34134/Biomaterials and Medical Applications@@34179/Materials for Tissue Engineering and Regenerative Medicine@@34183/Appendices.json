{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "In tissue engineering, a scaffold's success depends not only on its structural integrity but also on its ability to support cell life. A critical first step for cells like osteoblasts is adhering to the material surface, a process heavily influenced by surface chemistry. This exercise challenges you to think like a materials designer, addressing the common problem of poor cell attachment on hydrophobic polymers by selecting an appropriate surface modification technique that preserves the scaffold's essential bulk properties [@problem_id:1314315].", "problem": "A research team in a regenerative medicine lab is developing a novel bone scaffold using a 3D-printable polymer, Polycaprolactone (PCL). Initial biocompatibility tests confirm that the material is non-toxic. However, when human osteoblast (bone-forming) cells are seeded onto the PCL scaffold, the team observes very poor cell attachment and subsequent proliferation. The lead scientist hypothesizes that the issue stems from the intrinsically hydrophobic (water-repelling) nature of the PCL surface, which is not conducive to the adsorption of proteins necessary for cell adhesion. The team needs to implement a surface modification technique to address this problem without altering the bulk mechanical properties or the intricate 3D-printed architecture of the scaffold.\n\nGiven the goal of increasing the hydrophilicity of the PCL surface to promote cell adhesion, which of the following common surface modification strategies would be the most direct and effective solution?\n\nA. Treating the scaffold surface with an atmospheric or low-pressure oxygen plasma.\n\nB. Coating the scaffold with a thin, uniform layer of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).\n\nC. Increasing the average pore size of the scaffold's 3D-printed structure from 300 micrometers to 600 micrometers.\n\nD. Annealing the scaffold by heating it to a temperature just below the melting point of PCL and holding it for several hours.\n\nE. Immersing the scaffold in a sterile, deionized water bath for 24 hours prior to cell seeding.", "solution": "The objective is to increase surface hydrophilicity to enhance protein adsorption and osteoblast adhesion while preserving the bulk mechanical properties and the 3D-printed architecture. Surface wettability is governed by surface energy and chemistry. Young’s equation relates the equilibrium contact angle $\\theta$ to interfacial energies:\n$$\n\\gamma_{SV} = \\gamma_{SL} + \\gamma_{LV} \\cos \\theta,\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{SV}$ is the solid-vapor interfacial energy, $\\gamma_{SL}$ is the solid-liquid interfacial energy, and $\\gamma_{LV}$ is the liquid-vapor interfacial energy. Increasing hydrophilicity corresponds to decreasing $\\theta$, which can be achieved by increasing $\\gamma_{SV}$ and/or decreasing $\\gamma_{SL}$ through the introduction of polar functional groups on the surface. This enhances protein adsorption that mediates cell adhesion.\n\nEvaluate each option against the requirements:\n- A. Atmospheric or low-pressure oxygen plasma introduces oxygen-containing polar groups (such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl) onto the polymer surface via surface activation and mild oxidation, thereby increasing $\\gamma_{SV}$ and decreasing $\\theta$ per Young’s equation. Plasma treatment is inherently surface-limited (modifying only the top nanometers), so it preserves bulk mechanical properties and the macro-architecture of the 3D-printed scaffold. This directly increases hydrophilicity and is widely validated for Polycaprolactone.\n- B. Polytetrafluoroethylene has very low surface energy and is strongly hydrophobic, which would decrease $\\gamma_{SV}$ and increase $\\theta$, thereby reducing protein adsorption and worsening cell adhesion. This is the opposite of the goal.\n- C. Increasing average pore size alters macro-architecture and potentially mechanical properties; it does not directly change surface chemistry or increase hydrophilicity. While it may influence mass transport and cell infiltration, it is not a direct solution to poor protein-mediated adhesion on a hydrophobic surface.\n- D. Annealing near the melting point changes crystallinity and can alter mechanical properties and possibly surface topography, but it does not introduce polar functional groups or systematically increase surface energy. It is not a direct hydrophilicity-enhancing method and risks altering bulk properties.\n- E. Immersion in water does not covalently modify the surface or introduce stable polar groups. Any transient wetting effect will not persist after drying and does not reliably reduce $\\theta$ or increase $\\gamma_{SV}$ in a sustained way.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and effective strategy to increase hydrophilicity while preserving bulk and architectural features is oxygen plasma treatment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1314315"}, {"introduction": "Beyond initial cell attachment, the long-term behavior of a biodegradable scaffold is paramount. As materials like poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) break down, they release chemical byproducts that can dramatically alter the local environment.
