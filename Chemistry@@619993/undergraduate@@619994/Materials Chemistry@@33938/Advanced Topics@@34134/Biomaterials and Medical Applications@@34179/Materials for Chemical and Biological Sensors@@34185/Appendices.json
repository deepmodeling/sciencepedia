The sensor operates via a colorimetric assay based on the aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The signal amplification is achieved through a process known as Catalytic Hairpin Assembly (CHA).\n\nThe system consists of two types of DNA hairpins, H1 and H2, which are present in a solution at equal initial concentrations. One population of AuNPs is functionalized with hairpin H1, and a second population is functionalized with hairpin H2. In the absence of the target DNA (T), the hairpins remain in their stable, closed conformations, and the AuNPs are well-dispersed, giving the solution a characteristic red color.\n\nWhen the target DNA strand (T) is introduced, it binds to the loop region of hairpin H1, causing it to open. This initiation step is the rate-limiting step of the entire process, governed by a bimolecular rate constant, $k_{cat}$. The newly formed T-H1 complex then rapidly binds to hairpin H2. This interaction forms a stable, rigid H1-H2 duplex, which displaces and releases the target strand T. The released target T is then free to catalyze another round of hairpin assembly. Each H1-H2 duplex formed acts as a rigid linker, causing the cross-linking and subsequent aggregation of the two types of AuNPs. This aggregation leads to a visible color change from red to blue.\n\nConsider a scenario where the initial concentration of the target DNA is $[T]_0 = 2.50 \\text{ pM}$, and the initial concentrations of the hairpins are $[H1]_0 = [H2]_0 = 120 \\text{ nM}$.
