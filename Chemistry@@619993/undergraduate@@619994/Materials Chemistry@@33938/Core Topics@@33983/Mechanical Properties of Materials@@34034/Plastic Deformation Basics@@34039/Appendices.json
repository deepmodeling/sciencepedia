This first practice focuses on interpreting the resulting stress-strain curve, a fundamental skill for any materials engineer. You will explore the critical distinction between engineering stress and true stress, particularly after the onset of necking, to understand how a material's intrinsic strengthening behavior can be masked by geometric changes in the test specimen [@problem_id:1324187].", "problem": "During a uniaxial tensile test on a cylindrical specimen of a ductile metal, two different measures of stress are commonly calculated. **Engineering stress**, $\\sigma_E$, is defined as the applied load, $F$, divided by the initial cross-sectional area of the specimen, $A_0$. **True stress**, $\\sigma_T$, is defined as the applied load, $F$, divided by the instantaneous cross-sectional area, $A_i$, at that specific load.\n\nA typical experimental observation for a ductile metal is that as the material is stretched, both the engineering and true stress values increase. However, after the engineering stress reaches a maximum value, known as the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS), the subsequent paths of the two curves diverge significantly. The engineering stress-strain curve begins to slope downwards, while the true stress-strain curve continues to rise until the point of fracture.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete physical explanation for why the engineering stress decreases after the UTS while the true stress continues to increase?\n\nA. After the UTS, the specimen begins to \"neck,\" causing a localized, rapid reduction in its cross-sectional area. This geometric instability means a lower applied load is needed to continue deformation, causing the engineering stress (based on a constant original area) to fall. However, the material in the neck continues to strain harden, and the true stress (based on the rapidly shrinking instantaneous area) correctly reflects this increasing intrinsic material strength.\n\nB. The UTS marks the point where the material's capacity for strain hardening is exhausted. Beyond this point, the material experiences \"strain softening,\" becoming intrinsically weaker. This fundamental weakening requires a lower applied load for further deformation, causing both engineering and true stress to decrease, although the effect is more pronounced in the engineering stress calculation.\n\nC. After the UTS, the deformation mechanism changes from being uniform along the specimen to being dominated by the formation and propagation of microcracks. The engineering stress, which averages the stress over the entire original volume, drops as the effective load-bearing area is reduced by these cracks. The true stress, measured only at the fracture point, increases due to stress concentrations at the crack tips.\n\nD. The divergence is an artifact of the definition of engineering strain. As deformation becomes large past the UTS, the engineering strain approximation, $\\epsilon_E = \\Delta L / L_0$, significantly underestimates the actual deformation. When engineering stress is plotted against the more accurate true strain, this apparent drop after the UTS disappears.\n\nE. At the UTS, the rate of strain hardening is exactly balanced by the rate of thermal softening caused by the heat generated during plastic deformation. Beyond the UTS, thermal softening dominates, making the material easier to deform and causing the required load, and thus the engineering stress, to decrease. True stress increases because it is a measure corrected for temperature effects.", "solution": "Let the applied tensile load be $F$, the initial cross-sectional area be $A_{0}$, and the instantaneous area at load $F$ be $A_{i}$. Engineering stress and true stress are defined by\n$$\\sigma_{E}=\\frac{F}{A_{0}},\\qquad \\sigma_{T}=\\frac{F}{A_{i}}.$$\nFor plastic deformation of a ductile metal under uniaxial tension, the plastic flow is approximately incompressible, so the volume remains nearly constant. With initial length $L_{0}$ and current length $L_{i}$, this gives\n$$A_{i}L_{i}=A_{0}L_{0}.$$\nDefine the true (logarithmic) strain by\n$$\\epsilon_{T}=\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{L_{i}}{L_{0}}\\right).$$\nThen\n$$\\frac{A_{i}}{A_{0}}=\\frac{L_{0}}{L_{i}}=\\exp(-\\epsilon_{T}).$$\nRelating engineering and true stress via $F=\\sigma_{T}A_{i}$ yields\n$$\\sigma_{E}=\\frac{F}{A_{0}}=\\sigma_{T}\\frac{A_{i}}{A_{0}}=\\sigma_{T}\\exp(-\\epsilon_{T}).$$\nDifferentiate $\\sigma_{E}$ with respect to $\\epsilon_{T}$:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma_{E}}{d\\epsilon_{T}}=\\exp(-\\epsilon_{T})\\left(\\frac{d\\sigma_{T}}{d\\epsilon_{T}}-\\sigma_{T}\\right).$$\nThe maximum of the engineering stress (the UTS) occurs when $\\frac{d\\sigma_{E}}{d\\epsilon_{T}}=0$, i.e.\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma_{T}}{d\\epsilon_{T}}=\\sigma_{T},$$\nwhich is the Considère criterion for the onset of necking. Beyond this point (after UTS), the deformation localizes into a neck so that the instantaneous area $A_{i}$ decreases rapidly. In this regime one has\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma_{T}}{d\\epsilon_{T}}<\\sigma_{T},$$\nand therefore\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma_{E}}{d\\epsilon_{T}}<0,$$\nso the engineering stress decreases with further strain. However, as long as the material continues to strain harden so that $\\frac{d\\sigma_{T}}{d\\epsilon_{T}}>0$, the true stress $\\sigma_{T}$ continues to increase with $\\epsilon_{T}$ up to fracture.\n\nEquivalently, the load $F=\\sigma_{T}A_{i}=\\sigma_{T}A_{0}\\exp(-\\epsilon_{T})$ satisfies\n$$\\frac{dF}{d\\epsilon_{T}}=A_{0}\\exp(-\\epsilon_{T})\\left(\\frac{d\\sigma_{T}}{d\\epsilon_{T}}-\\sigma_{T}\\right),$$\nso $F$ reaches a maximum at the Considère condition and then decreases because the rapid geometric reduction in $A_{i}$ in the neck outweighs the ongoing increase in $\\sigma_{T}$ due to strain hardening. Consequently, engineering stress, which uses the constant $A_{0}$, falls after UTS because the required load falls, whereas true stress, referenced to the shrinking $A_{i}$ in the neck, correctly reflects the increasing intrinsic flow strength of the material.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is that necking introduces a geometric instability that reduces the required load and thus engineering stress, while the material in the neck continues to strain harden, so true stress continues to rise. This corresponds to option A. The other options are inconsistent with standard tensile behavior: B incorrectly asserts intrinsic strain softening in typical ductile metals; C mischaracterizes the dominant mechanism and the definition of true stress; D incorrectly attributes the divergence to strain measure rather than the area change, which remains even when using true strain; and E invokes thermal softening and a temperature correction in true stress that are not part of the definition and are not the general cause in quasi-static tests.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1324187"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative interpretation to quantitative prediction is a key step in engineering analysis. This exercise builds directly upon the concept of necking by applying a mathematical model, the Hollomon power-law, which is widely used to describe the strain-hardening behavior of ductile metals.

Necking begins when the tensile load, $P$, on the specimen reaches its maximum value. At this maximum, the differential of the load is zero, i.e., $dP = 0$.\n\nThe load $P$ can be expressed as the product of the true stress $\\sigma_T$ and the instantaneous cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$P = \\sigma_T A$$\nTo find the maximum load, we differentiate this expression with respect to a variable that describes the deformation, such as the true strain $\\epsilon_T$, and set the result to zero. Using the product rule:\n$$\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon_T} = A \\frac{d\\sigma_T}{d\\epsilon_T} + \\sigma_T \\frac{dA}{d\\epsilon_T} = 0$$\nThis can be rewritten in differential form as:\n$$A \\,d\\sigma_T + \\sigma_T \\,dA = 0$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$-\\frac{dA}{A} = \\frac{d\\sigma_T}{\\sigma_T}$$\nThis equation gives a general condition for instability.

At this point, the strengthening effect of work hardening can no longer compensate for the weakening effect of the decreasing cross-sectional area.\n\nThe problem provides the Hollomon equation for the material's behavior: $\\sigma_T = K \\epsilon_T^n$. We can now use this to solve for the true strain at the onset of necking.\nFirst, we find the derivative of the true stress with respect to the true strain:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma_T}{d\\epsilon_T} = \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon_T}(K \\epsilon_T^n) = K n \\epsilon_T^{n-1}$$\nNow, we substitute both $\\sigma_T$ and its derivative into Considère's criterion:\n$$K n \\epsilon_T^{n-1} = K \\epsilon_T^n$$\nWe can divide both sides by $K \\epsilon_T^{n-1}$ (assuming $\\epsilon_T \\neq 0$ and $K \\neq 0$), which simplifies the equation to:\n$$n = \\epsilon_T$$\nThis elegant result shows that for a material following the Hollomon law, necking begins when the true plastic strain becomes numerically equal to the strain-hardening exponent, $n$.
