In real materials, dislocation lines are not perfectly straight and their movement can be impeded by defects such as jogs, which act as local hurdles.

Consider a single crystal of pure copper being deformed at a constant elevated temperature. The dominant mechanism for this deformation is the glide of screw dislocations. During their motion, these dislocations intersect with other dislocations, a process that creates \"jogs\" along their line length. A jog is a step on a dislocation line which is not parallel to the primary slip plane of the main dislocation.\n\nFor a screw dislocation, a jog has an edge dislocation character. For the screw dislocation to continue gliding on its primary slip plane, this edge-character jog must be dragged along.

This vacancy creation is a thermally activated process and acts as a drag force, impeding the dislocation's motion.\n\nThe velocity, $v$, of such a jogged screw dislocation can be described by the following equation, which models the rate of thermally activated jog dragging:\n$$v = v_d \\exp\\left( -\\frac{U_v - \\tau b^2 l_j}{k_B T} \\right)$$\nHere, $v_d$ is a jump frequency factor related to atomic vibration frequencies, $U_v$ is the energy required to form a single vacancy, $\\tau$ is the applied shear stress driving the dislocation, $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, $l_j$ is the average spacing between jogs along the dislocation line, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nGiven the following parameters for copper at the temperature of interest:\n- Target dislocation velocity, $v = 2.50 \\times 10^{-6}$ m/s\n- Jump frequency factor, $v_d = 5.00 \\times 10^3$ m/s\n- Vacancy formation energy, $U_v = 1.05$ eV\n- Burgers vector magnitude, $b = 0.256$ nm\n- Average jog spacing, $l_j = 120$ nm\n- Absolute temperature, $T = 600$ K\n- Boltzmann constant, $k_B = 8.617 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/K\n\nCalculate the shear stress $\\tau$ that must be applied to the slip system to achieve the target dislocation velocity.
