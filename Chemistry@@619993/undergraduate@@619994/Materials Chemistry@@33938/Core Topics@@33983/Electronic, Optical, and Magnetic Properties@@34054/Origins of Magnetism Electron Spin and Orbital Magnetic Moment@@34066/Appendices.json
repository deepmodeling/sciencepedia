Each unpaired electron has an individual spin quantum number of $s = 1/2$. When multiple unpaired electrons are present in an atom or ion, their spins align in the same direction to maximize the total spin, according to Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity.\n\nThe total spin quantum number $S$ is the sum of the individual spin quantum numbers of the unpaired electrons. Let $n$ be the number of unpaired electrons.\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i$$\nSince each unpaired electron has $s_i = 1/2$ and they all align, this simplifies to:\n$$S = n \\times \\frac{1}{2}$$\nIn this problem, we are given that the $Cr^{3+}$ ion has $n=3$ unpaired electrons. Therefore, the total spin quantum number is:\n$$S = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nNext, we calculate the spin multiplicity.

The calculation requires several steps: first, determining the quantum numbers $L$, $S$, and $J$ from the term symbol; second, calculating the Landé g-factor, $g_J$; and finally, calculating $\\mu_{eff}$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the quantum numbers L, S, and J.**\n\nThe ground state term symbol is given in the standard Russell-Saunders format, $^{2S+1}L_J$. For $Gd^{3+}$, the symbol is $^8S_{7/2}$. By comparing the general form with the given symbol, we can extract the quantum numbers.\n\n- The superscript is the spin multiplicity, $2S+1 = 8$. Solving for the total spin quantum number $S$, we get $2S = 7$, which gives $S = 7/2$.\n- The letter code 'S' represents the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$. The codes S, P, D, F, G, ... correspond to $L = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...$ respectively. Therefore, for an 'S' state, we have $L=0$.\n- The subscript is the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$. From the term symbol, we can directly read $J = 7/2$.\n(As a self-consistency check, the values of $J$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series $|L-S| \\le J \\le L+S$. With $L=0$ and $S=7/2$, we have $|0-7/2| \\le J \\le 0+7/2$, which simplifies to $J=7/2$. Our value is consistent.)\n\nSo, we have: $L=0$, $S=7/2$, and $J=7/2$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Landé g-factor ($g_J$).**\n\nThe formula for the Landé g-factor is:\n$$ g_J = 1 + \\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{2J(J+1)} $$\nFirst, we calculate the terms involving the quantum numbers:\n- $J(J+1) = \\frac{7}{2} \\left(\\frac{7}{2} + 1\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{63}{4}$\n- $S(S+1) = \\frac{7}{2} \\left(\\frac{7}{2} + 1\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{63}{4}$\n- $L(L+1) = 0(0+1) = 0$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula for $g_J$:\n$$ g_J = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{63}{4} + \\frac{63}{4} - 0}{2 \\left(\\frac{63}{4}\\right)} = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{126}{4}}{\\frac{126}{4}} = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\nThe Landé g-factor for the ground state of $Gd^{3+}$ is exactly 2. This is characteristic of any state with zero orbital angular momentum ($L=0$).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the effective magnetic moment ($\\mu_{eff}$).**\n\nThe formula for the effective magnetic moment is:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = g_J \\sqrt{J(J+1)} \\mu_B $$\nWe have already calculated $g_J=2$ and $J(J+1) = 63/4$. Substituting these values:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{63}{4}} \\mu_B $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = 2 \\frac{\\sqrt{63}}{\\sqrt{4}} \\mu_B = 2 \\frac{\\sqrt{63}}{2} \\mu_B = \\sqrt{63} \\mu_B $$\nTo get the numerical value, we compute the square root of 63:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 7} \\mu_B = 3\\sqrt{7} \\mu_B $$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.645751...$:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} \\approx 3 \\times 2.645751... \\mu_B \\approx 7.937253... \\mu_B $$\n\n**Step 4: Round the final answer.**\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\mu_{eff} \\approx 7.937 \\mu_B $$\nThe unit of the answer is Bohr magnetons ($\\mu_B$), so the numerical value to be reported is 7.937.\n\nIt is worth noting that for states with $L=0$, the total angular momentum is purely from spin ($J=S$). The general formula for $\\mu_{eff}$ simplifies to $\\mu_{eff} = 2\\sqrt{S(S+1)}\\mu_B$. The electronic configuration of $Gd^{3+}$ is $[\\text{Xe}]\\,4f^7$, meaning it has 7 unpaired electrons ($n=7$), so $S=n/2=7/2$. The spin-only formula for magnetic moment is often given as $\\mu_{SO} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}\\mu_B = \\sqrt{7(7+2)}\\mu_B = \\sqrt{63}\\mu_B$. This demonstrates that for an S-state ion like $Gd^{3+}$, the full treatment involving the Landé g-factor gives a result identical to the simpler spin-only approximation because the orbital contribution is zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.937}$$", "id": "1320272"}]}
