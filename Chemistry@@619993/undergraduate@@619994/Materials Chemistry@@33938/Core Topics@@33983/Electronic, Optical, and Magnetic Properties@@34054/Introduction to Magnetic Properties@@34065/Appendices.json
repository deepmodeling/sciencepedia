In this structure, the cations occupy two types of crystal lattice sites: tetrahedral (A-sites) and octahedral (B-sites). The magnetic moments of all ions on A-sites form a single magnetic sublattice (sublattice A), and the moments of all ions on B-sites form a second sublattice (sublattice B).\n2.  **Cation Distribution**: For this material, you must first determine the proportions of $Fe^{2+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$ ions required for overall charge neutrality, assuming all manganese is present as $Mn^{2+}$. The inverse spinel structure dictates that one trivalent cation per formula unit occupies the A-site, with all other cations (both divalent and the remaining trivalent) occupying the B-sites.\n3.  **Magnetic Alignment**: The net magnetic moment of sublattice A is aligned antiparallel to the net magnetic moment of sublattice B.
