A real capacitor with a dielectric material can be modeled as an ideal capacitor with capacitance $C_p$ in parallel with a resistor with conductance $G_p = 1/R_p$. The complex admittance of this parallel circuit is $Y^* = G_p + i\\omega C_p$, where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency.\n\nThe complex capacitance, $C^*$, is related to the complex admittance by $Y^* = i\\omega C^*$.
