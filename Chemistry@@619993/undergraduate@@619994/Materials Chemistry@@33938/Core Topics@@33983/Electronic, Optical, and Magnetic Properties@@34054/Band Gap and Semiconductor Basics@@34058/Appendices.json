The fundamental principle governing this is the condition of charge neutrality. In a semiconductor at thermal equilibrium, the total positive charge density must equal the total negative charge density. The species contributing to charge are free electrons (negative), free holes (positive), ionized acceptor atoms (negative), and ionized donor atoms (positive). The charge neutrality equation is:\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nwhere $p$ is the hole concentration, $n$ is the electron concentration, $N_D^+$ is the ionized donor concentration, and $N_A^-$ is the ionized acceptor concentration.\n\nThe problem states that we can assume all dopant atoms are fully ionized at the operating temperature. This simplification means that every donor atom has donated an electron, and every acceptor atom has accepted an electron. Therefore, we can set $N_D^+ \\approx N_D$ and $N_A^- \\approx N_A$. The charge neutrality equation becomes:\n$$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\n\nWe are given the following concentrations:\nDonor concentration, $N_D = 6.8 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}$\nAcceptor concentration, $N_A = 1.3 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n\nFirst, we determine the type of the semiconductor (n-type or p-type). This is determined by the net effective doping. Since the donor concentration $N_D$ is greater than the acceptor concentration $N_A$, the material is n-type. This means that electrons are the majority carriers and holes are the minority carriers. Thus, we expect $n > p$.\n\nFor an n-type material, the electron concentration $n$ will be much larger than the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$. According to the mass action law ($np=n_i^2$), it follows that the hole concentration $p$ will be much smaller than $n_i$. Therefore, for a moderately or heavily doped n-type semiconductor, it is a very good approximation to assume $n \\gg p$.\n\nWith this approximation, we can simplify the charge neutrality equation:\n$$p + N_D \\approx n + N_A$$\nSince $n \\gg p$, we can neglect $p$ on the left side, which gives us an expression for the majority carrier concentration, $n$:\n$$n \\approx N_D - N_A$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values to calculate the majority carrier concentration:\n$$n \\approx (6.8 \\times 10^{16} - 1.3 \\times 10^{16}) \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}$$\n$$n \\approx 5.5 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the minority carrier concentration, $p$.
