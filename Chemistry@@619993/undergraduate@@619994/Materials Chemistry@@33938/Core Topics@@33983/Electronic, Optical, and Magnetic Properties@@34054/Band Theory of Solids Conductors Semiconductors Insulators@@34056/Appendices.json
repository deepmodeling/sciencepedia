This first exercise allows you to explore the fundamental concept of creating a p-type semiconductor by intentionally introducing impurity atoms into a pure crystal lattice. Understanding how this process creates mobile positive charges, or \"holes,\" is the first step toward designing virtually all modern electronic components [@problem_id:1979694].", "problem": "In the manufacturing of modern electronic components, the process of doping is critical for controlling the electrical properties of semiconductors. Consider a pure crystalline semiconductor material composed entirely of atoms from Group 14 of the periodic table. This intrinsic semiconductor is then 'doped' by introducing a small quantity of an impurity element from Group 13. When an impurity atom from Group 13 substitutes an original atom in the crystal lattice, this fundamentally alters the material's charge-carrying capabilities.\n\nSelect the option that correctly identifies the type of extrinsic semiconductor produced and its corresponding majority charge carriers.\n\nA. Type: n-type; Majority Charge Carriers: electrons\nB. Type: p-type; Majority Charge Carriers: holes\nC. Type: n-type; Majority Charge Carriers: holes\nD. Type: p-type; Majority Charge Carriers: electrons\nE. The material remains intrinsic, with an equal concentration of electrons and holes as charge carriers.", "solution": "We start from an intrinsic semiconductor composed of Group 14 atoms (e.g., Si or Ge). In an intrinsic semiconductor, the thermally generated electron and hole concentrations are equal, so by definition\n$$\nn = p = n_{i},\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the electron concentration in the conduction band, $p$ is the hole concentration in the valence band, and $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.\n\nIntroduce substitutional dopants from Group 13 (trivalent). A Group 13 atom has $3$ valence electrons, while each Group 14 host atom forms $4$ covalent bonds in the crystal. When a trivalent impurity substitutes a host atom, it lacks one electron to complete the fourth bond, leaving an electron deficiency that can be filled by capturing an electron from the valence band. This creates:\n- an acceptor level near the valence band that becomes negatively charged when it captures an electron,\n- a hole in the valence band as a mobile positive charge carrier.\n\nHence, Group 13 dopants act as acceptors with concentration $N_{A}$, and the semiconductor becomes p-type. In equilibrium, carrier concentrations obey the mass action law\n$$\nn p = n_{i}^{2}.\n$$\nCharge neutrality requires\n$$\np - n + N_{D}^{+} - N_{A}^{-} = 0,\n$$\nand with only acceptors present, $N_{D}^{+} = 0$. For shallow acceptors at typical temperatures, we have near-complete ionization so $N_{A}^{-} \\approx N_{A}$, giving\n$$\np - n \\approx N_{A}.\n$$\nCombining with $n p = n_{i}^{2}$ and for $N_{A} \\gg n_{i}$, we obtain approximately\n$$\np \\approx N_{A}, \\quad n \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}},\n$$\nwhich shows $p \\gg n$. Therefore, holes are the majority carriers and the material is p-type.\n\nThus, the correct option is: Type: p-type; Majority Charge Carriers: holes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1979694"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a qualitative to a quantitative understanding, this next practice demonstrates how doping precisely positions the Fermi level ($E_F$) within the band gap.
