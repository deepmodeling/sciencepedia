The chemical repeat unit for polyethylene is $(-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-)_{n}$, which results in a molecule with a symmetric charge distribution and no net permanent dipole moment.

Polyethylene: Orientational Polarization; PVC: Ionic Polarization", "solution": "We analyze dielectric polarization mechanisms under a low-frequency alternating electric field at room temperature using the standard decomposition of polarization into contributions:\n$$\nP = P_{\\text{el}} + P_{\\text{ion}} + P_{\\text{or}} + P_{\\text{int}},\n$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{el}}$ is electronic (distortion of electron clouds relative to nuclei), $P_{\\text{ion}}$ is ionic (relative displacement of ions in an ionic lattice), $P_{\\text{or}}$ is orientational or dipolar (field-induced alignment of permanent molecular dipoles), and $P_{\\text{int}}$ is interfacial or Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars polarization. The dominant mechanism at a given frequency is determined by whether the characteristic relaxation time $\\tau$ of the mechanism satisfies $\\omega \\tau \\ll 1$ for the applied angular frequency $\\omega$, and by whether the required microscopic features (e.g., permanent dipoles or ionic lattice) are present.\n\nFor polyethylene with repeat unit $(-\\text{CH}_{2}-\\text{CH}_{2}-)_{n}$, the molecule is nonpolar with a symmetric charge distribution. Therefore, there are no permanent dipoles and thus $P_{\\text{or}}=0$. Polyethylene is a covalently bonded organic solid without an ionic lattice, so $P_{\\text{ion}}$ is negligible. In a homogeneous, pure polymer sample, $P_{\\text{int}}$ is not the primary intrinsic mechanism. This leaves electronic polarization $P_{\\text{el}}$ as the primary mechanism. Electronic polarization has a very short relaxation time and is active at all frequencies up to optical, so it governs the dielectric response in the absence of other mechanisms.\n\nFor polyvinyl chloride with repeat unit $(-\\text{CH}_{2}-\\text{CHCl}-)_{n}$, the C–Cl bond is highly polar due to the electronegativity of chlorine, creating permanent molecular dipoles along the chain. At room temperature and low frequency, the condition $\\omega \\tau_{\\text{or}} \\ll 1$ for dipolar rotation is satisfied, so these permanent dipoles can reorient with the field, making $P_{\\text{or}}$ the dominant contribution. Electronic polarization $P_{\\text{el}}$ is always present but is not primary when orientational polarization is available and can follow the field at low frequency.\n\nTherefore, under the specified conditions, the primary mechanism is electronic polarization for polyethylene and orientational polarization for PVC, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1294570"}, {"introduction": "The presence of permanent dipoles is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for strong orientational polarization. This thought experiment explores the crucial role of molecular mobility by examining the dramatic change in the dielectric constant when liquid water freezes into ice. Understanding this classic phenomenon [@problem_id:1294592] provides deep insight into how a material's physical state can govern its response to an electric field.", "problem": "The dielectric constant is a fundamental property of a material that quantifies its ability to store electrical energy when placed in an electric field. An interesting phenomenon is observed when comparing liquid water to solid ice. For an applied alternating electric field with a frequency in the kilohertz (kHz) to megahertz (MHz) range, the relative dielectric constant of pure liquid water is approximately 80. However, upon freezing, the relative dielectric constant of ice in the same frequency range drops dramatically to a value of approximately 3.\n\nGiven that a water molecule ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) possesses a significant permanent electric dipole moment, what is the primary physical reason for this large decrease in the dielectric constant upon the phase transition from liquid water to solid ice?\n\nA. The average distance between molecules increases when water freezes into ice, leading to a lower density of dipoles per unit volume.\n\nB. The electronic polarization is significantly reduced because the electron clouds of the molecules are more tightly bound in the rigid crystal lattice of ice.\n\nC. The contribution from orientational polarization becomes negligible because the water molecules are locked in place within the ice crystal lattice and cannot freely rotate to align with the external field.\n\nD. The ionic polarization mechanism, involving the stretching of O-H bonds, is eliminated as molecular vibrations cease at the freezing point.\n\nE. The applied electric field in this frequency range causes the ice crystal lattice to resonate, dissipating energy and preventing effective polarization.", "solution": "We model the dielectric response via the polarization-density relation and the dielectric susceptibility. For a material subjected to an electric field $E$, the polarization $P$ is\n$$\nP = \\epsilon_{0} \\chi E,\n$$\nand the relative dielectric constant satisfies\n$$\n\\epsilon_{r} = 1 + \\chi.\n$$\nIn polar materials, the total susceptibility can be decomposed into additive contributions from different microscopic mechanisms,\n$$\n\\chi = \\chi_{\\text{el}} + \\chi_{\\text{ion}} + \\chi_{\\text{or}},\n$$\nwhere $\\chi_{\\text{el}}$ is electronic (displacement of electron clouds relative to nuclei), $\\chi_{\\text{ion}}$ is ionic (relative displacement of ions in a lattice or internal molecular vibrational displacements), and $\\chi_{\\text{or}}$ is orientational (alignment of permanent dipoles).\n\nFor a permanent dipole moment $\\mu$ with number density $N$ in thermal equilibrium, the static orientational susceptibility (in a liquid where rotation is possible) is given by the Langevin-Debye result\n$$\n\\chi_{\\text{or}}(0) = \\frac{N \\mu^{2}}{3 \\epsilon_{0} k_{B} T}.\n$$\nDynamically, the orientational response exhibits Debye relaxation with a characteristic rotational relaxation time $\\tau$,\n$$\n\\chi_{\\text{or}}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\chi_{\\text{or}}(0)}{1 + i \\omega \\tau},\n$$\nso that for $\\omega \\tau \\ll 1$ one has $\\Re[\\chi_{\\text{or}}(\\omega)] \\approx \\chi_{\\text{or}}(0)$ (large orientational contribution), and for $\\omega \\tau \\gg 1$ one has $\\Re[\\chi_{\\text{or}}(\\omega)] \\approx 0$ (orientational contribution suppressed).\n\nIn liquid water, molecules rotate freely on timescales far shorter than kHz–MHz periods, so $\\omega \\tau \\ll 1$ in this band. Hence, $\\chi_{\\text{or}}$ is large and adds to $\\chi_{\\text{el}}$ and $\\chi_{\\text{ion}}$, producing $\\epsilon_{r} \\approx 80$.\n\nUpon freezing into ice, the water molecules are locked in a rigid hydrogen-bonded lattice and cannot freely reorient in response to the applied field on kHz–MHz timescales. This drastically increases $\\tau$, effectively placing the system in the $\\omega \\tau \\gg 1$ regime for orientational polarization, so that\n$$\n\\chi_{\\text{or}}(\\omega) \\approx 0,\n$$\nand the dielectric constant reduces to\n$$\n\\epsilon_{r} \\approx 1 + \\chi_{\\text{el}} + \\chi_{\\text{ion}}.\n$$\nThe remaining electronic and ionic contributions change only modestly between liquid and solid phases and are comparatively small, yielding a value on the order of a few. Therefore, the large decrease from approximately $80$ to approximately $3$ is explained by the suppression of the orientational (dipolar) polarization in the solid phase.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is insufficient: the change in number density $N$ upon freezing is too small to account for the drop from approximately $80$ to approximately $3$; the dominant effect is the loss of orientational freedom (not merely $N$).\n- B is incorrect: $\\chi_{\\text{el}}$ changes little between liquid and solid and is small in magnitude; it cannot explain the drastic reduction.\n- C is correct: orientational polarization is suppressed because molecules cannot freely rotate in the crystal lattice, eliminating the dominant contribution present in the liquid.\n- D is incorrect: ionic polarization does not vanish at freezing and, in any case, is not the dominant contributor at kHz–MHz.\n- E is incorrect: resonance of the lattice at kHz–MHz is not the relevant mechanism for the observed dielectric behavior and does not explain the low $\\epsilon_{r}$.\n\nTherefore, the primary physical reason is the loss of orientational polarization in ice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1294592"}, {"introduction": "Moving from single-phase materials to engineered structures, this problem asks you to model a multi-layer composite dielectric, a common feature in modern electronic devices.
