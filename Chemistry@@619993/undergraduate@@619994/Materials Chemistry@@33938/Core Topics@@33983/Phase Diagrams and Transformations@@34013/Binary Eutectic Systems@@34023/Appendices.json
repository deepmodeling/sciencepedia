The eutectic point occurs at a composition of 58 wt% Bi and a temperature of 138 °C, where the liquid phase transforms directly into a solid mixture of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe student melts a sample of the alloy and then cools it slowly to room temperature. A metallographic analysis of the resulting solid reveals a microstructure consisting of large, blocky, primary crystals of the $\\beta$ phase, which are surrounded by a fine, alternating lamellar (plate-like) structure composed of both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phases.\n\nBased on this microstructural observation, which of the following statements correctly categorizes the alloy?\n\nA.

Since $C_0 < C_E$, the alloy is classified as hypoeutectic.\n\nStep 2: Describe the solidification process for a hypoeutectic alloy.\nUpon slow cooling from the liquid state, a hypoeutectic alloy first crosses the liquidus line. At this point, solid crystals of the primary phase begin to form. For a hypoeutectic alloy, the primary phase is the A-rich $\\alpha$ phase.
