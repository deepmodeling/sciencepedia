At this temperature, the atoms have enough mobility to begin forming small, spherical precipitates of a new, stable phase. The formation of these precipitates is governed by the principles of classical nucleation theory. The driving force for this transformation is the volumetric free energy change, $\\Delta G_v$, which has a value of $-2.1 \\times 10^8 \\text{ J/m}^3$. However, the formation of a new precipitate creates an interface between the precipitate and the surrounding matrix, which has an associated interfacial energy, $\\gamma$, of $0.35 \\text{ J/m}^2$.

Two different crystallization experiments are conducted.\n\n**Experiment A:** A seed crystal of quantuminide is placed in a solution with a very low degree of supersaturation. The solution is subjected to vigorous, continuous stirring to ensure it remains perfectly homogeneous at all times, even at the microscopic level near the crystal surface.\n\n**Experiment B:** A seed crystal of quantuminide is placed in a stagnant (unstirred) solution with a very high degree of supersaturation. The solution is left completely undisturbed throughout the growth process.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of crystal growth, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected macroscopic morphology of the crystals produced in each experiment?\n\nA.

The thermodynamic driving force per growth unit is $\\Delta \\mu = k_{B} T \\ln(S)$. The normal growth velocity can be limited either by interfacial attachment kinetics or by mass transport (diffusion). A convenient way to express this is\n$$\nv_{n} = \\min\\left[\\beta(\\hat{n})\\,\\Delta \\mu,\\ \\frac{J}{\\rho}\\right],\n$$\nwhere $\\beta(\\hat{n})$ is the anisotropic kinetic coefficient (reflecting crystallographic anisotropy), $J$ is the solute flux to the interface, and $\\rho$ is the incorporation density per unit advance. The diffusive flux near a crystal is\n$$\nJ = -D\\,\\nabla C \\approx D\\,\\frac{C_{\\infty} - C_{s}}{\\delta},\n$$\nwith $D$ the solute diffusivity, $\\delta$ an effective boundary-layer thickness, and $C_{s}$ the interfacial concentration.

The supersaturation is very low, so $\\Delta \\mu$ is small. In this kinetics-limited, low-driving-force regime, growth proceeds by layer advancement on low-index faces. Because $\\beta(\\hat{n})$ is highly anisotropic (as stated), faces with low normal velocity persist while faster-growing directions shrink away, yielding well-developed flat facets that approach the Wulff-like habit. The interface is morphologically stable in this regime (Mullins–Sekerka analysis shows that sufficiently small $\\Delta \\mu$ with kinetics control suppresses amplification of interfacial perturbations). Therefore, faceted polyhedra are expected.\n\nExperiment B: The solution is stagnant, so $\\delta$ is large, and the supersaturation is very high, so $C_{\\infty} - C_{s}$ is large. This places growth in the diffusion-limited regime with $v_{n} \\approx J/\\rho$. The concentration field outside the crystal satisfies $\\nabla^{2}C=0$, so any protrusion into the solution captures a disproportionately larger flux (Laplacian field focusing). Mullins–Sekerka theory predicts that under diffusion control with large driving force, a nominally planar or faceted front becomes morphologically unstable: small perturbations grow, leading to tip formation and branching. Crystallographic anisotropy then selects preferred growth directions for the primary and secondary arms, producing branched dendritic morphologies. Thus, dendrites are expected.\n\nEliminating the alternatives: High supersaturation and stagnant conditions do not favor macroscopic equilibrium faceting (ruling out faceted crystals in Experiment B), while low supersaturation with perfect mixing does not favor dendrites (ruling out dendrites in Experiment A). Spherical particles or thin platelets are not the generic outcomes under the stated controls for an anisotropic crystal; instead, faceted or dendritic shapes dominate as argued.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is: Experiment A yields faceted polyhedra, and Experiment B yields branched dendrites.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1319413"}, {"introduction": "To describe the overall rate of a phase transformation, materials scientists use the powerful Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model.
