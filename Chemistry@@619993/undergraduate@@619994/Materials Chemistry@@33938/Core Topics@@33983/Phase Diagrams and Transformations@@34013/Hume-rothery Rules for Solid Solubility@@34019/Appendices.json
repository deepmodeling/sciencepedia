Smaller differences favor higher solubility, giving the ordering by this criterion: Cr, V, Mn.\n\nAssess valency: Fe commonly exhibits $+2$ and $+3$. V, Cr, and Mn all include $+2$ and $+3$ among their common valencies, so the valency-matching rule does not differentiate them significantly; all are favorable on this basis.

The candidates are A (Cu, FCC), B (Ni, FCC), D (Pd, FCC), E (Al, FCC), C (Zn, HCP), and F (Ti, HCP). Any triplet containing C or F mixes FCC with HCP, violating the strong same-structure rule for extensive solubility. There are only two HCP metals (C and F), so no all-HCP triplet exists. Therefore, restrict to FCC-only triplets from the set $\\{A,B,D,E\\}$, i.e., $\\{A,B,D\\}$, $\\{A,B,E\\}$, $\\{A,D,E\\}$, and $\\{B,D,E\\}$.\n\nSecond, check atomic size mismatch using the relative size difference\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}=\\frac{|r_{i}-r_{j}|}{\\min(r_{i},r_{j})}.\n$$\nCompute for FCC pairs (atomic radii in pm): $r_{A}=128$, $r_{B}=125$, $r_{D}=137$, $r_{E}=143$.\n- $A$–$B$: $\\delta_{AB}=\\frac{|128-125|}{125}=\\frac{3}{125}=0.024$.\n- $A$–$D$: $\\delta_{AD}=\\frac{|128-137|}{128}=\\frac{9}{128}\\approx 0.0703$.\n- $B$–$D$: $\\delta_{BD}=\\frac{|125-137|}{125}=\\frac{12}{125}=0.096$.\n- $A$–$E$: $\\delta_{AE}=\\frac{|128-143|}{128}=\\frac{15}{128}\\approx 0.117$.\n- $B$–$E$: $\\delta_{BE}=\\frac{|125-143|}{125}=\\frac{18}{125}=0.144$.\n- $D$–$E$: $\\delta_{DE}=\\frac{|137-143|}{137}=\\frac{6}{137}\\approx 0.0438$.\nAll these $\\delta_{ij}$ values are less than $0.15$, so any FCC-only triplet satisfies the size rule; among them, $\\{A,B,D\\}$ has smaller worst-case size mismatch than those involving $E$, since its maximum $\\delta$ is $0.096$, compared with $0.144$ or $0.117$ when $E$ is included.\n\nThird, compare electronegativity differences, where small differences favor extensive solid solution and large differences promote intermetallics.

Higher solubility is favored for same or similar valence. Reported common valences: $A$ (Cu) $+1,+2$, $B$ (Ni) $+2,+3$, $D$ (Pd) $+2,+4$, $E$ (Al) $+3$. The transition metal triplet $\\{A,B,D\\}$ has mutually similar transition-metal valences and is empirically known for extensive mutual solubility (e.g., complete Ni–Cu and Ni–Pd series, and highly soluble Cu–Pd), whereas Al with transition metals commonly forms ordered intermetallic compounds (e.g., $\\text{NiAl}$, $\\text{Ni}_3\\text{Al}$, $\\text{CuAl}_2$, $\\text{PdAl}$), contravening the target of a single-phase random substitutional alloy.\n\nSynthesizing the four criteria: only FCC triplets are viable, all pass size; electronegativity and valence considerations clearly disfavor inclusion of $E$ with $D$, and generally $E$ with $A$ or $B$ due to strong compound-forming tendencies.
