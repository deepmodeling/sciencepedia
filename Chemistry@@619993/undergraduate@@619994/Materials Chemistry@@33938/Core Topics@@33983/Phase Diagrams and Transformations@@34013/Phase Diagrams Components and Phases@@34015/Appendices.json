To achieve a single-phase solid solution, the alloy's overall composition $C$ must fall within a single-phase region ($\\alpha$ or $\\beta$) at some temperature $T$ that satisfies the no-melting constraint.\n\n-   To achieve a single **$\\alpha$ phase**, there must exist a temperature $T \\leq T_{\\text{solidus}}(C)$ where the composition $C$ is less than or equal to the solvus line composition, $C \\leq C_{\\alpha}^{\\text{sol}}(T)$.

Thus, it is possible to transform this alloy into a single $\\alpha$ phase. Specifically, by heating the alloy to a temperature where the $\\alpha$ solvus line is to the right of 8 wt% Sb (e.g., any temperature between where the solvus crosses 8 wt% and 485 °C), the alloy will enter the single-phase $\\alpha$ region. Since $C=8  11$, the solidus temperature is above 485 °C, so no melting will occur during this heat treatment. Therefore, solutionizing is **possible** for Alloy 1.\n\n2) **Alloy 2 (C = 15 wt% Sb):**\nThis composition does not satisfy the condition for forming a single $\\alpha$ phase ($C \\leq 11$ wt% Sb) or a single $\\beta$ phase ($C \\geq 96$ wt% Sb). To dissolve the $\\beta$ phase and form a single $\\alpha$ phase, we would need to heat the alloy to a temperature where the solubility of Sb in $\\alpha$ is 15 wt%. However, the maximum solubility is only 11 wt% at 485 °C. For this alloy's composition ($C=15$ wt% Sb), the solidus temperature is exactly 485 °C. Any attempt to heat the alloy above 485 °C to increase solubility would cross the solidus line and cause partial melting (entering the $\\alpha + \\text{Liquid}$ region), which violates the process constraint. Therefore, it is **not possible** to achieve a single-phase solid solution for Alloy 2 through a solid-state process.\n\nConclusion: Solutionizing is possible for Alloy 1, but not for Alloy 2.
