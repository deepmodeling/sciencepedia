Two critical invariant reactions on this diagram are the eutectic and eutectoid transformations. Consider two distinct iron-carbon alloys, Alloy A and Alloy B, cooled under equilibrium conditions from a temperature where they are both entirely liquid.\n\nAlloy A has the eutectic composition of 4.3 wt% carbon.

The eutectoid reaction occurs at a temperature of $727^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, the following definitions are provided:\n-   **Austenite ($\\gamma$):** A solid solution of carbon in face-centered cubic (FCC) iron.\n-   **Ferrite ($\\alpha$):** A solid solution of carbon in body-centered cubic (BCC) iron.\n-   **Cementite (Fe$_3$C):** A hard, brittle intermetallic compound of iron and carbon.\n-   **Pearlite:** The eutectoid microconstituent, a lamellar (layered) mixture of ferrite and cementite.\n-   **Ledeburite:** The eutectic microconstituent, a mixture of austenite and cementite formed from the liquid phase.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly contrasts the phase transformations for these two alloys?

Alloy A: The parent phase is liquid; the resulting microconstituent is Ledeburite.\n   Alloy B: The parent phases are Austenite and Ferrite; the resulting microconstituent is Pearlite.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must analyze the cooling process for each alloy and identify the phases present just before the specified invariant reaction and the resulting microstructure.\n\nFirst, let's analyze **Alloy A**, which has the eutectic composition of 4.3 wt% carbon.\nThe problem states this alloy is cooled from a high temperature where it is entirely liquid. The eutectic reaction is an invariant reaction where a liquid phase transforms into two solid phases upon cooling. The general form is $L \\rightarrow S_1 + S_2$. For the iron-carbon system, this specific reaction occurs at the eutectic temperature, $T_E = 1147^\\circ\\text{C}$, and the eutectic composition, 4.3 wt% C.\nThe reaction is:\n$$L(4.3 \\text{ wt\\% C}) \\xrightarrow{1147^\\circ\\text{C}} \\gamma(2.14 \\text{ wt\\% C}) + \\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}(6.7 \\text{ wt\\% C})$$\nThe parent phase is the phase that exists immediately before the transformation. For Alloy A, as it is cooled down to just above $1147^\\circ\\text{C}$, it remains entirely in the liquid phase. At exactly $1147^\\circ\\text{C}$, this liquid transforms. Therefore, the parent phase is liquid.\nThe microconstituent formed by this eutectic reaction is defined in the problem as Ledeburite, which is a mixture of austenite ($\\gamma$) and cementite (Fe$_3$C).\nSo, for Alloy A: Parent phase = Liquid; Resulting microconstituent = Ledeburite.\n\nNext, let's analyze **Alloy B**, which has the eutectoid composition of 0.76 wt% carbon.\nThis alloy is also cooled from a high temperature. As it cools, it first solidifies completely into a single solid phase, austenite ($\\gamma$). The eutectoid reaction is a solid-state invariant reaction where one solid phase transforms into two different solid phases upon cooling. The general form is $S_1 \\rightarrow S_2 + S_3$. For the iron-carbon system, this occurs at the eutectoid temperature, $T_{eutectoid} = 727^\\circ\\text{C}$, and the eutectoid composition, 0.76 wt% C.\nAs Alloy B cools and passes into the austenite phase field, it remains a single-phase austenite solid. When its temperature reaches just above $727^\\circ\\text{C}$, it is still 100% austenite. At exactly $727^\\circ\\text{C}$, this austenite transforms.\nThe reaction is:\n$$\\gamma(0.76 \\text{ wt\\% C}) \\xrightarrow{727^\\circ\\text{C}} \\alpha(0.022 \\text{ wt\\% C}) + \\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}(6.7 \\text{ wt\\% C})$$\nThe parent phase for this transformation is the solid phase that exists just before the reaction, which is austenite.\nThe microconstituent formed by this eutectoid reaction is a fine, lamellar mixture of ferrite ($\\alpha$) and cementite (Fe$_3$C), which is defined as Pearlite.\nSo, for Alloy B: Parent phase = Austenite; Resulting microconstituent = Pearlite.\n\nNow we compare our findings with the given options:\n-   **A. Alloy A: Parent phase is liquid; resulting microconstituent is Ledeburite. Alloy B: Parent phase is Austenite; resulting microconstituent is Pearlite.** This matches our analysis perfectly.\n-   B. This option incorrectly swaps the microconstituents. Pearlite is the eutectoid product, and Ledeburite is the eutectic product.\n-   C. This option incorrectly swaps the parent phases. The eutectic reaction involves a liquid parent, and the eutectoid reaction involves a solid parent (austenite).\n-   D. This option incorrectly identifies the parent phase for Alloy A. For a eutectic composition, there is only one parent phase (liquid). Two phases (liquid + solid) would be present just above the eutectic temperature for hypereutectic or hypoeutectic compositions, but not for the eutectic itself.\n-   E. This option incorrectly identifies the parent phase for Alloy B. For the eutectoid composition, the parent is single-phase austenite. Two phases (austenite + ferrite) would be present for a hypoeutectoid composition just above the eutectoid temperature.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1341275"}, {"introduction": "Moving from concepts to calculations, we can use the phase diagram as a quantitative tool.
