A researcher places a solid block of cryoform into an open beaker and begins to heat it gently. This experiment is conducted in a standard laboratory on Earth, where the atmospheric pressure is $1.00$ atm.\n\nAssuming cryoform is chemically stable and does not react with Earth's atmosphere, which of the following statements best describes the expected observation as the temperature of the sample is increased?\n\nA. The cryoform will first melt into a liquid and then begin to boil at a temperature above $195$ K.\n\nB. The cryoform will melt into a liquid at $195$ K but will not boil, only evaporate slowly.\n\nC. The cryoform will not undergo any phase transition and will remain a solid.\n\nD. The cryoform will transform directly from a solid into a gas without passing through a liquid phase.\n\nE. The cryoform will decompose into its constituent elements.", "solution": "We identify the triple point of cryoform at $(T_{t}, P_{t}) = (195 \\text{ K}, 2.25 \\text{ atm})$. By definition, the triple point is the unique $(T, P)$ at which solid, liquid, and gas phases coexist in equilibrium. For a pure substance, the liquid phase is only stable at pressures at or above the triple point pressure, i.e., for $P \\geq P_{t}$; for $P < P_{t}$, a stable liquid phase does not exist on the $P$-$T$ diagram.\n\nThe experiment is conducted in an open beaker, so the sample is at the external pressure $P_{\\text{ext}} = 1.00 \\text{ atm}$. Since $P_{\\text{ext}} < P_{t}$, the system lies entirely below the triple point pressure. At such a pressure, the accessible phase boundary upon heating is the solid-gas (sublimation) curve; there is no solid-liquid boundary to cross because the liquid phase is not thermodynamically stable at any temperature when $P < P_{t}$.\n\nFormally, along any phase boundary between phases $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the Clapeyron equation holds:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta S_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\Delta V_{\\alpha\\beta}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\alpha\\beta}}{T \\Delta V_{\\alpha\\beta}}.\n$$\nThe existence and location of these boundaries define whether phase transitions are possible at a given $P$. Since only the solid-gas boundary exists at $P_{\\text{ext}} < P_{t}$, heating at constant $P_{\\text{ext}}$ can only lead from solid to gas via sublimation once the sublimation curve temperature is reached.\n\nTherefore:\n- Melting at $T = 195 \\text{ K}$ requires $P = P_{t}$ and thus cannot occur at $P_{\\text{ext}} = 1.00 \\text{ atm}$.\n- Boiling requires a liquid phase, which is absent for $P < P_{t}$, so neither boiling nor melting can occur.\n- The chemically stable assumption rules out decomposition.\n\nConsequently, as temperature increases at $1.00 \\text{ atm}$, the solid transforms directly into gas (sublimation) without passing through a liquid phase.

Laboratory studies under controlled conditions have determined two key thermodynamic points for XNH: its triple point occurs at a pressure of $P_t = 0.12$ atm and a temperature of $T_t = 150$ K, and its critical point occurs at a pressure of $P_c = 85$ atm and a temperature of $T_c = 410$ K.\n\nA probe deployed to the planet's surface enters a stable, subterranean cavern where the ambient pressure is constant at $P_{cav} = 15$ atm.

Over a long period, the cavern slowly cools down to a final temperature of $T_{final} = 100$ K.
