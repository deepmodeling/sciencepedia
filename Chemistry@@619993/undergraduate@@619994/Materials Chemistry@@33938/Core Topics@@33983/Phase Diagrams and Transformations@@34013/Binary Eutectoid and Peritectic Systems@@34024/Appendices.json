The overall composition is $C_0 = 1.2$ wt% C. This is greater than the eutectoid composition of 0.76 wt% C, which means the alloy is a hypereutectoid steel. According to the iron-carbon phase diagram, for a hypereutectoid steel at a temperature just above the eutectoid temperature, the system consists of two phases in equilibrium: austenite ($\\gamma$) and cementite ($\\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}$).\n\nThe cementite present at this temperature is the proeutectoid cementite, as it formed from the parent austenite phase upon cooling before the eutectoid reaction could take place.\n\nTo find the mass fractions of the two phases, we use the lever rule. The lever rule relates the mass fractions of the phases to the overall composition of the alloy and the compositions of the individual phases. Let $W_{\\gamma}$ be the mass fraction of austenite and $W_{\\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}}$ be the mass fraction of cementite.\n\nThe compositions of the phases at this temperature are:\n- The composition of the austenite phase, $C_{\\gamma}$, is the maximum solubility of carbon in austenite at the eutectoid temperature, which is the eutectoid composition: $C_{\\gamma} = 0.76$ wt% C.\n- The composition of the cementite phase, $C_{\\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}}$, is given as a constant value: $C_{\\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}} = 6.7$ wt% C.\n- The overall composition of the alloy is $C_0 = 1.2$ wt% C.\n\nThe lever rule for the mass fraction of cementite ($W_{\\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}}$) is given by placing the fulcrum at the overall composition $C_0$ on a tie-line connecting the compositions of the two phases, $C_{\\gamma}$ and $C_{\\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}}$. The mass fraction of a phase is the length of the lever arm on the opposite side of the fulcrum, divided by the total length of the tie-line.\n\n$$W_{\\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}} = \\frac{C_0 - C_{\\gamma}}{C_{\\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}} - C_{\\gamma}}$$\n\nSince the cementite present at this temperature is entirely proeutectoid cementite, this calculation directly gives the desired quantity, $W_{\\text{proeutectoid Fe}_3\\text{C}}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$W_{\\text{proeutectoid Fe}_3\\text{C}} = \\frac{1.2 - 0.76}{6.7 - 0.76}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator and the denominator:\nNumerator: $1.2 - 0.76 = 0.44$\nDenominator: $6.7 - 0.76 = 5.94$\n\nNow, perform the division:\n$$W_{\\text{proeutectoid Fe}_3\\text{C}} = \\frac{0.44}{5.94} \\approx 0.074074074...$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first non-zero digit is 7, so the three significant figures are 7, 4, and 0. The next digit is 7, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the last significant figure (0) to 1.\n\n$$W_{\\text{proeutectoid Fe}_3\\text{C}} \\approx 0.0741$$\n\nThus, the mass fraction of proeutectoid cementite is 0.0741.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0741}$$", "id": "1285417"}, {"introduction": "Moving from simple analysis to materials design is a critical step in engineering.
