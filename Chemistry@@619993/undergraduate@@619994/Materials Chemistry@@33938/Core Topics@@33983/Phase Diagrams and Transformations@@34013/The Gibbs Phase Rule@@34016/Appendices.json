The model considers a simplified two-component system consisting of water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) and a single dissolved salt. At a certain depth, corresponding to a unique combination of pressure and temperature, the model predicts the existence of a special equilibrium state known as a \"quadruple point.\" At this specific point, the system is thermodynamically invariant, meaning that neither the temperature nor the pressure can be independently changed without causing one or more of the coexisting phases to disappear. Based on the Gibbs phase rule, how many distinct phases must be in equilibrium at this quadruple point?", "solution": "We apply the Gibbs phase rule for a nonreactive system with variable temperature and pressure:\n$$F = C - P + 2,$$\nwhere $F$ is the number of degrees of freedom, $C$ is the number of components, and $P$ is the number of coexisting phases.\n\nIn the given system, there are $C=2$ components (water and one salt). A “thermodynamically invariant” point means there are no degrees of freedom, so\n$$F=0.$$\nSubstituting into the Gibbs phase rule gives\n$$0 = 2 - P + 2 = 4 - P,$$\nwhich yields\n$$P = 4.$$\n\nTherefore, four distinct phases must be in equilibrium at the quadruple point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1863992"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple calculations, this practice challenges you to think critically about the definition of a \"component\" ($C$). By analyzing what happens when an inert, insoluble gas is added to a water-vapor equilibrium, you can explore how the system's degrees of freedom are affected [@problem_id:1340689]. This scenario is essential for learning that a component is any chemically independent constituent whose concentration can be varied, a crucial distinction for accurately applying the phase rule to mixed systems.", "problem": "A sealed, thermally conductive piston-cylinder apparatus contains pure liquid water in equilibrium with its vapor. The temperature and pressure of the system are initially allowed to stabilize. An external operator then injects a quantity of helium gas into the cylinder through a valve. The helium gas is treated as ideal and is completely insoluble in liquid water. The system is then allowed to reach a new state of equilibrium while maintaining the same temperature as the initial state.\n\nThe number of independent intensive variables (such as temperature, pressure, and mole fraction) that can be varied without changing the number of phases present is known as the number of degrees of freedom. How does the addition of helium gas affect the degrees of freedom of the system and the relationship between the intensive variables?\n\nA. The degrees of freedom increase. Consequently, the total pressure in the cylinder is no longer solely determined by the temperature.\n\nB. The degrees of freedom decrease. Consequently, the system can only exist at a single, unique combination of temperature and pressure.\n\nC. The degrees of freedom remain unchanged because helium is an inert gas and does not react with water.\n\nD. The degrees of freedom increase. However, the total pressure in the cylinder is still solely determined by the temperature, just as in the pure water system.\n\nE. The degrees of freedom decrease because the problem states the system reaches a new equilibrium at the same temperature, which removes one degree of freedom.", "solution": "We use the Gibbs phase rule for nonreactive systems,\n$$\nF = C - P + 2 - r,\n$$\nwith $r=0$ (no reactions). Here $C$ is the number of components and $P$ is the number of phases.\n\nInitial system (pure water, liquid in equilibrium with its vapor): $C=1$ and $P=2$, hence\n$$\nF_{\\text{initial}} = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1.\n$$\nThis means a single intensive variable (e.g., $T$) fixes the other (e.g., $P$), and indeed the equilibrium condition is the saturation relation\n$$\nP = P_{\\text{sat}}(T).\n$$\n\nAfter adding helium (ideal, inert, insoluble in liquid water), the system has two phases: a liquid phase containing only $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ and a gas phase that is a mixture of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ and He. The number of components is now $C=2$ (water and helium), and the number of phases remains $P=2$, so\n$$\nF_{\\text{with He}} = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2.\n$$\nThus the degrees of freedom increase from $1$ to $2$.\n\nNext, we determine whether the total pressure remains solely a function of temperature. At vapor–liquid equilibrium for water in the presence of an inert ideal gas, the equilibrium condition is equality of fugacities of water in the two phases:\n$$\nf_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}^{(l)}(T,P,x_{l}=1) = f_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}^{(v)}(T,P,y_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}).\n$$\nFor a pure, incompressible liquid at low to moderate pressures, $f_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}^{(l)}(T,P)$ equals the saturation fugacity at the same $T$, which we denote by $f_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}^{\\text{sat}}(T)$. For an ideal gas mixture, the vapor-phase fugacity of water is\n$$\nf_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}^{(v)} = y_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} P,\n$$\nwith $y_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$ the mole fraction of water in the gas and $P$ the total pressure.

The total pressure is the sum of partial pressures,\n$$\nP = P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} + P_{\\mathrm{He}} = P_{\\text{sat}}(T) + P_{\\mathrm{He}}.\n$$\nBecause $P_{\\mathrm{He}}$ depends on the helium amount and system volume (via the ideal gas law) and is independent of $P_{\\text{sat}}(T)$, the total pressure $P$ is no longer solely determined by $T$. Instead, at fixed $T$, one can vary $P$ by varying the helium content while maintaining two phases. This is precisely the manifestation of the increased degrees of freedom from $1$ to $2$.\n\nTherefore, the addition of helium increases the degrees of freedom, and the total pressure is no longer solely determined by the temperature; only the water partial pressure remains tied to $T$ through $P_{\\text{sat}}(T)$.
