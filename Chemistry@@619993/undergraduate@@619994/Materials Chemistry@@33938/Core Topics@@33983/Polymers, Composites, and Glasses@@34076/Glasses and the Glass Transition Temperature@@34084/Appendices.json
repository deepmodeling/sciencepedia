It represents the temperature at which the material undergoes a reversible transition from a hard, rigid, and often brittle \"glassy\" state to a more flexible, viscous, or \"rubbery\" state.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the polymer's behavior at room temperature.\nThe problem states that at room temperature, defined as $T_{room} = 25 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the polymer container is \"rigid and shatters easily.\" This is characteristic of the glassy state. For a polymer to be in its glassy state, its temperature must be below its glass transition temperature. Therefore, we can infer that:\n$T_{room}  T_g$\n$25 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}  T_g$\n\nStep 2: Analyze the polymer's behavior at the temperature of boiling water.\nThe problem states that when filled with boiling water at $T_{boiling} = 100 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the container becomes \"soft and pliable.\" This is characteristic of the rubbery state. For a polymer to be in its rubbery state, its temperature must be above its glass transition temperature. Therefore, we can infer that:\n$T_{boiling} > T_g$\n$100 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C} > T_g$\n\nStep 3: Combine the inferences to establish a range for $T_g$.\nFrom Step 1, we have $T_g > 25 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.\nFrom Step 2, we have $T_g  100 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.\nCombining these two inequalities gives us the range for the glass transition temperature:\n$25 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}  T_g  100 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$\n\nStep 4: Compare the derived range with the given options.\nA. $T_g  25 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$: This is incorrect.

If this were true, the material would remain in its rigid, glassy state even when filled with boiling water.\nC. The glass transition temperature is exactly $100 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$: This is too specific and incorrect. The transition to the rubbery state occurs for temperatures *above* $T_g$. The observation that it is soft at $100 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ only implies $T_g  100 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, not that it equals it.\nD. $25 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}  T_g  100 \\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$: This range is consistent with both observations.

The glass transition temperature cannot be determined from this qualitative information: This is incorrect.

This practice explores the fundamental molecular reason for this difference, focusing on the concept of tacticity. By comparing atactic and isotactic polystyrene, you will understand how the regularity of the polymer chain's structure dictates its ability to pack into an ordered crystal lattice, a key principle governing polymer behavior. [@problem_id:1302267]", "problem": "Polystyrene is a widely used synthetic polymer. Its properties can be dramatically altered by controlling the stereochemistry of the polymer chain, specifically its tacticity—the spatial arrangement of the phenyl pendant groups relative to the polymer backbone. Two common forms are atactic polystyrene and isotactic polystyrene.\n\nExperimentally, it is observed that atactic polystyrene is a fully amorphous, glassy solid at room temperature. When heated, it does not have a sharp melting point ($T_m$) but does exhibit a glass transition temperature ($T_g$) at approximately $100\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. In contrast, isotactic polystyrene is a semi-crystalline solid that shows both a glass transition temperature ($T_g$) and a distinct, sharp melting point ($T_m$) at approximately $240\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this difference in thermal behavior?\n\nA. The regular, repeating arrangement of phenyl groups in isotactic polystyrene allows polymer chains to pack together in an ordered, crystalline lattice. The random arrangement in atactic polystyrene prevents such packing, leading to a disordered amorphous structure.\n\nB. The average molecular weight of atactic polystyrene is significantly lower than that of isotactic polystyrene, and a lower molecular weight prevents the formation of crystalline domains.\n\nC. The intermolecular van der Waals forces between the phenyl rings are intrinsically weaker in atactic polystyrene compared to isotactic polystyrene, preventing the chains from holding together in a crystal.\n\nD. The carbon-carbon single bonds in the polymer backbone of atactic polystyrene have a higher degree of rotational freedom than those in isotactic polystyrene, leading to a more disordered state.\n\nE. Atactic polystyrene is always synthesized under conditions that kinetically trap the polymer in a disordered state, whereas isotactic polystyrene is synthesized in a way that allows it to reach its thermodynamically favored crystalline state.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the fundamental thermodynamic distinction between melting and the glass transition in polymers. A sharp melting temperature $T_m$ is the signature of a first-order transition between a crystalline solid and a liquid, characterized by a latent heat $\\Delta H_m$ and the equality of Gibbs free energies at the transition, $G_{\\text{cryst}}(T_m) = G_{\\text{melt}}(T_m)$, consistent with $\\Delta G_m = \\Delta H_m - T_m\\Delta S_m = 0$. By contrast, the glass transition at $T_g$ is a kinetic phenomenon associated with the freezing or unfreezing of segmental motions in the amorphous state and is accompanied by a change in heat capacity rather than a latent heat.\n\nWhether a polymer exhibits a crystalline phase hinges on its ability to pack into an ordered, periodic lattice; this requires sufficient stereochemical regularity along the chain to achieve long-range order. For polystyrene, the tacticity—the spatial arrangement of pendant phenyl groups relative to the backbone—controls this regularity. In isotactic polystyrene, the phenyl groups are arranged in a regular, repeating manner along the chain (all on the same side in the same stereochemical sense), enabling chains to adopt conformations that pack efficiently into an ordered, crystalline lattice. This long-range order produces a distinct crystalline phase and, consequently, a sharp $T_m$ when the crystalline free energy becomes equal to that of the melt.\n\nIn atactic polystyrene, the positions of the phenyl groups are random along the chain, destroying the periodicity required for translational symmetry and preventing the formation of extended crystalline domains. Without such a crystalline phase, there is no first-order crystal-to-melt transition and thus no sharp $T_m$. Instead, atactic polystyrene remains amorphous and exhibits only a $T_g$ associated with the onset of segmental mobility.\n\nWe now evaluate the given options in light of these principles:\n- Option A correctly identifies the stereochemical regularity of isotactic polystyrene as the enabling factor for crystalline packing and the random arrangement in atactic polystyrene as the cause of its amorphous character. This directly explains the presence of $T_m$ in isotactic polystyrene and its absence in atactic polystyrene.\n- Option B attributes the difference to molecular weight, which is not fundamental here; both atactic and isotactic polystyrenes can be synthesized at comparable high molecular weights, yet only the isotactic form consistently crystallizes due to stereoregularity.\n- Option C claims intrinsically weaker van der Waals forces in atactic polystyrene; however, the chemical composition and local interaction types are the same. The difference lies in packing efficiency imposed by tacticity, not in intrinsic interaction strength.\n- Option D suggests higher rotational freedom in the atactic backbone; the backbone chemistry and intrinsic torsional potentials do not fundamentally differ by tacticity. The key difference is the ability to achieve long-range order, not a distinct backbone rotational barrier.\n- Option E frames the difference as purely kinetic due to synthesis conditions. While synthesis conditions control tacticity, the observed thermal behavior is a thermodynamic consequence of the resulting microstructure: atactic microstructure lacks the symmetry to form an extended crystalline phase even under annealing, whereas isotactic can crystallize.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is the stereoregularity-enabled crystallinity described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1302267"}, {"introduction": "The practical importance of the glass transition temperature extends to the time-dependent behavior of polymers, such as stress relaxation.
