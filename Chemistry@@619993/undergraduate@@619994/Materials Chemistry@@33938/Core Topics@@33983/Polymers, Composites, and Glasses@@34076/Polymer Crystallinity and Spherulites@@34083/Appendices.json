This problem explores how we can purposefully modify this microstructure through a thermal processing step called annealing.

This conceptual exercise challenges you to apply principles of polymer thermodynamics to predict how annealing refines the crystalline architecture, a key skill in materials engineering for tailoring performance [@problem_id:1325860].", "problem": "A materials engineer is working with a high-performance semi-crystalline thermoplastic, \"Polymer X\". The polymer has a glass transition temperature ($T_g$) of 150 °C and an equilibrium melting temperature ($T_m$) of 330 °C. To prepare a sample for mechanical testing, the engineer first melts the polymer completely and then rapidly quenches it to room temperature. This process results in a material with a certain initial percent crystallinity and a distribution of crystalline lamellar thicknesses.\n\nThe engineer then performs an annealing heat treatment by holding the quenched sample at a constant temperature, $T_A = 300$ °C, for several hours before cooling it back down. This annealing step is designed to alter the microstructure and, consequently, the mechanical properties of the polymer.\n\nBased on the principles of polymer physics, what are the expected changes to the average percent crystallinity and the average thickness of the crystalline lamellae as a result of this annealing process, when compared to the initial quenched state?\n\nA.

The thermodynamic driving force per unit volume for crystallization at temperature $T$ is approximately\n$$\n\\Delta g_v(T)\\approx \\Delta h_f \\frac{T_m-T}{T_m},\n$$\nso at $T=T_A$ with $\\Delta T\\equiv T_m-T_A>0$, there is a positive driving force for crystallization.\n\nStarting from a quenched state, the initial crystallinity $X_0$ is low and lamellae are thin because the large undercooling during quench favors many nuclei and small lamellar thickness. Under isothermal annealing at $T_A$, the time evolution of crystallinity is described by Avrami-type kinetics. For an initially partially crystallized material, a common form is\n$$\nX(t)=X_{\\infty}-\\left(X_{\\infty}-X_0\\right)\\exp\\left(-K t^{n}\\right),\n$$\nwith $K>0$ at $T_A$ and $n>0$. Thus $X(t)$ increases monotonically from $X_0$ toward the isothermal asymptote $X_{\\infty}$ at $T_A$, implying an increase in the average crystallinity relative to the quenched state.\n\nFor the lamellar thickness, the Gibbs–Thomson relation for a lamella of thickness $l$ gives the thickness-dependent melting temperature\n$$\nT_m(l)=T_m\\left(1-\\frac{2\\sigma_e}{\\Delta h_f \\rho_c\\, l}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_e$ is the fold surface free energy, $\\rho_c$ is the crystal density, and $\\Delta h_f$ is the enthalpy of fusion per unit mass. At $T_A$, lamellae with $T_m(l)<T_A$ (i.e., lamellae that are too thin) are unstable and tend to melt, and the released chains recrystallize onto thicker lamellae. Lauritzen–Hoffman theory gives the preferred (equilibrium) lamellar thickness at temperature $T_A$ as\n$$\nl^{*}(T_A)=\\frac{2\\sigma_e\\, T_m}{\\Delta h_f \\rho_c\\,(T_m-T_A)}=\\frac{2\\sigma_e\\, T_m}{\\Delta h_f \\rho_c\\, \\Delta T},\n$$\nwhich increases as $\\Delta T$ decreases. Since the quenched lamellae formed at very large undercooling are thin, annealing at $T_A$ with smaller $\\Delta T$ drives melting–recrystallization (and surface transport) toward larger $l$, thereby increasing the average lamellar thickness.\n\nTherefore, annealing at $T_A=300\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ relative to the initial quenched state leads to:\n- an increase in average crystallinity due to secondary crystallization and perfection below $T_m$;\n- an increase in average lamellar thickness due to Gibbs–Thomson-driven melting–recrystallization toward $l^{*}(T_A)$.\n\nHence the correct choice is that both percent crystallinity and average lamellar thickness increase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1325860"}]}
