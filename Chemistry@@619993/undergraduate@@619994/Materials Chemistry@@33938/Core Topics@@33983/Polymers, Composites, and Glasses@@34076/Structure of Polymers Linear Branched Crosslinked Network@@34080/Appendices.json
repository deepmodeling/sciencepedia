This practice explores the most dramatic distinction: that between linear and crosslinked polymers. By analyzing a simple solubility test, you will learn how the presence or absence of covalent bonds between chains determines whether a polymer dissolves into a solution or merely swells into a gel, a key principle used in polymer identification and characterization [@problem_id:1338366].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with identifying two unlabeled polymer samples, Sample Alpha and Sample Beta. Both samples are white powders and are known to be polystyrene. However, one sample is linear polystyrene, consisting of long, individual chains of repeating styrene units. The other sample is a crosslinked polystyrene network, where the polystyrene chains are covalently bonded to each other via divinylbenzene crosslinking agents.\n\nThe student performs a simple solubility test. They place 1 gram of Sample Alpha into a beaker containing 100 mL of toluene (a known good solvent for polystyrene) and 1 gram of Sample Beta into a separate, identical beaker with 100 mL of toluene. Both beakers are sealed and left on a magnetic stirrer for 24 hours at room temperature to ensure maximum interaction with the solvent.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the student observes the contents of the beakers. In the beaker with Sample Alpha, the powder has completely vanished, resulting in a clear, viscous, homogeneous liquid. In the beaker with Sample Beta, the original powder is gone, but it has been replaced by a single, translucent, swollen, gelatinous mass that occupies a significant portion of the beaker's volume.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following conclusions is correct?\n\nA. Sample Alpha is the crosslinked polymer and Sample Beta is the linear polymer.\n\nB. Sample Alpha is the linear polymer and Sample Beta is the crosslinked polymer.\n\nC. Both samples are linear, but Sample Alpha has a much lower molecular weight than Sample Beta.\n\nD. Both samples are crosslinked, but Sample Beta has a much higher crosslink density than Sample Alpha.\n\nE. The experiment is inconclusive because temperature also affects solubility.", "solution": "We analyze dissolution and swelling of polymers in solvents using polymer solution thermodynamics.\n\nFor a linear polymer in a good solvent, the Gibbs free energy of mixing is negative, enabling dissolution. Within Flory-Huggins theory, a good solvent satisfies the interaction parameter condition $\\chi < \\frac{1}{2}$, which for polystyrene in toluene at room temperature is well established. A linear polymer has no network elasticity; equivalently, the effective network chain density is $\\nu_{e}=0$. Therefore, there is no elastic restoring force opposing mixing, and the polymer dissolves to form a homogeneous viscous solution. Observation: Sample Alpha disappears and yields a clear, viscous, homogeneous liquid, consistent with complete dissolution of a linear polystyrene in a good solvent.\n\nFor a crosslinked polymer network, the material is insoluble because it forms a single macromolecule of effectively infinite molar mass. The equilibrium state in a good solvent is swelling, governed by Flory-Rehner theory through the balance\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\text{mix}}(\\phi,\\chi) + \\Pi_{\\text{el}}(\\phi,\\nu_{e}) = 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\Pi_{\\text{mix}}$ is the osmotic pressure from mixing (favoring swelling) and $\\Pi_{\\text{el}}$ is the elastic retractive pressure due to the network (opposing swelling), with $\\nu_{e} > 0$. This balance yields a finite swollen gel, not dissolution. Observation: Sample Beta becomes a single translucent, swollen, gelatinous mass occupying significant volume, exactly the behavior of a crosslinked polystyrene network swollen by toluene.\n\nThese observations map directly:\n- Sample Alpha dissolves completely in toluene, indicating a linear polymer in a good solvent.\n- Sample Beta forms a swollen gel, indicating a crosslinked network that is insoluble but swellable.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the dissolving sample (Alpha) cannot be crosslinked.\n- B is correct: Alpha is linear, Beta is crosslinked.\n- C is incorrect: a linear, higher-molar-mass sample in a good solvent would still dissolve (albeit more viscously), not form a single gel piece.\n- D is incorrect: a crosslinked polymer would not fully disappear into a clear homogeneous solution; even at low crosslink density it remains insoluble.\n- E is incorrect: while temperature affects $\\chi$, toluene at room temperature is a known good solvent for polystyrene, and the starkly different outcomes are conclusive.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that Sample Alpha is the linear polymer and Sample Beta is the crosslinked polymer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1338366"}, {"introduction": "While polymers may share the same chemical composition and total mass, their three-dimensional shape, or architecture, can significantly alter their behavior. This exercise delves into the difference between linear and branched polymers by quantifying their size in solution.

Both samples are dissolved in toluene (a good solvent) at the same concentration and temperature.\n\nThe effective size of a polymer coil in solution can be quantified by its radius of gyration, $R_g$. For a given total molar mass, the architectural difference between a star-branched and a linear polymer leads to a difference in their radii of gyration. This is described by the branching factor, $g$, defined by the relation:\n$$\n(R_{g,star})^2 = g \\cdot (R_{g,linear})^2\n$$\nwhere $R_{g,star}$ and $R_{g,linear}$ are the radii of gyration for the star and linear polymers, respectively.
