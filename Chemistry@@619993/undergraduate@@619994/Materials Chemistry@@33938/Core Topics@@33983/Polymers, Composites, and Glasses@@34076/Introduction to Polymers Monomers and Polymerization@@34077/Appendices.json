The goal is to achieve a final polymer with a specific number-average molecular weight, $M_{n,\\text{final}} = 36000 \\, \\text{g/mol}$. Two synthesis protocols, Protocol X and Protocol Y, are being evaluated.\n\nProtocol X employs a living polymerization mechanism. In an ideal living polymerization, termination and chain transfer reactions are absent. As a result, the number-average molecular weight of the polymer, $M_{n,X}$, grows in direct proportion to the fractional monomer conversion, $p$. The polymer only reaches the desired final molecular weight, $M_{n,\\text{final}}$, at complete conversion ($p=1.0$).\n\nProtocol Y follows a conventional chain-growth polymerization mechanism. A key characteristic of this mechanism is that high molecular weight polymer is generated almost immediately after initiation.

We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n$$M_{n,X}(p) = k \\cdot p$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality and $M_{n,X}(p)$ is the number-average molecular weight at conversion $p$.\n\nWe are given that at full conversion, $p=1.0$, the molecular weight reaches its final target value, $M_{n,X}(1.0) = M_{n,\\text{final}}$. We can use this information to find the constant $k$:\n$$M_{n,\\text{final}} = k \\cdot (1.0)$$\n$$k = M_{n,\\text{final}}$$\n\nTherefore, the relationship for the number-average molecular weight in Protocol X as a function of conversion is:\n$$M_{n,X}(p) = M_{n,\\text{final}} \\cdot p$$\n\nThe problem asks for this value at a specific conversion of $p=0.40$. Substituting this value into the equation:\n$$M_{n,X}(0.40) = M_{n,\\text{final}} \\cdot 0.40$$\nNote that the given values for $M_0$ and $M_{n,\\text{final}}$ are consistent with the scenario but are not needed to establish this relationship.\n\nNext, let's analyze Protocol Y, the conventional chain-growth polymerization.\nThe problem states that for this protocol, the number-average molecular weight of the polymer being formed, $M_{n,Y}$, is essentially constant for all levels of conversion and is equal to the target value, $M_{n,\\text{final}}$.\nThis means that regardless of the conversion $p$ (as long as $p>0$), the polymer that is isolated will have a number-average molecular weight of $M_{n,\\text{final}}$.\nSo, at the specific conversion $p=0.40$, the molecular weight of the polymer from Protocol Y is:\n$$M_{n,Y}(0.40) = M_{n,\\text{final}}$$\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the ratio $\\frac{M_{n,X}}{M_{n,Y}}$ at $p=0.40$.\n$$\\frac{M_{n,X}(0.40)}{M_{n,Y}(0.40)} = \\frac{M_{n,\\text{final}} \\cdot 0.40}{M_{n,\\text{final}}}$$\n\nThe term $M_{n,\\text{final}}$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\\frac{M_{n,X}}{M_{n,Y}} = 0.40$$\n\nThus, the ratio of the number-average molecular weights at 40% conversion is 0.40.
