The Melt Flow Index is an empirical measure of the mass of polymer that flows through a capillary die of a specific diameter and length in 10 minutes under a prescribed load and temperature. A high MFI value means the polymer flows easily, indicating a low melt viscosity. Conversely, a low MFI value means the polymer resists flow, indicating a high melt viscosity.\n\nMelt viscosity is directly related to the average molecular weight of the polymer chains. Longer polymer chains (higher molecular weight) are more entangled, leading to higher resistance to flow (high viscosity). Shorter chains (lower molecular weight) are less entangled and can slide past each other more easily, resulting in lower viscosity.\n\nTherefore, we can establish the following key relationships:\n- **High MFI** $\\implies$ Low melt viscosity $\\implies$ Low average molecular weight.\n- **Low MFI** $\\implies$ High melt viscosity $\\implies$ High average molecular weight.\n\nAnother crucial property for this application is **melt strength**. Melt strength is the ability of the molten polymer to resist stretching or deformation under its own weight. It is directly related to molecular weight and viscosity. A polymer with a high molecular weight and high melt viscosity will exhibit high melt strength.\n\nNow, let's analyze the specific manufacturing process: extrusion blow molding of a **large** drum.\n1. In this process, a hollow tube of molten polymer, called a parison, is extruded downwards from a die.\n2. After the parison reaches the desired length, a two-part mold closes around it.\n3. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it against the cold walls of the mold, where it solidifies into the final shape.\n\nFor a **large** drum, the parison must be long and consequently heavy. As it hangs vertically from the die before the mold closes, it is subjected to the force of gravity. A polymer with low melt strength would not be able to support its own weight; the parison would sag and stretch uncontrollably. This phenomenon, known as \"parison sag,\" results in a product with a very thin top section and a thick, accumulated mass at the bottom, or it may even cause the parison to tear.\n\nTo prevent excessive parison sag, the material must have sufficient **melt strength**. This requires a polymer with a high melt viscosity and a high average molecular weight. According to our established relationships, this corresponds to a material with a **low MFI**.\n\nLet's compare the two samples:\n- **Sample A:** MFI = 0.5 g/10 min (Low MFI)\n- **Sample B:** MFI = 20 g/10 min (High MFI)\n\nSample A, with its significantly lower MFI, will have a much higher molecular weight, higher melt viscosity, and therefore, higher melt strength than Sample B. This high melt strength is essential to support the weight of the large parison and ensure a uniform wall thickness in the final drum. Therefore, Sample A is the correct choice.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n- **A. Sample A, because its low MFI indicates high melt strength, which is necessary to prevent the extruded parison (the molten tube) from sagging excessively under its own weight before the mold closes.** This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The low MFI correctly implies high melt strength, which is the critical property needed to combat parison sag in this large-part application.\n- **B. Sample B, because its high MFI indicates high fluidity, which allows the material to fill the large mold more quickly and easily.** This is incorrect. While high fluidity (low viscosity) is desirable in processes like injection molding for intricate parts, in extrusion blow molding for large parts, the melt strength to prevent sag is far more critical. The high fluidity of Sample B would lead to catastrophic parison sag.\n- **C. Sample A, because its low MFI indicates low melt viscosity, which reduces the energy required to extrude the parison.** This states the correct material (Sample A) but for the wrong reason. A low MFI indicates *high* melt viscosity, not low. While higher viscosity does require more energy for extrusion, it is a necessary trade-off to achieve the required melt strength.\n- **D. Sample B, because its high MFI indicates a higher molecular weight, leading to a stronger final product.** This is incorrect on two counts. First, a high MFI indicates a *lower* molecular weight. Second, while Sample A (the higher molecular weight polymer) would likely lead to a stronger final product in terms of properties like impact resistance, the reasoning provided for choosing Sample B is fundamentally flawed.\n\nTherefore, the only correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1328247"}, {"introduction": "The single-screw extruder is a cornerstone of the polymer industry, and mastering its operation is essential. This exercise investigates the direct consequences of altering a primary control parameter: the screw's rotational speed. You will explore the fundamental physics governing material transport and heat generation, specifically the balance between drag flow and the powerful effect of viscous dissipation (shear heating), to understand how machine settings dictate both production rate and the final melt temperature. [@problem_id:1328248]", "problem": "A materials engineer is operating a large-scale, single-screw extruder to produce a continuous cylindrical rod of a thermoplastic polymer. The extruder system consists of a heated barrel, a rotating screw within the barrel that conveys and melts the polymer, a hopper for feeding raw polymer pellets, and a circular die at the end that shapes the final extrudate. The engineer's goal is to understand the process dynamics. Starting from a stable operating condition, the engineer decides to significantly increase the screw's rotational speed, $N$, while keeping all other parameters, such as the barrel heater temperatures and the die geometry, fixed.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary effects of increasing the screw rotation speed on the material output rate (mass per unit time) and the average temperature of the polymer melt as it exits the die?\n\nA. The output rate increases due to enhanced drag flow from the rotating screw. The melt temperature also increases, primarily due to greater viscous heat generation (shear heating) from the higher shear rates imposed on the polymer.\n\nB. The output rate increases due to the enhanced drag flow. However, the melt temperature decreases because the polymer's reduced residence time in the barrel limits the total heat absorbed from the external barrel heaters.\n\nC. The output rate decreases because the higher speed causes inefficient melting and conveying, leading to solid polymer particles plugging the flow channel. The melt temperature increases due to the excessive friction from this plugging effect.\n\nD. The output rate remains relatively constant, as it is primarily determined by the pressure required to push the melt through the fixed die geometry. The melt temperature increases because the motor driving the screw works harder.\n\nE. The output rate increases because the increased rotational speed builds up more pressure at the die, forcing the material out faster. The melt temperature remains constant because the increased viscous heating is perfectly canceled by the cooling effect of the reduced residence time.", "solution": "The problem asks for the primary effects of increasing the screw rotation speed in a single-screw extruder on two key process variables: material output rate and melt temperature. We must analyze the underlying physical principles governing material transport and heat generation within the extruder.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the effect on Material Output Rate.**\nThe movement of the polymer melt along the extruder barrel is governed by two main flow components: drag flow and pressure flow.\n- **Drag Flow ($Q_d$)**: This is the forward flow of the material caused by the shearing action of the rotating screw. The viscous polymer melt adheres to the moving screw surface and is \"dragged\" towards the die. The rate of drag flow is directly proportional to the screw's rotational speed, $N$. Thus, as $N$ increases, $Q_d$ increases.\n- **Pressure Flow ($Q_p$)**: As the melt is forced towards the die, a pressure gradient develops, which opposes the forward motion. This results in a backward \"leakage\" flow over the screw flights, known as pressure flow. This flow component opposes the drag flow.\n\nThe net output rate, $Q$, is the difference between these two: $Q = Q_d - Q_p$.\nWhen the screw speed $N$ is increased, the drag flow component $Q_d$ increases significantly. While the pressure profile may also adjust, the increase in drag flow is the dominant effect. Therefore, the overall material output rate, or throughput, increases. This analysis allows us to eliminate options C and D, which suggest a decreasing or constant output rate.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect on Melt Temperature.**\nThe temperature of the polymer melt is determined by a balance between heat added and heat removed. There are two primary sources of heat input in an extruder:\n- **Conducted Heat**: Heat is conducted from the external heaters on the barrel wall to the polymer.\n- **Viscous Dissipation (Shear Heating)**: This is internal heat generation. As the screw rotates, it performs mechanical work on the highly viscous polymer melt. This work is dissipated as thermal energy due to internal friction (viscous forces) within the melt. The power dissipated per unit volume due to this effect is proportional to the viscosity multiplied by the square of the shear rate ($\\eta \\dot{\\gamma}^2$).\n\nThe shear rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}$, is directly proportional to the screw's surface velocity, which in turn is directly proportional to the rotational speed, $N$. Therefore, the rate of viscous heat generation is approximately proportional to $N^2$. This means that doubling the screw speed can quadruple the rate of internal heat generation.\n\nConversely, increasing the screw speed increases the output rate, which means the polymer spends less time inside the barrel (reduced residence time). This reduced time would limit the amount of heat the polymer can absorb from the external heaters.\n\nHowever, the dependence of viscous heating on the square of the screw speed ($N^2$) is a very powerful effect. For most industrial extruders, especially at higher speeds, the heat generated by viscous dissipation far outweighs the reduced heat transfer from the barrel due to shorter residence time. Consequently, an increase in screw speed leads to a significant increase in the final melt temperature.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the analysis.**\n- **A. The output rate increases due to enhanced drag flow... The melt temperature also increases, primarily due to greater viscous heat generation...** This statement correctly identifies both the cause for the increased output rate (drag flow) and the primary cause for the increased temperature (viscous/shear heating). This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n- **B. ...the melt temperature decreases because the polymer's reduced residence time...** This is a common misconception. It correctly identifies the residence time effect but fails to account for the dominant contribution of viscous heating, which causes the temperature to rise, not fall.\n- **C. The output rate decreases because...plugging...** This describes a potential process instability (surging) or a poorly designed process, not the fundamental and primary effect of increasing screw speed in a stable system.\n- **D. The output rate remains relatively constant...** This is incorrect, as the output is strongly dependent on screw speed via drag flow. The reason given for the temperature increase (\"motor works harder\") is a consequence, not the direct physical mechanism of heat generation within the polymer itself.\n- **E. ...rate increases because...pressure...temperature remains constant...** The primary driver for flow is drag, not pressure buildup (pressure opposes flow). The claim of a perfect cancellation between heating and cooling effects is highly unlikely and not the general principle.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the most accurate and complete physical description of the events.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1328248"}, {"introduction": "A perfectly designed part can fail if the manufacturing process introduces weaknesses, and in injection molding, weld lines are a primary concern.

When the front encounters the central hole, the hole acts as an internal obstacle, creating a “shadow” region downstream. By symmetry about $y=\\frac{W}{2}$, the incoming flow splits into two equal branches that go around the hole above and below the centerline and then reconverge on the same centerline downstream of the hole. In injection molding, a weld (or knit) line forms where two separately advancing melt fronts meet and fuse. With the hole centered on the symmetry axis and the gate on that same axis, the first meeting point of the two fronts that passed around the hole must lie on the longitudinal centerline at the point diametrically opposite the gate with respect to the hole. That point is the edge of the hole furthest from the gate. As filling proceeds, the locus of meeting continues downstream along the same centerline toward the far short edge, generating a line segment aligned with the longitudinal axis.\n\nTherefore, the most prominent weld line is expected to be a line segment along the longitudinal centerline beginning at the downstream edge of the hole (the edge furthest from the gate) and extending toward the far short edge.
