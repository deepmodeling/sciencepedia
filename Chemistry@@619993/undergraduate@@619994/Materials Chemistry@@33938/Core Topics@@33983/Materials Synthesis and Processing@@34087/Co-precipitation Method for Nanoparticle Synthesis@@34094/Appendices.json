Let's first determine the molar ratio of the metal cations in the target compound.\n\nThe chemical formula for the nickel-zinc ferrite is given as $Ni_{0.5}Zn_{0.5}Fe_2O_4$. This formula represents the relative number of atoms of each element in one formula unit of the compound. From this formula, we can directly read the stoichiometric ratio of the metal atoms (which become cations in the structure).\n\nFor one formula unit of $Ni_{0.5}Zn_{0.5}Fe_2O_4$, there are:\n- 0.5 parts of Nickel (Ni)\n- 0.5 parts of Zinc (Zn)\n- 2 parts of Iron (Fe)\n\nThus, the molar ratio of the metal cations in the final product is $Ni : Zn : Fe = 0.5 : 0.5 : 2$.\n\nThe precursor salts are $NiCl_2$, $ZnCl_2$, and $FeCl_3$. Each formula unit of these salts provides one metal cation:\n- One mole of $NiCl_2$ provides one mole of $Ni^{2+}$ ions.\n- One mole of $ZnCl_2$ provides one mole of $Zn^{2+}$ ions.\n- One mole of $FeCl_3$ provides one mole of $Fe^{3+}$ ions.\n\nSince the problem assumes an ideal co-precipitation where the cation ratio is preserved from the precursor solution to the final product, the molar ratio of the precursor salts must be the same as the molar ratio of the metal cations in the target compound.\n\nTherefore, the required molar ratio of the precursor salts is:\n$$\n\\text{moles of } NiCl_2 : \\text{moles of } ZnCl_2 : \\text{moles of } FeCl_3 = 0.5 : 0.5 : 2\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed as the simplest integer ratio. To convert the ratio $0.5 : 0.5 : 2$ into a set of simplest integers, we need to find the smallest multiplier that will make all numbers in the ratio whole numbers. The presence of the decimal $0.5$ suggests multiplying all parts of the ratio by 2.\n\nMultiplying each part of the ratio by 2:\n$$\n(0.5 \\times 2) : (0.5 \\times 2) : (2 \\times 2)\n$$\n$$\n1 : 1 : 4\n$$\n\nThis gives the simplest integer ratio. The integers are 1, 1, and 4. These are already the smallest possible integers (their greatest common divisor is 1), so this is the final answer.\n\nThe required molar ratio of $NiCl_2$ to $ZnCl_2$ to $FeCl_3$ is $1:1:4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1290062"}, {"introduction": "Once the precursor ratios are determined, the next practical step is to calculate the expected amount of product.
