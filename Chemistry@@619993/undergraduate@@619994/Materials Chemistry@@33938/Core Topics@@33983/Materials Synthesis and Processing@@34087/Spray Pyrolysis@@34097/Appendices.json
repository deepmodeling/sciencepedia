As the system cools to room temperature $T_\\text{room}$, both materials attempt to contract. The amount of linear contraction each material would undergo if it were free is proportional to its coefficient of thermal expansion ($\\alpha$) and the change in temperature ($\\Delta T$).\n\nThe change in temperature is:\n$$ \\Delta T = T_\\text{room} - T_\\text{dep} $$\n$$ \\Delta T = 25 \\text{ °C} - 500 \\text{ °C} = -475 \\text{ °C} = -475 \\text{ K} $$\nNote that a change in temperature has the same magnitude in Celsius and Kelvin.\n\nIf they were not bonded, the unconstrained thermal strain for the film ($\\epsilon_\\text{f}$) and substrate ($\\epsilon_\\text{s}$) would be:\n$$ \\epsilon_\\text{f} = \\alpha_\\text{f} \\Delta T $$\n$$ \\epsilon_\\text{s} = \\alpha_\\text{s} \\Delta T $$\n\nHowever, the film is thin and bonded to a very thick substrate.
