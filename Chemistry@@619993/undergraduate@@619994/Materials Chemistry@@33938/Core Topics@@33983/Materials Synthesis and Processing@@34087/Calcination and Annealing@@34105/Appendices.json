The rigorous definition of calcination is a thermal treatment process applied to solid materials to bring about thermal decomposition, typically resulting in an irreversible chemical change and the removal of a volatile fraction (such as water or carbon dioxide).\n\nConsider the following descriptions of material processing:\n\nI. A sample of raw limestone, primarily calcium carbonate ($CaCO_3$), is heated in a large kiln to over 900°C. This drives off carbon dioxide gas and produces calcium oxide ($CaO$), a product known as quicklime.\nII. A newly forged steel alloy component, which is brittle, is heated to a temperature below its melting point and held for several hours before being allowed to cool slowly. This process relieves internal stresses and significantly increases the component's toughness by altering its crystalline microstructure.\nIII. A thin film of vanadium dioxide ($VO_2$) is gently heated past 68°C. It undergoes a fully reversible structural phase transition that causes its color to change from blue to red. Upon cooling below 68°C, it returns to its original blue state without any mass loss or change in chemical composition.\nIV. A quantity of blue hydrous alum, potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate ($KAl(SO_4)_2 \\cdot 12H_2O$), is heated in a crucible. The compound loses its water of crystallization and transforms into a white anhydrous powder.\n\nBased on the provided definition, which of these processes are **not** examples of calcination?\n\nA.

This is annealing (or tempering) rather than calcination; it is not calcination.\n\nCase III: $VO_2$ undergoes a reversible phase transition near a modest temperature with no mass loss and no change in chemical composition. There is no decomposition and no release of a volatile fraction. This is not calcination.\n\nCase IV: Dehydration of hydrous alum removes water of crystallization:\n$$\nKAl(SO_{4})_{2}\\cdot 12H_{2}O(s) \\rightarrow KAl(SO_{4})_{2}(s) + 12H_{2}O(g)\n$$\nThis is thermal decomposition of the hydrate with removal of a volatile fraction ($H_2O$).
