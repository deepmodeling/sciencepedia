The reactants are barium carbonate ($BaCO_3$) and titanium dioxide ($TiO_2$), and the products are barium titanate ($BaTiO_3$) and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$). The unbalanced equation is:\n$$BaCO_3(s) + TiO_2(s) \\rightarrow BaTiO_3(s) + CO_2(g)$$\nTo balance the equation, we count the atoms of each element on both sides.\n- Barium (Ba): 1 on the left, 1 on the right.\n- Carbon (C): 1 on the left, 1 on the right.\n- Titanium (Ti): 1 on the left, 1 on the right.\n- Oxygen (O): 3 from $BaCO_3$ + 2 from $TiO_2$ = 5 on the left. 3 from $BaTiO_3$ + 2 from $CO_2$ = 5 on the right.\nThe equation is already balanced with stoichiometric coefficients of 1 for all species. This tells us that for every 1 mole of $BaTiO_3$ produced, 1 mole of $CO_2$ is evolved.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the number of moles of $BaTiO_3$ corresponding to the target mass of 15.0 g. To do this, we first need the molar mass of $BaTiO_3$. Using the provided atomic molar masses:\n$$M(BaTiO_3) = M(Ba) + M(Ti) + 3 \\times M(O)$$\n$$M(BaTiO_3) = 137.33 \\text{ g/mol} + 47.87 \\text{ g/mol} + 3 \\times 16.00 \\text{ g/mol}$$\n$$M(BaTiO_3) = 137.33 + 47.87 + 48.00 = 233.20 \\text{ g/mol}$$\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles ($n$) of $BaTiO_3$ using the formula $n = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{molar mass}}$:\n$$n_{BaTiO_3} = \\frac{15.0 \\text{ g}}{233.20 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 0.06432247 \\text{ mol}$$\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, the stoichiometric ratio between $BaTiO_3$ and $CO_2$ is 1:1.

The assembly is heated to 1200 °C, a temperature sufficient for ionic diffusion to occur but below the melting point of any reactant or potential product.\n\nFrom prior thermodynamic studies of the A-B-O ternary system at 1200 °C, the following information is known:\n1.  Besides the reactants $AO$ and $B_2O_3$, exactly two other stable ternary compounds exist within the system. Their chemical formulas are $A_2BO_4$ and $AB_2O_5$.\n2.  The equilibrium compatibility relationships (which define the sub-solidus phase diagram) have been established. A tie-line exists between a pair of compounds if they can coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. The known tie-lines are:\n    *   $AO$ and $A_2BO_4$ are in equilibrium.\n    *   $A_2BO_4$ and $AB_2O_5$ are in equilibrium.\n    *   $AB_2O_5$ and $B_2O_3$ are in equilibrium.\n    *   There is no direct tie-line between the initial reactants $AO$ and $B_2O_3$.\n\nAssuming the reaction proceeds via the formation of distinct, planar product layers at the interface due to the interdiffusion of cations, determine the correct sequence of these intermediate product layers.

This can be predicted by analyzing the diffusion path on the equilibrium phase diagram.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the formation of product layers in a solid-state reaction is that the sequence of phases found at the reaction interface must correspond to the sequence of phase fields crossed by a straight line, known as the diffusion path, connecting the compositions of the initial reactants on the equilibrium phase diagram. Each product phase must be in thermodynamic equilibrium with its neighbors.\n\nThe reactants are $AO$ and $B_2O_3$. On the ternary A-B-O phase diagram, these two compositions represent two points. The diffusion path is the straight line connecting the point for $AO$ to the point for $B_2O_3$.\n\nThe problem provides the stable phases and their equilibrium relationships (tie-lines) at the reaction temperature. The stable phases are $AO$, $B_2O_3$, $A_2BO_4$, and $AB_2O_5$. The existence of tie-lines tells us which phases can form a stable interface with one another.\nThe given tie-lines are:\n1.  ($AO$, $A_2BO_4$)\n2.  ($A_2BO_4$, $AB_2O_5$)\n3.  ($AB_2O_5$, $B_2O_3$)\n\nThe fact that there is no direct tie-line between $AO$ and $B_2O_3$ confirms that they are not in equilibrium with each other and will react to form intermediate compounds.\n\nThe diffusion path from $AO$ to $B_2O_3$ must cross any tie-lines that lie between them. The sequence of phases along this path dictates the sequence of product layers. We can reconstruct the ordering of phases along this path by using the given equilibrium pairs.\n\nStarting from the $AO$ reactant, we look for the phase it is in equilibrium with. The problem states there is a tie-line between $AO$ and $A_2BO_4$. This means the first product layer adjacent to the $AO$ reactant must be $A_2BO_4$. This maintains local equilibrium at the $AO | A_2BO_4$ interface.\n\nNext, we consider the other side of this new $A_2BO_4$ layer. According to the principle, $A_2BO_4$ must be in equilibrium with the next layer. The problem states there is a tie-line between $A_2BO_4$ and $AB_2O_5$. Therefore, the next product layer in the sequence must be $AB_2O_5$. This establishes a stable $A_2BO_4 | AB_2O_5$ interface.\n\nFinally, we consider the other side of the $AB_2O_5$ layer. It must be in equilibrium with the remaining reactant, $B_2O_3$. The problem confirms this by stating there is a tie-line between $AB_2O_5$ and $B_2O_3$. This establishes the final stable interface, $AB_2O_5 | B_2O_3$.\n\nThus, the complete sequence of layers, from the $AO$ side to the $B_2O_3$ side, is:\n[$AO$ reactant] | [$A_2BO_4$ layer] | [$AB_2O_5$ layer] | [$B_2O_3$ reactant]\n\nThe intermediate product layers that form are $A_2BO_4$ and $AB_2O_5$. Their sequence, starting from the $AO$ side, is $A_2BO_4$ first, followed by $AB_2O_5$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. A layer of $A_2BO_4$ followed by a layer of $AB_2O_5$. This matches our derived sequence.\nB. A layer of $AB_2O_5$ followed by a layer of $A_2BO_4$. This is the reverse sequence and is incorrect. $AB_2O_5$ is not in equilibrium with $AO$.\nC. A single, distinct layer of $A_2BO_4$. This is incomplete. It would imply $A_2BO_4$ is in equilibrium with $B_2O_3$, which contradicts the given information.\nD. A single, distinct layer of $AB_2O_5$. This is incomplete. It would imply $AB_2O_5$ is in equilibrium with $AO$, which is not given and contradicts the path.\nE. A single, mixed-phase layer. This violates the principle of forming distinct, sequential product layers, each corresponding to a stable single-phase region on the phase diagram.\nF. No intermediate layers form. This is incorrect because the reactants are not in equilibrium, so a reaction must occur.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of product layers is $A_2BO_4$ followed by $AB_2O_5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1335790"}, {"introduction": "Once we know which product layers form, the next critical question is *how* they grow.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:1335757] places you in the role of an experimentalist, asking you to interpret the results of a hypothetical isotopic labeling experiment. By analyzing the distribution of an oxygen isotope ($^{18}O$), you can deduce the dominant mass transport mechanism, a skill essential for uncovering the fundamental kinetics of solid-state transformations.", "problem": "A materials chemist is investigating the reaction mechanism for the solid-state synthesis of Strontium Titanate ($SrTiO_3$), a perovskite ceramic, from its constituent oxides, Strontium Oxide ($SrO$) and Titanium Dioxide ($TiO_2$). The overall reaction is given by $SrO + TiO_2 \\rightarrow SrTiO_3$.\n\nTo determine the dominant mobile ionic species during the reaction, an isotopic labeling experiment is designed. A dense, polycrystalline pellet of $SrO$ is placed in direct contact with a polished single crystal of $TiO_2$. The initial reactant materials, $SrO$ and $TiO_2$, were synthesized using oxygen of natural isotopic abundance, which consists almost entirely of the $^{16}O$ isotope. The entire assembly is then heated to a temperature of $1350^\\circ C$ for several hours in a furnace with a controlled atmosphere that is highly enriched with the heavy oxygen isotope, $^{18}O_2$.\n\nAfter cooling, a cross-section of the reaction zone is prepared and analyzed using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). This technique can measure the concentration of specific isotopes as a function of depth. A distinct, uniform layer of the product, $SrTiO_3$, is observed to have formed at the interface between the original $SrO$ and $TiO_2$ reactants.\n\nWhich one of the following hypothetical descriptions of the $^{18}O$ concentration profile, as measured by SIMS across the $SrO | SrTiO_3 | TiO_2$ layers, would provide definitive evidence that the counter-diffusion of cations ($Sr^{2+}$ and $Ti^{4+}$) is the dominant mass transport mechanism for the growth of the $SrTiO_3$ product layer?\n\nA. The $^{18}O$ concentration is found to be significantly above background levels only at the surfaces of the assembly that were directly exposed to the furnace atmosphere. Within the bulk of the $SrTiO_3$ product layer, the $^{18}O$ concentration is negligible and similar to the background level found in the bulk of the original $SrO$ and $TiO_2$ reactants.\n\nB. The $^{18}O$ concentration is found to be high and relatively uniform throughout the entire thickness of the newly formed $SrTiO_3$ product layer.\n\nC.

The $^{18}O$ concentration is found to be high only in a narrow region localized at the original $TiO_2/SrTiO_3$ interface, and negligible everywhere else.\n\nE. The $^{18}O$ concentration is at background levels everywhere in the solid sample, indicating no exchange occurred between the gas atmosphere and the solid materials.", "solution": "We begin with the reaction $SrO + TiO_2 \\rightarrow SrTiO_3$. The oxygen stoichiometry is balanced: the reactants provide exactly three oxygen atoms per formula unit of $SrTiO_3$, so no net oxygen uptake from the gas is required for product formation. Thus, which ionic species mediates mass transport during growth can be probed by an oxygen isotope tracer without changing the overall stoichiometry.\n\nIn the experiment, the external gas is highly enriched in $^{18}O_2$, while the solids initially contain $^{16}O$. Isotope exchange at a free surface establishes a high $^{18}O$ fraction at that surface; subsequent transport of $^{18}O$ into the solid interior requires mobile oxygen defects (oxygen vacancies or interstitials) and is governed by diffusion. Therefore:\n- If oxygen anions are the dominant mobile species responsible for product-layer growth, the tracer $^{18}O$ must be transported from the exposed surfaces into the interior toward the buried $SrO | SrTiO_3 | TiO_2$ region. Detectable $^{18}O$ within the $SrTiO_3$ product layer would then be expected. Depending on where the growth front is and which phase provides the oxygen flux, this would appear as either a broadly elevated and relatively uniform $^{18}O$ level throughout the product ($^{18}O$ exchange and diffusion pervasive), or as a localized enrichment near the specific interface where oxygen arrives from the nearest exposed surface (indicating directional oxygen-ion transport through that adjacent phase).\n- If, instead, counter-diffusion of cations ($Sr^{2+}$ and $Ti^{4+}$) through the $SrTiO_3$ product layer is the dominant mass transport mechanism, then the oxygen sublattice does not need to move appreciably: the oxygen in $SrTiO_3$ is supplied locally from the adjacent $SrO$ and $TiO_2$ lattices. In this case, the $^{18}O$ from the gas cannot reach the buried reaction zone unless oxygen diffusion is significant. Thus, under cation-dominated transport with negligible oxygen mobility, the $^{18}O$ signal should be confined to the external surfaces that directly exchange with the gas, and the $SrTiO_3$ product layer at the buried interface should remain at background $^{18}O$ levels.\n\nInterpreting the proposed SIMS profiles:\n- Option B (high and uniform $^{18}O$ throughout the $SrTiO_3$ layer) implies extensive oxygen exchange and diffusion within the product layer, consistent with oxygen-ion transport, not cation-dominated transport.\n- Options C and D (localized $^{18}O$ enrichment at one buried interface only) require that oxygen tracer has diffused from an exposed surface through one of the solids to the reaction front, again indicating oxygen-ion transport through that specific phase.\n- Option E (background everywhere) would imply no measurable oxygen exchange even at free surfaces, which is not informative about the internal transport mechanism and is physically unlikely under the stated high-temperature, enriched $^{18}O_2$ conditions.\n- Option A (significant $^{18}O$ only at exposed surfaces; negligible $^{18}O$ in the bulk, including the $SrTiO_3$ product layer) directly indicates that oxygen did not penetrate to the buried reaction zone over the experimental time, while a substantial $SrTiO_3$ layer nevertheless formed. Given the oxygen balance of the reaction, this is definitive evidence that growth proceeded by counter-diffusion of cations across the product layer, with the oxygen sublattice essentially stationary on the experimental timescale.\n\nTherefore, the $^{18}O$ profile that provides definitive evidence that cation counter-diffusion dominates is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1335757"}]}
