This process typically involves the hydrolysis of silicon alkoxides, which have the general formula $R'_nSi(OR)_{4-n}$, followed by their condensation to form a siloxane (Si-O-Si) network. In this formula, $R$ represents an alkyl group (like ethyl, $-C_2H_5$) that is removed during hydrolysis, while $R'$ represents a non-hydrolyzable organic group (like methyl, $-CH_3$) that remains attached to the silicon atom.

Hydrolysis replaces $OR$ by $OH$ while releasing alcohol:\n$$Si(OR)_{4-h}(OH)_h + H_2O \\rightarrow Si(OR)_{3-h}(OH)_{h+1} + ROH$$\napplied iteratively. Full hydrolysis to $Si(OH)_4$ requires $4$ hydrolysis events per silicon and thus $4$ water molecules per $Si(OR)_4$ molecule.\n\nCondensation builds the silica network via two generic reactions:\n$$(i) \\quad \\text{Si-OH} + \\text{HO-Si} \\rightarrow \\text{Si-O-Si} + H_2O$$\n$$(ii) \\quad \\text{Si-OH} + \\text{RO-Si} \\rightarrow \\text{Si-O-Si} + ROH$$\nBoth reactions increase connectivity by forming $Si\\text{-}O\\text{-}Si$ bridges; each condensation consumes one $Si\\text{-}OH$ group.\n\nLet $R_w$ denote the molar ratio of water to $Si(OR)_4$.

In the present system, the reactive $A$-type groups are $Si\\text{-}OH$ (generated by hydrolysis) and the $B$-type groups are $Si\\text{-}OR$; condensation predominantly follows reaction (ii) when $Si\\text{-}OH$ is scarce.

In step-growth polymerization, severe stoichiometric imbalance suppresses gelation because the minority functional group limits the maximum achievable crosslink density; in particular, when the average number of $A$ groups per network-forming unit is less than $2$, an infinite cluster cannot form at any extent of reaction.\n\nEquivalently, each silicon center can at most contribute a number of $Si\\text{-}O\\text{-}Si$ bridges equal to the number of $Si\\text{-}OH$ groups it bears prior to condensation, because each bridge formation consumes one $Si\\text{-}OH$. When $\\bar{h}  2$, the average connectivity per node remains below the threshold required for percolation into a sample-spanning gel, leading instead to finite-sized, soluble species. Under these water-deficient conditions, hydrolysis does occur (contradicting a purely unreacted monomer solution), but it is incomplete; condensation preferentially yields primarily linear or weakly branched oligomers/polymers that do not reach the gel point.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is inconsistent because rapid formation of a dense, fully cross-linked gel requires sufficient hydrolysis (typically approaching four $Si\\text{-}OH$ per silicon or at least enough to exceed the gel point), which is precluded by $R_w \\ll 2$.\n- Option B is incorrect because even small amounts of water initiate hydrolysis; the system does not remain as unreacted monomers.\n- Option C matches the prediction: soluble, mostly linear or weakly branched silica-based oligomers form without a continuous gel network.\n- Option D is incompatible with the limiting water; complete hydrolysis to $Si(OH)_4$ cannot occur at $R_w \\ll 2$, nor would it yield discrete non-polymeric $SiO_2$ under sol-gel conditions.\n- Option E requires gelation despite water deficiency; the dominant outcome instead is sub-gel oligomer formation rather than a biphasic gel-plus-monomer system.\n\nHence, the most likely final state is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1334571"}]}
