The student is informed that the samples are Polystyrene (PS) and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), one of each. To identify them, the student performs an analysis using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), heating each sample at a constant rate from room temperature. The results are as follows:\n\n- **Sample A**: The DSC thermogram shows a distinct step-like shift in the baseline heat flow at approximately 100 °C. No other significant thermal events, such as peaks, are observed at higher temperatures.\n- **Sample B**: The DSC thermogram first shows a step-like shift in the baseline heat flow around 70-80 °C. As heating continues, a large, sharp endothermic peak is observed with a maximum at approximately 255 °C.\n\nBased on these thermal analysis results, what are the correct identities of Sample A and Sample B?\n\nA.

For a material without latent heat effects, the baseline heat flow scales with the heat capacity $C_{p}$ according to $\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = C_{p}\\,\\beta$. Two characteristic thermal events for polymers are:\n- The glass transition at temperature $T_{g}$, which is not a first-order transition and therefore does not involve latent heat. It manifests as a step-like change in baseline due to a change in heat capacity, quantified by $\\Delta C_{p} = C_{p,\\mathrm{rubbery}} - C_{p,\\mathrm{glassy}} > 0$. Thus, at $T \\approx T_{g}$, one observes a baseline shift but no peak.\n- The melting transition at temperature $T_{m}$ for semicrystalline polymers, which is a first-order transition with latent heat $\\Delta H_{m} > 0$. This appears as a sharp endothermic peak whose area satisfies $\\Delta H_{m} = \\int \\frac{\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{excess}}(T)}{\\beta}\\,dT$.\n\nPolystyrene (PS) is an amorphous polymer. Its DSC thermogram characteristically shows a single glass transition near $T_{g}^{\\mathrm{PS}} \\approx 100\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, with a step-like baseline shift and no melting peak because PS lacks crystalline domains and thus has no $T_{m}$. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is typically semicrystalline.
