This practice provides a clear, mathematical reason for a crucial laboratory technique, transforming a procedural step into a understood scientific principle.", "problem": "An analytical chemist is preparing a solid sample for analysis using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The technique involves creating a transparent pellet by mixing the sample with potassium bromide (KBr) powder, grinding the mixture, and pressing it under high pressure. A critical factor for obtaining a high-quality spectrum is the particle size of the sample. If the particles are too large, they scatter the infrared radiation, which results in a distorted, sloping baseline that can obscure important spectral features.\n\nTo quantify this phenomenon, a simplified model is proposed for the absorbance due to scattering, $A_s$, through a pellet. In the regime where the sample particle radius, $r$, is significantly smaller than the radiation wavelength, $\\lambda$, the scattering absorbance can be described by the following relation:\n$$ A_s = C \\frac{r^3}{\\lambda^4} $$\nHere, $C$ is a constant that depends on properties like pellet thickness, sample concentration, and the refractive indices of the sample and the KBr matrix. The relationship between wavelength $\\lambda$ and wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ (in units of cm⁻¹) is $\\lambda = 1/\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\nThe chemist prepares two pellets, Pellet 1 and Pellet 2, using the same amount of sample and KBr, resulting in pellets of identical thickness and sample concentration.\n- **Pellet 1** is prepared using a coarse grinding method, which produces particles with an average radius of $r_1$.\n- **Pellet 2** is prepared using a very fine grinding method, resulting in particles with an average radius of $r_2$, where $r_2 = r_1 / 5$.\n\nThe distortion caused by scattering is often assessed by the \"absorbance tilt\" of the baseline, which is defined as the difference in scattering absorbance between the high and low wavenumber ends of a spectral range.
