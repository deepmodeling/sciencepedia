If either condition is violated, the measured intensities deviate from proportionality to concentration, invalidating standardless quantification.\n\nThe attenuation of X-rays within the specimen is governed by Beer-Lambert law. For an X-ray of energy $E$ generated at depth coordinate $z$ with a path length $\\ell(z)$ to the detector through a matrix of density $\\rho$ and mass attenuation coefficient $\\mu_{m}(E)$, the transmitted intensity from that depth is multiplied by\n$$\n\\exp\\!\\big(-\\mu_{m}(E)\\,\\rho\\,\\ell(z)\\big).\n$$\nElement-dependent attenuation arises because $\\mu_{m}(E)$ varies strongly with $E$, so lines of different energy are attenuated differently.\n\nSecondary fluorescence adds an extra term to the measured intensity of an element. For element B, the measured intensity can be decomposed as\n$$\nI_{B}^{\\mathrm{meas}}=I_{B}^{\\mathrm{primary}}+I_{B}^{\\mathrm{sec}},\n$$\nwhere $I_{B}^{\\mathrm{sec}}$ arises from absorption of X-rays from another element A with energy above B’s absorption edge, followed by radiative relaxation in B. This violates the assumption that $I_{B}$ is solely due to primary electron excitation and hence spoils the proportionality used by the Cliff-Lorimer equation.\n\nWe now assess each option:\n\nA. Significant absorption of characteristic X-rays by the matrix increases the factor $\\exp\\!\\big(-\\mu_{m}(E)\\,\\rho\\,\\ell\\big)$ attenuation for the escaping signal. Because $\\mu_{m}(E)$ is energy dependent, different elements are attenuated by different amounts.

Secondary X-ray fluorescence adds $I_{B}^{\\mathrm{sec}}$ correlated with the flux of higher-energy X-rays from heavier elements, not directly with $C_{B}$ via a single $k$-factor. This violates the no-fluorescence condition of the thin-foil approximation and introduces significant bias. Valid.\n\nC. Delocalization of inelastic scattering (plasmon or core-loss signals) is an EELS concern and relates to spatial resolution of inelastic events. It does not, by itself, cause X-ray absorption or secondary fluorescence, and thus does not violate the thin-foil approximation assumptions for EDS. Any spatial averaging it induces does not invalidate the proportionality if composition is uniform. Not valid.\n\nD. Broadening of the incident electron beam increases the analysis volume but does not inherently cause absorption or fluorescence. If the foil remains sufficiently thin (small $\\rho\\,\\ell$ for all generated X-rays), absorption remains negligible. Beam broadening affects spatial resolution more than the thin-foil validity. Not valid.\n\nE. A significant thickness gradient causes a distribution of path lengths $\\ell(z)$ to the detector across the analyzed region; the measured intensity becomes a thickness-weighted integral\n$$\nI(E)\\propto \\int I_{0}(z)\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-\\mu_{m}(E)\\,\\rho\\,\\ell(z)\\big)\\,dz,\n$$\nwhich is element-energy dependent. This leads to differential absorption and violates the thin-foil assumption when the gradient is large enough, producing quantification errors. Valid.\n\nF.

When faced with ambiguous data, such as broadened diffraction peaks from an initial characterization, a researcher must design a follow-up experiment to isolate the contributing factors.

To perform an initial structural characterization, the student uses powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The resulting diffraction pattern shows that the peaks corresponding to the desired crystal structure are present, but they are significantly broader than the instrumental resolution. The student hypothesizes that this broadening is a convoluted effect of both very small crystallite domains and the presence of significant non-uniform lattice microstrain, potentially arising from defects or compositional gradients within the nanoparticles.\n\nTo deconvolute these two contributions, the student gains access to a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) equipped with various imaging and diffraction attachments.

Use Bright-Field (BF) imaging to get a general overview of the particle morphology. Then, use Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) on a large ensemble of particles and analyze the broadening of the diffraction rings to determine an average crystallite size, assuming strain effects are negligible in this mode.\n\nB.

Use Dark-Field (DF) imaging by forming an image with a specific segment of a diffraction ring to selectively illuminate and measure the size of crystallites in that specific orientation, repeating for different segments to build a statistical size distribution.

Use a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to measure the average particle diameter, assuming this is equivalent to the crystallite size.

In TEM, dark-field imaging formed from specific diffraction vectors selects only those crystallites satisfying the Bragg condition for that vector; the sizes of bright regions in the DF image correspond to coherent domain sizes in projection.\n- Microstrain is most directly quantified by local measurements of lattice parameter variations or local distortions of the reciprocal lattice. In diffraction, a local change in spacing $\\Delta d$ corresponds to a reciprocal-space shift $\\Delta g$ with $d = 2\\pi/|g|$, so for small strains $\\epsilon \\approx -\\Delta g/g$. More generally, if $G_{0}$ is the reference reciprocal basis and $G_{\\text{meas}}(\\mathbf{r})$ the locally measured basis from a scanned nanobeam diffraction pattern at position $\\mathbf{r}$, then for small deformations one can extract the deformation gradient $F(\\mathbf{r})$ from $G_{\\text{meas}} = F^{-T} G_{0}$ and compute the small-strain tensor as $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(F(\\mathbf{r}) + F^{T}(\\mathbf{r})\\right) - I$.\n\nEvaluation of the proposed plans:\nA. BF overview plus SAED ring broadening for size while neglecting strain is not valid for the stated problem. In polycrystalline ensembles, SAED ring broadening contains both size and strain contributions, analogous to XRD peak broadening. Without an independent strain measurement or a method such as Williamson–Hall analysis with suitable assumptions, the separation cannot be performed, and assuming strain is negligible contradicts the hypothesis. This plan is neither comprehensive nor independent for the two contributions.\n\nB. Manually measuring crystalline domains in many HRTEM images is inefficient and biased by orientation, thickness, and imaging artifacts. The measured “domain” lengths in HRTEM are not guaranteed to represent coherently diffracting domain sizes across orientations. FFT-based qualitative checks for strain are not quantitative; spot distortions in small FFT windows depend on local imaging conditions and do not, by themselves, yield calibrated strain tensors. This plan is not efficient or quantitatively comprehensive.\n\nC. DF imaging using a selected segment of a diffraction ring isolates crystallites that satisfy a specific $g$-vector condition. The bright features in the DF image correspond to coherently diffracting domains; measuring their projected sizes yields a direct estimate of crystallite size. By repeating for multiple non-collinear ring segments, one builds a statistical size distribution that reduces orientation bias. For quantitative strain, nanometer-scale focused probe diffraction, such as NBED (or 4D-STEM), is used to scan across individual crystallites and acquire a diffraction pattern at each position. From each pattern, one measures the positions of diffraction spots or HOLZ features to extract local $g$-vectors. With a calibrated reference $G_{0}$, the local strain follows from measured shifts via $\\epsilon \\approx -\\Delta g/g$ for uniaxial components or, more generally, via the deformation gradient reconstruction $G_{\\text{meas}} = F^{-T} G_{0}$ and $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(F + F^{T}\\right) - I$. This provides a direct, spatially resolved, and quantitative microstrain map independent of the size measurement. The approach is efficient because DF images rapidly survey many particles for size statistics, and NBED scans provide automated, quantitative strain mapping. Precession can be added to NBED to improve kinematic conditions and precision, but the core plan already meets the stated goals.\n\nD. SEM particle diameters do not equal crystallite sizes for polycrystalline particles; a single particle can contain multiple coherent domains. EDS maps reveal composition but do not directly measure strain. Attributing compositional inhomogeneity to microstrain without diffraction-based lattice measurements is not rigorous. This plan does not independently or quantitatively assess either target.\n\nE. BF imaging yields particle size distribution, not crystallite size distribution. GPA on HRTEM lattice fringes can yield quantitative strain maps under strict conditions (highly stable, thin, well-oriented regions, appropriate reference region, minimized artifacts), but it is sensitive to thickness, defocus, and imaging distortions. It also samples relatively small areas and specific orientations, making ensemble-wide, efficient quantification challenging. Moreover, this plan lacks a direct, orientation-agnostic measurement of crystallite sizes. Hence it is not as comprehensive or efficient as a DF plus NBED approach.\n\nConclusion based on the physical measurement principles above:\n- The only plan that directly, efficiently, and comprehensively decouples and quantifies crystallite size and microstrain is the combination of DF imaging of ring segments for size statistics together with NBED-based local diffraction mapping for quantitative strain.
