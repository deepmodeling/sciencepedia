The diffractometer is configured in the standard Bragg-Brentano geometry, where the sample, X-ray source, and detector all lie on a focusing circle. For this geometry to work perfectly, the surface of the flat powder sample must be precisely aligned with the axis of rotation of the goniometer.\n\nDuring sample preparation, the student makes a small but consistent error. The flat surface of the powder sample is mounted at a constant height slightly *above* the ideal sample plane, displaced towards the X-ray detector and away from the goniometer's center.

The positions of the peaks are unaffected by this type of mounting error.", "solution": "The problem describes a systematic error in a powder XRD experiment using the Bragg-Brentano geometry. To understand the effect of this error, we must analyze the geometry of the X-ray path.\n\nIn the ideal Bragg-Brentano setup, the X-ray source (S), the sample surface at the goniometer's rotation axis (O), and the detector (D) all lie on the circumference of a focusing circle. The incident beam from the source makes an angle $\\theta$ with the sample surface, and the diffracted beam leaves the sample at an angle $\\theta$ to the surface, entering the detector. The angle between the incident beam and the detected beam is $2\\theta$. At a Bragg peak, the condition for constructive interference, given by Bragg's Law ($2d\\sin\\theta = n\\lambda$), is met for a specific set of lattice planes with spacing $d$.\n\nNow, let's introduce the error. The sample surface is displaced by a small height $s$ *above* the ideal plane at O. This means the X-rays are now diffracting from a surface that is closer to the detector. Let's call a point on this displaced surface P.\n\nThe incident X-ray beam, aimed at the center of rotation O, will instead strike the displaced surface at point P. The angle of incidence with the sample surface is still $\\theta$. According to Bragg's Law, for a peak to be observed, the diffracted ray must leave the crystal planes (which are parallel to the sample surface) at the same angle $\\theta$. Therefore, the diffracted ray originating from P will be parallel to the ideal diffracted ray that would have originated from O.\n\nThe crucial point is to determine where this new, parallel-shifted ray intersects the path of the detector. The detector moves along a circular arc centered on the goniometer axis O. A ray originating from the displaced point P, which is above the ideal plane of diffraction O, and traveling parallel to the ideal diffracted path will intersect the detector's circular path at a smaller angle than the ideal ray.\n\nLet $2\\theta_{\\text{true}}$ be the true angle for a given Bragg reflection. Due to the sample displacement, the detector will register the peak at a measured angle $2\\theta_{\\text{meas}}$. Because the diffracted ray originates from a point P that is effectively \"ahead\" of the ideal point O along the path to the detector, the detector encounters this ray earlier in its angular sweep. This means the measured angle $2\\theta_{\\text{meas}}$ will be smaller than the true angle $2\\theta_{\\text{true}}$.\n\nThis effect occurs for all diffraction angles, meaning every peak in the diffractogram will be systematically shifted to a lower $2\\theta$ value compared to its true position. While the magnitude of the angular shift, $\\Delta(2\\theta) = 2\\theta_{\\text{meas}} - 2\\theta_{\\text{true}}$, is not constant and actually depends on $\\theta$ (specifically, $\\Delta(2\\theta) \\approx -2s \\cos\\theta / R$, where $R$ is the goniometer radius), the shift is always negative for a positive displacement $s$ (sample mounted 'above' the ideal plane).\n\nTherefore, all diffraction peaks are shifted to lower $2\\theta$ values. This makes option A the correct choice. Option B describes the effect of mounting the sample *below* the ideal plane. Option C describes peak broadening, which is also a consequence of sample displacement due to loss of focus, but the primary effect on peak *position* is the systematic shift. Options D and E are incorrect as the shift is systematic and always in one direction for this type of error.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1327151"}]}
