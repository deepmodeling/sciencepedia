A common task is to determine the\nthree-dimensional (3D) size distribution of features, such as spherical precipitates in an alloy, from their two-dimensional (2D) circular cross-sections observed in a micrograph. This process, known as stereology, is necessary because a 2D polished surface will slice through spheres at random distances from their centers, meaning a large sphere can appear as a small circle.\n\nAn engineer is analyzing a new metal matrix composite containing a dispersion of perfectly spherical ceramic particles. A micrograph of a polished cross-section is analyzed, and the observed circular profiles are sorted into five size classes based on their radius, $r$. The class width is defined by a constant $\\Delta = 5.0$ nm. A circular profile belongs to class $i$ if its radius $r$ satisfies $(i-1)\\Delta < r \\le i\\Delta$.
