By the stated convention, endothermic events in the sample produce negative (downward) peaks, and exothermic events produce positive (upward) peaks.\n\nObservation 1: A broad downward peak from about $90\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ to $160\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ indicates a broad endothermic process over a temperature range, not a sharp first-order transition. In thermal analysis of powders, such broad low-temperature endotherms are characteristic of the removal of physically adsorbed or loosely bound water (desorption/dehydration), which occurs over a range of temperatures and requires heat input, hence endothermic. In contrast, melting typically appears as a relatively sharp endothermic peak at a specific temperature for a crystalline phase; an amorphous material does not show a true first-order melting peak, and a glass transition appears primarily as a baseline shift (step in heat capacity) rather than a pronounced peak. Therefore, the most consistent assignment for the broad low-temperature endotherm is desorption of surface-adsorbed water.\n\nObservation 2: A sharp, narrow upward peak centered at $450\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ indicates a well-defined exothermic event. For an amorphous inorganic powder, the most common exothermic process upon heating is crystallization (devitrification), which releases latent heat as the structure orders, producing a sharp exotherm at a characteristic crystallization temperature. Oxidative decomposition is also exothermic but generally pertains to organics or materials containing oxidizable species, not generic inorganic amorphous powders; moreover, the prior broad endotherm at low temperature is more consistent with water removal than with a process that would precede oxidative decomposition. Solid-state polymorphic transitions can be exothermic or endothermic, but their pairing with a subsequent sublimation (endothermic) would not match the observed exothermic second peak.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A. Melting (endothermic) followed by oxidative decomposition (exothermic): The first feature is too broad and too low in temperature to be a typical melting peak, especially for an amorphous inorganic powder, and amorphous materials do not exhibit a true melting peak; thus inconsistent.\n- B. Glass transition (endothermic step) followed by melting (endothermic peak): The second observed peak is exothermic, contradicting this option.\n- C. Crystallization (exothermic) followed by melting (endothermic): The observed sequence shows the endothermic event first and the exothermic later, so the order and signs do not match.\n- D. Desorption of surface-adsorbed water (endothermic, broad) followed by crystallization of the amorphous material (exothermic, sharp): This matches both the sign and the shape/temperature characteristics.\n- E. Polymorphic transition followed by sublimation: Sublimation is endothermic, but the second observed peak is exothermic; inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible sequence is desorption of surface-adsorbed water followed by crystallization of the amorphous material.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1343351"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying thermal events, DTA provides a powerful quantitative tool for measuring their associated energy changes.
