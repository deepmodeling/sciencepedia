The goal is to create an alloy with a high degree of solute solubility, forming an extensive substitutional solid solution. Two candidate elements are being considered for addition to the copper (Cu) solvent: aluminum (Al) and nickel (Ni).\n\nTo make an informed decision, an analysis based on the fundamental principles of alloy formation is required. You are provided with the following data for the three elements:\n\n| Element   | Atomic Radius (nm) | Crystal Structure | Electronegativity (Pauling Scale) | Common Valence |\n|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Copper (Cu) | 0.128              | FCC               | 1.90                              | +2             |\n| Aluminum (Al)| 0.143              | FCC               | 1.61                              | +3             |\n| Nickel (Ni) | 0.125              | FCC               | 1.91                              | +2             |\n\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the factors governing the formation of substitutional solid solutions, determine which element is the more suitable candidate.\n\nSelect the best option from the choices below.\n\nA. Aluminum is the more suitable candidate.\n\nB. Nickel is the more suitable candidate.\n\nC. Both aluminum and nickel are equally suitable candidates.\n\nD. Neither aluminum nor nickel are suitable candidates for forming an extensive solid solution.", "solution": "To determine which element, aluminum (Al) or nickel (Ni), is a more suitable candidate to form an extensive substitutional solid solution with copper (Cu), we must apply the four Hume-Rothery rules for substitutional solid solutions. We will evaluate each candidate element against these rules relative to the copper solvent.\n\nThe four Hume-Rothery rules are:\n1.  **Atomic Size Factor**: The difference in atomic radii between the solute and solvent atoms must be less than 15%.\n2.  **Crystal Structure**: The solute and solvent must have the same crystal structure.\n3.  **Electronegativity**: The solute and solvent should have similar electronegativities. A large difference promotes the formation of intermetallic compounds instead of solid solutions.\n4.  **Valency**: All other factors being equal, a solvent will have a greater tendency to dissolve a solute of higher valency than one of lower valency. However, for extensive solid solubility, the valencies of the two elements should be as similar as possible.\n\nLet's analyze the Cu-Al and Cu-Ni systems based on these four rules using the provided data.\n\n**Analysis of the Copper-Aluminum (Cu-Al) System**\n\n1.  **Atomic Size Factor**:\n    - Radius of Cu, $R_{\\text{Cu}} = 0.128 \\text{ nm}$\n    - Radius of Al, $R_{\\text{Al}} = 0.143 \\text{ nm}$\n    - The percentage difference in atomic radii is calculated as:\n    $$ \\Delta R \\% = \\frac{|R_{\\text{Al}} - R_{\\text{Cu}}|}{R_{\\text{Cu}}} \\times 100\\% $$\n    $$ \\Delta R \\% = \\frac{|0.143 - 0.128|}{0.128} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.015}{0.128} \\times 100\\% \\approx 11.7\\% $$\n    Since $11.7\\%  15\\%$, this rule is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Crystal Structure**:\n    - Crystal structure of Cu is Face-Centered Cubic (FCC).\n    - Crystal structure of Al is also FCC.\n    - Since both have the same crystal structure, this rule is satisfied.\n\n3.  **Electronegativity**:\n    - Electronegativity of Cu, $EN_{\\text{Cu}} = 1.90$\n    - Electronegativity of Al, $EN_{\\text{Al}} = 1.61$\n    - The difference in electronegativity is $\\Delta EN = |1.61 - 1.90| = 0.29$. This is a relatively small difference, so the rule is considered satisfied, although the similarity is not ideal.\n\n4.  **Valency**:\n    - Valence of Cu is +2.\n    - Valence of Al is +3.\n    - The valencies are different. This disfavors the formation of an extensive solid solution.\n\n**Analysis of the Copper-Nickel (Cu-Ni) System**\n\n1.  **Atomic Size Factor**:\n    - Radius of Cu, $R_{\\text{Cu}} = 0.128 \\text{ nm}$\n    - Radius of Ni, $R_{\\text{Ni}} = 0.125 \\text{ nm}$\n    - The percentage difference in atomic radii is:\n    $$ \\Delta R \\% = \\frac{|R_{\\text{Ni}} - R_{\\text{Cu}}|}{R_{\\text{Cu}}} \\times 100\\% $$\n    $$ \\Delta R \\% = \\frac{|0.125 - 0.128|}{0.128} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.003}{0.128} \\times 100\\% \\approx 2.3\\% $$\n    Since $2.3\\%  15\\%$, this rule is satisfied. The match is significantly better than for Al.\n\n2.  **Crystal Structure**:\n    - Crystal structure of Cu is FCC.\n    - Crystal structure of Ni is also FCC.\n    - This rule is satisfied.\n\n3.  **Electronegativity**:\n    - Electronegativity of Cu, $EN_{\\text{Cu}} = 1.90$\n    - Electronegativity of Ni, $EN_{\\text{Ni}} = 1.91$\n    - The difference in electronegativity is $\\Delta EN = |1.91 - 1.90| = 0.01$. This difference is extremely small, indicating a very high degree of chemical compatibility. The match is nearly perfect.\n\n4.  **Valency**:\n    - Valence of Cu is +2.\n    - Valence of Ni is +2.\n    - The valencies are identical. This is the most favorable condition for forming an extensive solid solution.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's summarize the comparison:\n- **Atomic Radius**: Both Al and Ni satisfy the 15% rule, but Ni's radius ($2.3\\%$ difference) is a much closer match to Cu's than Al's ($11.7\\%$ difference).\n- **Crystal Structure**: Both Al and Ni match Cu's FCC structure. This criterion does not differentiate them.\n- **Electronegativity**: Both have reasonably similar electronegativity to Cu, but Ni's ($0.01$ difference) is almost identical to Cu's, while Al's ($0.29$ difference) is noticeably different.\n- **Valency**: Ni has the same valence as Cu (+2), which is ideal. Al has a different valence (+3), which is unfavorable.\n\nOverall, Nickel (Ni) satisfies all four Hume-Rothery rules far more favorably than Aluminum (Al). The near-perfect match in atomic radius, electronegativity, and valency, in addition to having the same crystal structure, indicates that Cu and Ni should be completely miscible in the solid state, forming a continuous solid solution. While Al shows some solubility in Cu, the less favorable matches in radius, electronegativity, and valency mean it will not form as extensive a solid solution as Ni. Therefore, nickel is the more suitable candidate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1305604"}, {"introduction": "In materials science, we often think about alloy design in terms of atomic ratios, but in the laboratory or factory, we measure ingredients by mass.
