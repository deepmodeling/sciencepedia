By intentionally introducing specific antisite defects, we can control the type and concentration of charge carriers. This practice [@problem_id:1281723] explores a classic example—an aluminum atom in a silicon lattice—to help you understand the physical mechanism by which an antisite defect can create a 'hole' and turn an intrinsic semiconductor into a p-type semiconductor.", "problem": "In semiconductor manufacturing, the electronic properties of a material like crystalline silicon (Si) are precisely controlled by introducing specific impurity atoms, a process known as doping. An antisite defect occurs when an atom of one type occupies a lattice site normally reserved for an atom of another type.\n\nConsider a single crystal of pure silicon, where each Si atom (a Group 14 element with 4 valence electrons) is covalently bonded to four neighboring Si atoms. An antisite defect is created by replacing one Si atom with an aluminum (Al) atom (a Group 13 element with 3 valence electrons).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical explanation for why this Al$_{\\text{Si}}$ antisite defect acts as a p-type acceptor in the silicon lattice?\n\nA. The aluminum atom has 5 valence electrons. It donates its extra electron to the silicon conduction band, creating a free negative charge carrier and thus acting as an n-type donor.\n\nB. The aluminum atom is smaller than the silicon atom, and this size mismatch creates a local potential well that traps electrons from the valence band, generating mobile holes.\n\nC. The aluminum atom has 3 valence electrons. The atom itself gains a net positive charge and becomes a mobile ion, which is the positive charge carrier responsible for p-type conductivity.\n\nD. The aluminum atom has 3 valence electrons, one fewer than silicon's 4. It accepts an electron from the silicon valence band to complete its covalent bonding, creating a mobile hole in the valence band. This makes it a p-type acceptor.\n\nE. The aluminum atom has 3 valence electrons. To satisfy its bonding environment, it generates a hole in the conduction band, which acts as a mobile positive charge carrier.", "solution": "We start from the covalent bonding picture of the diamond lattice. Each Si atom forms four covalent bonds, requiring two electrons per bond. A Si atom, with 4 valence electrons, contributes one electron to each of its four bonds, so all bonds are filled.\n\nWhen a Si atom is replaced by an Al atom, the Al has 3 valence electrons. In the simple electron-counting picture, there is a deficiency of one electron to fill the four bonds around the Al site. This missing electron corresponds to an empty state that can accept an electron; thus, the substitutional Al on a Si site, denoted Al$_{\\text{Si}}$, acts as an acceptor.\n\nIn the band picture, this corresponds to the formation of an acceptor level at an energy $E_{A}$ slightly above the valence band maximum $E_{v}$. Thermal excitation transfers an electron from the valence band to the acceptor level with probability scaling as $\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{A}-E_{v}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$. When an electron from the valence band is captured by Al$_{\\text{Si}}$, the defect becomes negatively charged (denoted $A^{-}$), and a hole is left in the valence band. The hole is a mobile positive charge carrier in the valence band, leading to p-type conductivity. Charge neutrality in a p-type semiconductor reflects this via\n$$\np + N_{D}^{+} = n + N_{A}^{-},\n$$\nwith $N_{A}^{-}$ the ionized acceptors; in the nondegenerate p-type limit with negligible donors, $p \\approx N_{A}^{-}$.\n\nEvaluate the options against this physics:\n- Option A is incorrect because Al does not have 5 valence electrons and does not donate electrons to the conduction band; it has 3 valence electrons and acts as an acceptor, not a donor.\n- Option B is incorrect because the dominant mechanism for acceptor behavior is valence electron deficiency creating an acceptor level near $E_{v}$, not size mismatch or a generic potential well responsible for trapping conduction.\n- Option C is incorrect because while the ionized acceptor carries a negative charge after capturing an electron, the impurity ion is fixed on a lattice site and does not move; conduction arises from mobile holes in the valence band, not from motion of impurity ions.\n- Option D correctly states that Al has one fewer valence electron than Si, accepts an electron from the valence band to complete covalent bonding, and thereby creates a mobile hole in the valence band, yielding p-type behavior.\n- Option E is incorrect because holes are defined as the absence of electrons in the valence band, not in the conduction band.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1281723"}, {"introduction": "The presence of antisite defects has a direct and measurable impact on the macroscopic properties of a crystal, such as its density.
