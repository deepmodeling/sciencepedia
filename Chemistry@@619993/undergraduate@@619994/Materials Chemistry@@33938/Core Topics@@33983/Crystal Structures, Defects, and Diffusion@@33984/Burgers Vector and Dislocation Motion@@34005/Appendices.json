Because a dislocation's strain energy is proportional to the square of its Burgers vector's magnitude, slip is most common for dislocations with the shortest possible Burgers vector. This first practice problem allows you to derive this fundamental quantity from first principles for a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal, connecting the abstract concept of a dislocation to the tangible geometry of the atomic lattice. [@problem_id:1287423]", "problem": "In materials science, the plastic deformation of crystalline solids is primarily governed by the motion of line defects known as dislocations. The character of a dislocation is described by its Burgers vector, $\\vec{b}$, which represents the magnitude and direction of the lattice distortion. For many metals, the slip process (the movement of dislocations) occurs most readily for dislocations whose Burgers vector corresponds to the shortest possible lattice translation vector, as this minimizes the required strain energy.\n\nConsider a metal that crystallizes in the Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure, which is common for metals like iron, chromium, and tungsten at room temperature. The BCC unit cell can be visualized as a cube with atoms at each of the 8 corners and one atom at the geometric center of the cube. Let the lattice constant, which is the edge length of this cubic unit cell, be denoted by $a$.\n\nAssuming that the Burgers vector for the primary slip system in this BCC metal corresponds to the shortest vector that connects two equivalent atom positions in the lattice, determine the magnitude of this Burgers vector. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the lattice constant $a$.", "solution": "In a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Bravais lattice, the lattice points in the conventional cubic cell of edge length $a$ are at fractional coordinates $(0,0,0)$ (corners) and $\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ (body center). A valid lattice translation vector must map a lattice point to another lattice point.\n\nThe shortest nonzero translation that satisfies this condition connects a corner to the body center.
