The fundamental building block is the $[\\text{SiO}_4]$ tetrahedron, consisting of one central silicon atom covalently bonded to four oxygen atoms. In a class of materials known as tectosilicates, which includes crystalline quartz and idealized amorphous silicate glass, these tetrahedra are linked together to form a continuous three-dimensional framework. The defining characteristic of this ideal framework is that every oxygen atom acts as a bridging atom, meaning it is corner-shared between exactly two adjacent $[\\text{SiO}_4]$ tetrahedra.

To create most commercial glasses, manufacturers add \"network modifiers\" like soda ($\\text{Na}_2\\text{O}$) and lime ($\\text{CaO}$), which disrupt the perfectly connected network and lower the processing temperature. This practice [@problem_id:1332251] will guide you through calculating the number of \"non-bridging oxygens\" created by these modifiers, a key structural parameter that directly correlates with a glass's viscosity, durability, and other macroscopic properties.", "problem": "In the structure of amorphous materials like silicate glasses, silicon atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated to four oxygen atoms. These oxygen atoms can be classified into two types. A bridging oxygen (BO) is an oxygen atom that links two silicon tetrahedra by forming Si-O-Si bonds. A non-bridging oxygen (NBO) is an oxygen atom bonded to only a single silicon atom, with its negative charge balanced by a nearby metal cation. These cations, such as $Na^+$ and $Ca^{2+}$, originate from metal oxides (e.g., $\\text{Na}_2\\text{O}$, $\\text{CaO}$) added to the silica ($\\text{SiO}_2$) melt and are known as network modifiers, as they disrupt the continuous Si-O-Si network.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a soda-lime-silica glass, which has a molar composition represented by the formula $\\text{Na}_2\\text{O} \\cdot \\text{CaO} \\cdot 6\\text{SiO}_2$.

In this network, each silicon ion has an oxidation state of +4 and each oxygen ion has an oxidation state of -2.\n\nTo enhance the glass's properties, the composition is modified in a two-step process. First, a certain fraction of the silicon ($Si^{4+}$) ions in the tetrahedral sites are substituted with aluminum ($Al^{3+}$) ions.

The oxygen framework remains the same, so each substitution introduces a net charge deficit of $-1$ that must be compensated by extra cations. Each $Ca^{2+}$ contributes $+2$ charge. Charge neutrality therefore requires\n$$\n2N_{\\text{Ca}}=N_{\\text{Al}}.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\n\\frac{N_{\\text{Ca}}}{N_{\\text{Al}}}=\\frac{1}{2}=0.5.\n$$\nThe fraction $x=0.12$ cancels in the ratio, confirming that the required atomic ratio $\\text{Ca}:\\text{Al}$ is fixed by charge balance alone.
