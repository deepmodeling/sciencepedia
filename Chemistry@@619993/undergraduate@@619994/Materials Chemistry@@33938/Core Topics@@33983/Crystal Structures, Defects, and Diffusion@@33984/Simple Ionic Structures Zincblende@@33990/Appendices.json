The structure can be described as a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice of sulfide anions with zinc cations occupying half of the available tetrahedral interstitial sites.

In zincblende ZnS, the $\\text{S}^{2-}$ anions form an FCC lattice and the $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ cations occupy half of the tetrahedral interstitial sites. A Frenkel defect consists of an ion leaving its regular lattice site and moving to an interstitial site, producing a vacancy-interstitial pair.\n\nTo decide whether a cation or an anion Frenkel defect is more favorable, we compare the sizes of the ions to the available interstitial sites and assess the associated lattice distortion (elastic strain) energy.

The energy cost for placing an ion into an interstitial is dominated by short-range repulsions and elastic strain, which increase strongly with the size mismatch between the ion and the cavity. Because $r_{\\text{Zn}^{2+}}$ is much smaller than $r_{\\text{S}^{2-}}$, moving a $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ from its normal site into a nearby interstitial site produces significantly less lattice distortion than attempting to place the much larger $\\text{S}^{2-}$ anion into an interstitial site. Consequently, the formation energy for a cation Frenkel defect is lower than for an anion Frenkel defect.\n\nAlternative explanations in the options can be evaluated. The idea that a lower effective nuclear charge of $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ would increase mobility is incorrect in this context; defect formation is governed primarily by size and resulting lattice strain rather than such atomic-structure considerations. The fact that $\\text{S}^{2-}$ forms the primary FCC lattice does not make it more likely to be displaced; in fact, its larger size and strong packing make interstitial accommodation highly unfavorable. The assertion that both defect types are equally likely contradicts the size-dependent strain argument above.\n\nTherefore, the predominant Frenkel defect in ZnS is the cation Frenkel defect, primarily because the smaller $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ cation can occupy an interstitial site with much less lattice distortion and lower energy cost than the larger $\\text{S}^{2-}$ anion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1333556"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand why certain defects dominate in a crystal, we must go beyond qualitative arguments and analyze their formation energies.

The steric energy is considered non-zero only if the sum of the ionic radii of two adjacent ions is greater than their separation distance.
