(8, 8, 8)", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the number of Na$^+$ ions, S$^{2-}$ ions, and Na$_2$S formula units within a single unit cell based on its crystallographic description.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of sulfide ions (S$^{2-}$) per unit cell. The problem states that the S$^{2-}$ ions form a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice. An FCC lattice has lattice points at the 8 corners and on the 6 faces of the cubic unit cell.\nAn ion located at a corner of the cube is shared by 8 adjacent unit cells, so it contributes only $\\frac{1}{8}$ of an ion to the cell.\nAn ion located on a face of the cube is shared by 2 adjacent unit cells, so it contributes $\\frac{1}{2}$ of an ion to the cell.\nThe total number of S$^{2-}$ ions in one unit cell is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ \\text{Number of S}^{2-} \\text{ ions} = \\left(8 \\text{ corners} \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\frac{\\text{ion}}{\\text{corner}}\\right) + \\left(6 \\text{ faces} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\text{ion}}{\\text{face}}\\right) = 1 + 3 = 4 $$\nTherefore, there are 4 sulfide ions per unit cell.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of sodium ions (Na$^+$) per unit cell. The problem states that the Na$^+$ ions occupy all the tetrahedral interstitial sites. A fundamental property of the FCC lattice is that it contains 8 tetrahedral sites. These sites are located entirely within the interior of the unit cell, meaning they are not shared with any other cells. Thus, an ion in a tetrahedral site contributes a full count of 1 to the unit cell.\nSince all 8 tetrahedral sites are occupied by Na$^+$ ions:\n$$ \\text{Number of Na}^{+} \\text{ ions} = 8 \\text{ sites} \\times 1 \\frac{\\text{ion}}{\\text{site}} = 8 $$\nTherefore, there are 8 sodium ions per unit cell.\n\nFinally, we determine the number of formula units of Na$_2$S. A single formula unit of sodium sulfide consists of 2 Na$^+$ ions and 1 S$^{2-}$ ion. From our calculations, the unit cell contains a total of 8 Na$^+$ ions and 4 S$^{2-}$ ions. We can find the number of formula units by dividing the total number of ions of one type in the cell by the number of that ion in one formula unit.\nUsing the sulfide ions:\n$$ \\text{Number of formula units} = \\frac{\\text{Total S}^{2-} \\text{ ions in cell}}{\\text{S}^{2-} \\text{ ions per formula unit}} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4 $$\nAs a check, we can use the sodium ions:\n$$ \\text{Number of formula units} = \\frac{\\text{Total Na}^{+} \\text{ ions in cell}}{\\text{Na}^{+} \\text{ ions per formula unit}} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 $$\nBoth calculations confirm that there are 4 formula units of Na$_2$S per unit cell.\n\nThe resulting triplet is (Number of Na$^+$ ions, Number of S$^{2-}$ ions, Number of formula units), which corresponds to (8, 4, 4).
