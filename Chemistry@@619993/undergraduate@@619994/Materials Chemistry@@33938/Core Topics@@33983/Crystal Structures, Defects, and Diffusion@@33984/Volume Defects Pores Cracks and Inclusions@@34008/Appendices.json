According to linear elastic fracture mechanics, specifically the Griffith criterion, the fracture stress $\\sigma_{f}$ for a material containing a through-thickness crack of length $2a$ is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{f} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G_{c}}{\\pi a}}\n$$\nwhere $G_{c}$ is the critical strain energy release rate, or fracture toughness, a material constant. The crucial part of this model is that $a$ represents the half-length of the crack that is oriented perpendicular to the direction of the applied tensile stress. We will apply this criterion to the two different loading orientations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where the stress is applied perpendicular to the alignment of the cracks. The tensile strength in this orientation is denoted by $\\sigma_{\\perp}$. In this scenario, the tensile force is perpendicular to the semi-major axes of the elliptical cracks. Therefore, the dimension of the crack that is perpendicular to the stress is its longest dimension, the major axis, which has a full length of $2c$. In the context of the Griffith equation, the effective half-crack length $a$ is equal to the semi-major axis $c$.\nThus, the tensile strength for the perpendicular orientation is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\perp} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G_{c}}{\\pi c}}\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the case where the stress is applied parallel to the alignment of the cracks. The tensile strength in this orientation is denoted by $\\sigma_{\\parallel}$. Here, the tensile force is parallel to the semi-major axes of the cracks. The dimension of the crack that is perpendicular to this stress is its shortest dimension, the minor axis, which has a full length of $2b$. In this case, the effective half-crack length $a$ in the Griffith equation is equal to the semi-minor axis $b$.\nThus, the tensile strength for the parallel orientation is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\parallel} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G_{c}}{\\pi b}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we need to find the ratio $\\frac{\\sigma_{\\parallel}}{\\sigma_{\\perp}}$.
