The interfaces where these grains meet are called grain boundaries. Due to the less-than-perfect atomic arrangement at these interfaces, grain boundaries possess an excess energy per unit area, denoted as $\\gamma_{gb}$. This grain boundary energy can be conceptualized as a two-dimensional analog of surface tension. In a process called annealing, a polycrystalline material is heated to allow its microstructure to evolve towards a lower-energy state, which involves changes in the shape and arrangement of the grains.\n\nConsider a well-annealed, single-phase polycrystalline material. We can assume this material is isotropic, meaning the grain boundary energy, $\\gamma_{gb}$, is constant and independent of the orientation of the boundary.
