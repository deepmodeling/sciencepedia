We are given the equations for the boundaries of a simplified Pourbaix diagram that divides the potential-pH space into three regions, each corresponding to a dominant species: Ni (immunity), Ni$^{2+}$ (corrosion), and Ni(OH)$_2$ (passivation). To solve the problem, we must determine which region the point (pH = 2.0, $E = 0.0$ V) lies in by comparing its coordinates to the given boundary equations.\n\nFirst, we consider the Immunity-Corrosion Boundary, which separates the Ni and Ni$^{2+}$ regions. This boundary is defined by the horizontal line at a constant potential of $E = -0.428$ V. The problem states that below this potential, Ni is stable, and above it, Ni$^{2+}$ is stable. The given potential is $E = 0.0$ V. Since $0.0 \\text{ V} \\gt -0.428 \\text{ V}$, the system's potential is above this boundary line. This means the system is not in the region of immunity where metallic Ni is the dominant species. Thus, we can eliminate option A.\n\nNext, we consider the Corrosion-Passivation Boundary, which separates the Ni$^{2+}$ and Ni(OH)$_2$ regions. This boundary is defined by the vertical line at a constant pH of 9.15. The problem states that to the left of this line (lower pH), Ni$^{2+}$ is stable, and to the right (higher pH), Ni(OH)$_2$ is stable. The given pH is 2.0. Since $\\text{pH} = 2.0 \\lt 9.15$, the system's pH is to the left of this boundary line. This means the system is not in the region of passivation where solid Ni(OH)$_2$ is the dominant species. Thus, we can eliminate option C.\n\nThe point (pH = 2.0, $E = 0.0$ V) is located in the region where the potential is greater than -0.428 V and the pH is less than 9.15. This area of the Pourbaix diagram corresponds to the region of active corrosion, where the dominant species is the dissolved nickel(II) ion, Ni$^{2+}$.\n\nThe third boundary, the Immunity-Passivation Boundary ($E = 0.126 - 0.0592 \\times \\text{pH}$), separates the Ni and Ni(OH)$_2$ regions. Our analysis has already shown that the state point is not in either of these regions, so it must be in the Ni$^{2+}$ region they enclose. This boundary is not needed to locate the point but confirms the structure of the diagram. The combination of our two checks is sufficient to uniquely identify the correct region.\n\nOption D, NiO, is another known oxide of nickel, but it is not included as a possible species in the simplified model provided in the problem statement. Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer within the context of this problem.\n\nBased on the analysis, the conditions pH = 2.0 and $E = 0.0$ V fall squarely within the region of stability for the Ni$^{2+}$ ion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1326929"}, {"introduction": "Real-world materials are often subjected to changing environmental conditions, not static ones.

The stability of zinc in an aqueous solution is described by a Pourbaix diagram (Potential vs. pH). For the specific conditions of interest (25 °C, 1 atm, and an effective zinc ion activity of $10^{-6}$ M for corrosion boundaries), a simplified version of the diagram reveals the following distinct regions of thermodynamic stability:\n\n1.  **Immunity Region**: For any pH, if the electrochemical potential is below approximately -0.90 V, the metallic zinc (Zn) is thermodynamically stable and does not corrode.\n2.  **Corrosion Region I**: For pH values less than 8.5 and potentials above the immunity region, zinc corrodes to form soluble zinc ions ($Zn^{2+}$).\n3.  **Passivity Region**: For pH values between 8.5 and 11.0, and potentials above the immunity region, zinc forms a stable, solid passive film of zinc hydroxide ($Zn(OH)_2$), which protects the underlying metal from further corrosion.\n4.  **Corrosion Region II**: For pH values greater than 11.0 and potentials above the immunity region, the passive film is unstable and dissolves to form soluble zincate ions ($[\\text{ZnO}_2]^{2-}$), resulting in corrosion.\n\nInitially, the zinc component is placed in a solution with a pH of 4.0. The electrochemical potential of the zinc is then set and held constant at -0.50 V relative to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). Subsequently, a chemical process is used to slowly raise the pH of the solution from 4.0 to 12.0, while the potential remains fixed.\n\nBased on the provided description of zinc's behavior, determine the sequence of states (Immunity, Passivity, Corrosion) that the zinc component undergoes as the pH of the solution is changed from 4.0 to 12.0.\n\nA.

First, compare the fixed potential to the immunity threshold: since $-0.50\\ \\mathrm{V} \\gt -0.90\\ \\mathrm{V}$, the potential is always above the immunity region for all pH. Therefore, as pH varies, the system will not enter immunity at any point.\n\nNext, map the pH trajectory at fixed potential to the regions defined above:\n- Initially at $\\text{pH}=4.0$ with $E=-0.50\\ \\mathrm{V}$, we have $\\text{pH} \\lt 8.5$ and $E$ above the immunity threshold, so the system is in Corrosion Region I, producing soluble $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$.\n- As the pH increases into the range $8.5 \\le \\text{pH} \\le 11.0$ at the same fixed $E$, the region changes to Passivity, forming a stable $\\mathrm{Zn(OH)}_{2}$ film.\n- When the pH exceeds $11.0$, still at the same fixed $E$, the region changes to Corrosion Region II, forming soluble $\\left[\\mathrm{ZnO}_{2}\\right]^{2-}$.\n\nThus, as the pH is raised from $4.0$ to $12.0$ at $E=-0.50\\ \\mathrm{V}$, the sequence of states is Corrosion, then Passivity, then Corrosion, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1326915"}, {"introduction": "Pourbaix diagrams are powerful predictive tools, but they are not universal; they represent a system under a specific set of conditions, most notably the concentration of dissolved ions.
