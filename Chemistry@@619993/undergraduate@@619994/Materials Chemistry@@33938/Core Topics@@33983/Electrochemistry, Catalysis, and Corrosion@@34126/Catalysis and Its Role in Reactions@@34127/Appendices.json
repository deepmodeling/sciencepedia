Which of the following statements most accurately predicts and explains the difference in the initial rate of production of compound Y between the two reactors?\n\nA. Catalyst A will have a higher reaction rate because its smooth, uniform surface allows for more ordered and efficient adsorption of reactant molecules.\n\nB. Catalyst B will have a higher reaction rate because its porous structure provides a much larger total surface area, and therefore a much greater number of active sites for the reaction to occur.\n\nC. Both catalysts will have the same reaction rate because they have the same mass and chemical composition, meaning they contain the same total number of catalytically active atoms.\n\nD. Catalyst B will have a higher reaction rate because the small pores can trap reactant molecules, significantly increasing their local concentration near the active sites compared to the bulk gas phase.\n\nE.
