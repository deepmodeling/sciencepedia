The iron pipe will corrode preferentially. Iron has a more negative standard reduction potential than copper, causing it to act as the anode in the resulting galvanic cell.\nB. The copper pipe will corrode preferentially. Copper has a more positive standard reduction potential than iron, causing it to act as the anode in the resulting galvanic cell.\nC. Both pipes will corrode, but the copper pipe will corrode faster because it is a more reactive metal than iron.\nD. Neither pipe will corrode because the direct metal-to-metal contact creates a protective electrical circuit that prevents oxidation.\nE. Both pipes will corrode at roughly the same rate, determined primarily by the pH and oxygen content of the water, rather than the contact between the two metals.", "solution": "When two dissimilar metals are in direct electrical contact and immersed in an electrolyte, they form a galvanic cell.

Statements B and C incorrectly identify copper as the corroding metal. Statement D is incorrect because electrical contact in an electrolyte drives galvanic corrosion rather than preventing it.

This exercise [@problem_id:1315975] challenges you to analyze the fate of steel protected by two different coatings—zinc and tin—once the underlying steel is exposed. You will apply your knowledge of the galvanic series to determine whether the coating provides sacrificial protection or inadvertently accelerates the corrosion of the steel it was meant to protect.", "problem": "A materials engineer is tasked with selecting a protective metallic coating for a steel housing intended for a sensor deployed in a coastal marine environment. The environment is highly corrosive due to the presence of saltwater and oxygen. The primary concern is that any minor scratches or damage to the coating during deployment or service could expose the underlying steel, potentially leading to catastrophic failure of the housing due to rust (the corrosion of iron).\n\nTwo candidate coatings are being considered: zinc (a process known as galvanizing) and tin. To make an informed decision, the engineer analyzes the electrochemical behavior of the systems. Consider the following standard reduction potentials at 25°C:\n\n- $Fe^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Fe(s), E^{\\circ} = -0.44 \\text{ V}$\n- $Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Zn(s), E^{\\circ} = -0.76 \\text{ V}$\n- $Sn^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Sn(s), E^{\\circ} = -0.14 \\text{ V}$\n\nAssuming a scratch exposes the steel (primarily iron) to the corrosive environment, which of the following statements correctly explains the corrosion behavior and provides the best recommendation for protecting the steel housing?\n\nA. A tin coating is superior. In a scratched region, the more noble tin acts as a sacrificial anode, corroding preferentially to protect the steel cathode.\nB. A zinc coating is superior. In a scratched region, the more active zinc acts as a sacrificial anode, corroding preferentially to protect the steel cathode.\nC. A tin coating is superior. Tin is harder and more resistant to physical scratches than zinc, and it forms a more passive oxide layer that physically blocks the steel from the environment. The electrochemical effects are negligible.\nD. A zinc coating is superior. In a scratched region, the less active zinc acts as the cathode, forcing the more active steel to become a sacrificial anode, thereby passivating the steel surface.\nE. Both coatings are equally effective. In both cases, the coating acts as a physical barrier. Once scratched, the exposed steel will rust at the same rate regardless of the coating material.", "solution": "In a galvanic couple formed by two different metals in an electrolyte (like at a scratch), the metal with the lower (more negative) standard reduction potential ($E^{\\circ}$) is more active and will act as the anode, corroding preferentially.

Since zinc is more active than iron ($E^{\\circ}_{\\text{Zn}}  E^{\\circ}_{\\text{Fe}}$), zinc will act as the sacrificial anode and corrode. The iron is forced to be the cathode and is cathodically protected from rusting.\n\n**Case 2: Tin-coated steel**\nAt a scratch, a tin-iron couple is formed.

Tin accelerates iron's corrosion.\n- D is false: Zinc is the anode, not the cathode, in the couple with steel.\n- E is false: The coating material has a dramatic effect on the corrosion rate at a scratch due to galvanic coupling.\n\nHence, the correct recommendation is zinc coating (galvanizing), because it provides sacrificial protection in scratched regions in a marine environment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1315975"}, {"introduction": "Effective corrosion control requires moving beyond thermodynamic predictions to understanding the kinetics of the electrochemical reactions. This advanced practice introduces a quantitative model based on Tafel kinetics to investigate the dangerous consequences of misusing an anodic inhibitor [@problem_id:1315914].

Later, an insufficient quantity of a passivating (anodic) inhibitor is added to the solution. This inhibitor successfully passivates 99.9% of the original anodic surface, rendering it electrochemically inert. However, the remaining 0.1% of the original anodic surface area continues to corrode actively, following the same Tafel law as before. The total cathodic surface area and its electrochemical behavior remain completely unchanged.\n\nCalculate the factor by which the local current density at these remaining active anodic sites increases compared to the initial, uniform corrosion current density. This factor quantifies the intensification of localized corrosion due to the under-dosing of the inhibitor. Express your answer as a dimensionless ratio, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the new, localized anodic current density to the initial, uniform corrosion current density. We will solve this in two parts: first, find the initial corrosion current density, and second, find the new localized anodic current density under the effect of the under-dosed inhibitor.\n\n**Part 1: Initial Corrosion State**\n\nIn any corrosion process, the total anodic current ($I_a$) must equal the magnitude of the total cathodic current ($|I_c|$). The potential of the metal stabilizes at the corrosion potential, $E_{corr}$, where the rates of the anodic and cathodic reactions are equal.\nTotal current is the product of current density ($i$) and area ($A$). Thus, the balance equation is:\n$$I_a = |I_c| \\implies i_a A_a = |i_c| A_c$$\nInitially, the problem states that the anodic and cathodic areas are equal, $A_a = A_c$. Therefore, the current densities must also be equal. Let's call this the initial corrosion current density, $i_{corr,0}$.\n$$i_a = |i_c| = i_{corr,0}$$\nAt the corrosion potential, $E_{corr,0}$, the potentials of the anodic and cathodic reactions are equal. Using the given Tafel equations:\n$$E_{a,0} + \\beta_a \\log_{10}(i_{corr,0}) = E_{c,0} - \\beta_c \\log_{10}(i_{corr,0})$$\nWe can solve for $\\log_{10}(i_{corr,0})$:\n$$(\\beta_a + \\beta_c) \\log_{10}(i_{corr,0}) = E_{c,0} - E_{a,0}$$\n$$\\log_{10}(i_{corr,0}) = \\frac{E_{c,0} - E_{a,0}}{\\beta_a + \\beta_c}$$\nThis equation defines the logarithm of the initial corrosion current density. We will keep it in this form for now.\n\n**Part 2: Corrosion State with Under-dosed Inhibitor**\n\nAfter adding the inhibitor, the situation changes. Let the initial anodic area be $A_{a,0}$. The new active anodic area, $A'_a$, is 0.1% of the original:\n$$A'_a = 0.001 A_{a,0}$$\nThe cathodic area remains unchanged. Since we initially had $A_{a,0} = A_{c,0}$, the new cathodic area is $A'_c = A_{c,0} = A_{a,0}$.\n\nThe corrosion process now establishes a new equilibrium at a new corrosion potential, $E'_{corr}$. The total current balance must still hold:\n$$I'_a = |I'_c| \\implies i'_a A'_a = |i'_c| A'_c$$\nHere, $i'_a$ is the new local current density at the small active anodic sites (the \"pits\"), and $i'_c$ is the new current density at the cathodic sites.\nSubstituting the area expressions:\n$$i'_a (0.001 A_{a,0}) = |i'_c| (A_{a,0})$$\nThis simplifies to a relationship between the new current densities:\n$$|i'_c| = 0.001 i'_a$$\nAt the new corrosion potential $E'_{corr}$, the potentials given by the Tafel equations must again be equal:\n$$E_{a,0} + \\beta_a \\log_{10}(i'_a) = E_{c,0} - \\beta_c \\log_{10}(|i'_c|)$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship $|i'_c| = 0.001 i'_a$ into this equation:\n$$E_{a,0} + \\beta_a \\log_{10}(i'_a) = E_{c,0} - \\beta_c \\log_{10}(0.001 i'_a)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log(xy) = \\log(x) + \\log(y)$:\n$$E_{a,0} + \\beta_a \\log_{10}(i'_a) = E_{c,0} - \\beta_c (\\log_{10}(0.001) + \\log_{10}(i'_a))$$\nSince $\\log_{10}(0.001) = \\log_{10}(10^{-3}) = -3$:\n$$E_{a,0} + \\beta_a \\log_{10}(i'_a) = E_{c,0} - \\beta_c (-3 + \\log_{10}(i'_a))$$\n$$E_{a,0} + \\beta_a \\log_{10}(i'_a) = E_{c,0} + 3\\beta_c - \\beta_c \\log_{10}(i'_a)$$\nNow, we solve for $\\log_{10}(i'_a)$, which represents the logarithm of the local anodic current density in the pits:\n$$(\\beta_a + \\beta_c) \\log_{10}(i'_a) = E_{c,0} - E_{a,0} + 3\\beta_c$$\n$$\\log_{10}(i'_a) = \\frac{E_{c,0} - E_{a,0} + 3\\beta_c}{\\beta_a + \\beta_c}$$\nLet's call this new localized anodic current density $i_{pitting} = i'_a$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculating the Ratio**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{i_{pitting}}{i_{corr,0}}$. Taking the expressions for their logarithms:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{i_{pitting}}{i_{corr,0}}\\right) = \\log_{10}(i_{pitting}) - \\log_{10}(i_{corr,0})$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{i_{pitting}}{i_{corr,0}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{E_{c,0} - E_{a,0} + 3\\beta_c}{\\beta_a + \\beta_c}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{E_{c,0} - E_{a,0}}{\\beta_a + \\beta_c}\\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{i_{pitting}}{i_{corr,0}}\\right) = \\frac{(E_{c,0} - E_{a,0} + 3\\beta_c) - (E_{c,0} - E_{a,0})}{\\beta_a + \\beta_c}$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{i_{pitting}}{i_{corr,0}}\\right) = \\frac{3\\beta_c}{\\beta_a + \\beta_c}$$\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{i_{pitting}}{i_{corr,0}} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{3\\beta_c}{\\beta_a + \\beta_c}\\right)}$$\nThis remarkably simple result shows that the intensification factor depends only on the Tafel slopes and the degree to which the anodic area is reduced (which introduced the factor of 3 in the exponent, from $\\log_{10}(10^{-3})$).\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values given in the problem:\n$\\beta_a = 0.070 \\text{ V/decade}$\n$\\beta_c = 0.110 \\text{ V/decade}$\n$$\\text{Ratio} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{3 \\times 0.110}{0.070 + 0.110}\\right)} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{0.330}{0.180}\\right)} = 10^{\\frac{11}{6}}$$\n$$\\text{Ratio} = 10^{1.8333...} \\approx 68.1292$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the ratio is 68.1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{68.1}$$", "id": "1315914"}]}
