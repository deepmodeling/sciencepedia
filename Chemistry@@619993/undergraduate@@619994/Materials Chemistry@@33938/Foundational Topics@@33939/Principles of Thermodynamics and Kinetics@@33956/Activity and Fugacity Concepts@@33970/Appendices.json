By analyzing a thought experiment on the solubility of benzene in water [@problem_id:1280716], you will explore the relationship between phase equilibrium, activity, and the activity coefficient. This practice builds a deeper, qualitative understanding of how molecular interactions in a non-ideal solution influence a substance's \"effective concentration\" and its tendency to partition between phases, a phenomenon known as \"salting out.\"", "problem": "Consider a system at a constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. Initially, the system consists of two phases in equilibrium: a pure liquid benzene phase and a saturated aqueous solution of benzene. In this initial state, the mole fraction of benzene in the aqueous solution (its solubility) is $x_1$, and its activity coefficient, which quantifies deviations from ideal solution behavior, is $\\gamma_1$.\n\nAn experiment is performed where a significant amount of sodium chloride (NaCl), a salt that is effectively insoluble in benzene, is dissolved into the aqueous phase. The system is allowed to reach a new equilibrium state at the same temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. It is observed that the solubility of benzene in the now saline aqueous solution is lower than in pure water. This new equilibrium solubility is denoted by the mole fraction $x_2$, and the new activity coefficient of benzene is $\\gamma_2$.

When two or more phases are in equilibrium, the chemical potential of any given component must be the same in every phase in which it is present. In this system, benzene is present in both the pure liquid phase and the aqueous solution phase.\n\nLet $\\mu_{benzene}^{(l)}$ be the chemical potential of benzene in the pure liquid phase and $\\mu_{benzene}^{(aq)}$ be the chemical potential of benzene dissolved in the aqueous phase. At equilibrium, we must have:\n$$\n\\mu_{benzene}^{(l)} = \\mu_{benzene}^{(aq)}\n$$\n\nThe chemical potential of a component $i$ in a mixture is related to its activity $a_i$ by the equation:\n$$\n\\mu_i = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + RT \\ln(a_i)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_i^{\\circ}$ is the standard state chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nApplying this to our equilibrium condition:\n$$\n\\mu_{benzene}^{\\circ(l)} + RT \\ln(a_{benzene}^{(l)}) = \\mu_{benzene}^{\\circ(aq)} + RT \\ln(a_{benzene}^{(aq)})\n$$\n\nBy convention, the standard state for a pure liquid at a given temperature and pressure is the pure liquid itself at that same temperature and pressure. Therefore, the activity of benzene in its pure liquid phase, $a_{benzene}^{(l)}$, is equal to 1.\nAlso, the standard state chemical potentials $\\mu_{benzene}^{\\circ(l)}$ and $\\mu_{benzene}^{\\circ(aq)}$ refer to the same standard state (pure liquid benzene), so they are equal. The equilibrium condition simplifies to the equality of activities:\n$$\na_{benzene}^{(l)} = a_{benzene}^{(aq)}\n$$\n$$\n1 = a_{benzene}^{(aq)}\n$$\nThis crucial result means that for any solution that is saturated with benzene and in equilibrium with a pure liquid benzene phase, the activity of benzene in that solution must be equal to 1.\n\nNow, we can apply this result to the two scenarios described in the problem.\n\n**Initial State (Saturated solution in pure water):**\nThe activity of benzene in the aqueous phase, $a_1$, is given by the product of its activity coefficient, $\\gamma_1$, and its mole fraction, $x_1$.

Therefore, the activity of benzene in the saline solution, $a_2$, must also be 1.\n$$\na_2 = \\gamma_2 x_2 = 1\n$$\nThis gives the new solubility:\n$$\nx_2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_2}\n$$\n\nThe problem states the experimental observation that the solubility of benzene decreases upon adding salt, which means $x_2 < x_1$.\nWe can substitute our expressions for $x_1$ and $x_2$ into this inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2} < \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1}\n$$\n\nSince activity coefficients are positive quantities, we can take the reciprocal of both sides of the inequality. Doing so reverses the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\gamma_2 > \\gamma_1\n$$\n\nThis result indicates that adding NaCl to the water increases the activity coefficient of the dissolved benzene. This phenomenon is known as \"salting out.\" The presence of ions from the salt organizes the water molecules into hydration shells, making the dissolution of a non-polar molecule like benzene energetically less favorable. This increased \"effective concentration\" or tendency to escape the solution is captured by the increase in the activity coefficient.\n\nThus, the correct relationship is $\\gamma_2 > \\gamma_1$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1280716"}, {"introduction": "This advanced practice demonstrates the predictive power of thermodynamics by introducing one of its most elegant and useful relationships, the Gibbs-Duhem equation.
