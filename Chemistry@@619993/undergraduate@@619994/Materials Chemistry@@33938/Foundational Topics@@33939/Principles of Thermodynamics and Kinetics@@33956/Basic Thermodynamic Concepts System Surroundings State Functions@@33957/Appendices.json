Thermodynamic properties are classified into two fundamental types: intensive and extensive. This exercise challenges you to apply these definitions in a practical materials engineering context—the injection molding of a polymer—helping you distinguish properties that depend on the amount of material from those that do not [@problem_id:1284942]. Mastering this distinction is the first step toward building scalable models of material behavior.", "problem": "A materials engineer is commissioning a new injection molding machine. For a quality control test, a specific grade of amorphous polycarbonate is melted and injected into a mold to create a batch of identical small gears. The engineer measures or considers several properties of the polymer sample (referred to as a \"shot\") during this process. These properties are:\n\n(i) The total volume of a single polymer shot injected into the mold.\n(ii) The viscosity of the polycarbonate melt at the processing temperature.\n(iii) The glass transition temperature of the polymer in a solidified gear.\n(iv) The total heat capacity of a single polymer shot.\n(v) The density of the polymer in a solidified gear.\n\nThe engineer needs to classify these properties to set up a scalable process model. Which of the following correctly identifies all the intensive properties from the list above?\n\nA. (i) and (iv) only\nB. (ii), (iii), and (v) only\nC. (i), (iv), and (v) only\nD. (ii) and (iii) only\nE. All of the above properties are intensive.", "solution": "An intensive property is independent of the system size or amount of material; if the amount of system is scaled by a factor $\\alpha0$, an intensive property $P$ satisfies $P(\\alpha S)=P(S)$. An extensive property scales with size, so an extensive property $E$ satisfies $E(\\alpha S)=\\alpha E(S)$.\n\n(i) Volume is extensive. If the amount of polymer is scaled by $\\alpha$, the total volume scales as $V(\\alpha S)=\\alpha V(S)$, so it is not intensive.\n\n(ii) Viscosity $\\eta$ is defined for a homogeneous fluid by $\\eta=\\tau/\\dot{\\gamma}$, where $\\tau$ is shear stress and $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is shear rate. Both $\\tau$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}$ are intensive, and duplicating the system does not change $\\eta$, so viscosity is intensive.\n\n(iii) The glass transition temperature $T_{g}$ is a characteristic temperature of the material. Temperature is intensive, and replicating the sample does not change $T_{g}$ (for identical material and thermal history), so $T_{g}$ is intensive.\n\n(iv) The total heat capacity $C$ of a shot is extensive. At fixed conditions, $C=mc_{p}$ (or $C=mc_{v}$), where $m$ is mass (extensive) and $c_{p}$ or $c_{v}$ is specific heat (intensive). Scaling the system gives $C(\\alpha S)=\\alpha mc_{p}=\\alpha C(S)$, so it is not intensive.\n\n(v) Density is $\\rho=m/V$, with $m$ and $V$ both extensive. Under scaling, $\\rho(\\alpha S)=\\alpha m/(\\alpha V)=m/V=\\rho(S)$, so density is intensive.\n\nTherefore, the intensive properties among the list are (ii), (iii), and (v), which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1284942"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of system properties, we can now explore how a system's energy changes during a process.
