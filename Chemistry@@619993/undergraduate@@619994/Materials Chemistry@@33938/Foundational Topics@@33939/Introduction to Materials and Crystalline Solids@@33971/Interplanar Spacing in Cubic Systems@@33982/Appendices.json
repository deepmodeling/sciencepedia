The calibration error means the measured angle is $\\theta_{hkl, meas} = \\theta_{hkl, true} - \\delta$, where $\\delta$ is a small positive constant.

Since $\\delta > 0$ and Bragg angles $\\theta$ are in the range $(0, 90^\\circ)$, we have $\\theta_{hkl, meas} < \\theta_{hkl, true}$. In this angular range, the sine function is monotonically increasing, so $\\sin(\\theta_{hkl, meas}) < \\sin(\\theta_{hkl, true})$. The term $\\sin(\\theta_{hkl})$ is in the denominator of the expression for $a$. A smaller denominator results in a larger value for the fraction. Therefore, for any given reflection, the calculated lattice parameter will be an overestimate of the true value:\n$$a_{hkl, calc} > a_{true}$$\nThis means both $a_{111}$ and $a_{200}$ are greater than $a_{true}$. This immediately eliminates options A, B, F, and G.\n\nNext, we must compare the magnitudes of the two calculated values, $a_{111}$ and $a_{200}$.\nFor the (111) planes: $h=1, k=1, l=1$, so $\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2} = \\sqrt{3}$.\nFor the (200) planes: $h=2, k=0, l=0$, so $\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\n\nThe interplanar spacings are $d_{111} = a_{true}/\\sqrt{3}$ and $d_{200} = a_{true}/2$. Since $\\sqrt{3} < 2$, we have $1/\\sqrt{3} > 1/2$, which means $d_{111} > d_{200}$.\nFrom Bragg's Law, $2d\\sin\\theta = \\lambda$, a larger $d$ corresponds to a smaller $\\sin\\theta$, and thus a smaller $\\theta$.

Let's examine its derivative with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$f'(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left( \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sin(\\theta - \\delta)} \\right)$$\nUsing the quotient rule:\n$$f'(\\theta) = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta - \\delta) - \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta - \\delta)}{\\sin^2(\\theta - \\delta)}$$\nThe numerator is a trigonometric identity for the sine of a difference: $\\sin(A-B) = \\sin A \\cos B - \\cos A \\sin B$. Here, $A = \\theta - \\delta$ and $B = \\theta$.\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\sin((\\theta - \\delta) - \\theta) = \\sin(-\\delta) = -\\sin(\\delta)$$\nSo, the derivative is:\n$$f'(\\theta) = \\frac{-\\sin(\\delta)}{\\sin^2(\\theta - \\delta)}$$\nSince $\\delta$ is a small positive angle, $\\sin(\\delta) > 0$. The denominator $\\sin^2(\\theta-\\delta)$ is always positive. Therefore, $f'(\\theta)$ is always negative. This means that $f(\\theta)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $\\theta$.\n\nWe established that $\\theta_{111, true} < \\theta_{200, true}$.
