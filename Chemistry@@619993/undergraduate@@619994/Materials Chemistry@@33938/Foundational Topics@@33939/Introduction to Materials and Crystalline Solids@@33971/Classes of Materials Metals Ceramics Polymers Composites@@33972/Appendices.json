The total number of atoms effectively \"inside\" a single unit cell can be calculated by considering how atoms at different positions are shared with adjacent unit cells. For a cubic unit cell:\n- An atom at a corner is shared by 8 adjacent cells.\n- An atom on a face is shared by 2 adjacent cells.\n- An atom at the body center belongs entirely to that single cell.\n\nTwo common cubic lattice structures for metals are the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) and Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structures.\n- An FCC unit cell has atoms positioned at each of the 8 corners and at the center of each of the 6 faces.\n- A BCC unit cell has atoms positioned at each of the 8 corners and one atom at the geometric center (the body center) of the cube.\n\nConsider a single ideal unit cell of an FCC crystal and a single ideal unit cell of a BCC crystal.

In chain-growth addition polymerization of alkenes, the carbon-carbon double bond is converted into two single bonds along the polymer backbone. The two carbons that were originally part of the double bond become consecutive backbone carbons, while any substituent on the alkene carbon becomes a pendant (side) group on the corresponding backbone carbon.\n\nApplying this to CH3-CH=CH2:\n- The two carbons of the double bond, namely the internal CH (bearing the CH3 substituent) and the terminal CH2, become the repeating backbone fragment.\n- The methyl group CH3 on the internal carbon becomes a pendant substituent on that backbone carbon.\nThus, the repeating unit formed is the saturated segment with a pendant methyl group: -CH2-CH(CH3)-, which is commonly written as -[CH2-CH(CH3)]-.\n\nThis can be summarized schematically as head-to-tail addition of propylene units:\n$n$ CH3-CH=CH2 → -[CH2-CH(CH3)]-$_{n}$,\nwhere the double bond has been opened and incorporated into the saturated polymer chain.\n\nNow compare with the given options:\n- Option A: -[CH(CH3)-CH2]- is the same connectivity as -[CH2-CH(CH3)]-, just written with the order of the two backbone carbons reversed.

This final practice [@problem_id:1289295] moves from atomic-scale structure to macroscopic behavior by exploring a critical question: why are metals ductile while ceramics are brittle? By analyzing the response of these materials to a crack, you will uncover how differences in atomic bonding and defect mobility give rise to their profoundly different mechanical properties, a key concept in materials selection and design.", "problem": "A materials engineering student is investigating the fracture behavior of two different monolithic materials, both of which are polycrystalline. Material M is a ductile metal alloy, and Material C is a high-strength crystalline ceramic. The student creates a small, sharp surface crack of identical length and geometry on test specimens of both materials. Each specimen is then subjected to a slowly increasing uniaxial tensile stress. The student observes that the crack in the ceramic specimen (Material C) begins to propagate abruptly and leads to catastrophic failure at a significantly lower applied stress compared to the metallic specimen (Material M). In the metal, the crack does not grow catastrophically until a much higher stress is reached.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the primary scientific reason for this marked difference in fracture behavior?\n\nA. The metal undergoes significant plastic deformation at the crack tip through the movement of dislocations, which blunts the crack and absorbs a large amount of energy.\n\nB. The covalent and ionic bonds in the ceramic are inherently weaker and more flexible than the metallic bonds in the metal.\n\nC. The metal possesses a higher elastic modulus, allowing it to store more elastic energy before fracturing compared to the ceramic.\n\nD. The free electrons in the metallic lattice create strong, directional bonds that resist being pulled apart, whereas the fixed ionic positions in the ceramic are easily displaced.\n\nE. The amorphous (non-crystalline) structure of the ceramic contains more voids and defects, which link up to form a propagating crack more easily than in the crystalline metal.", "solution": "We compare crack initiation and growth under mode I loading using linear elastic fracture mechanics. For a through or surface crack of identical length and geometry, the mode I stress intensity factor is\n$$\nK_{I} = Y\\,\\sigma\\,\\sqrt{\\pi a},\n$$\nwhere $Y$ is a dimensionless geometry factor, $\\sigma$ is the applied tensile stress, and $a$ is the crack length. Crack propagation begins when\n$$\nK_{I} \\ge K_{IC},\n$$\nwith $K_{IC}$ the material’s fracture toughness. For fixed $a$ and $Y$, the critical stress for crack growth is\n$$\n\\sigma_{c} = \\frac{K_{IC}}{Y\\sqrt{\\pi a}}.\n$$\nThe observation that the ceramic (Material C) fails at a much lower applied stress than the metal (Material M) implies\n$$\nK_{IC}^{(C)} \\ll K_{IC}^{(M)}.\n$$\n\nThe fundamental reason for this difference is the presence or absence of significant crack-tip plasticity. The energy release rate and toughness are related by\n$$\nG = \\frac{K^{2}}{E'}, \\quad K_{IC} = \\sqrt{E' G_{c}},\n$$\nwhere $E'$ is the appropriate elastic modulus for the loading condition and $G_{c}$ is the critical energy release rate. In a brittle material (ceramic), dislocation motion is highly constrained by strong, directional covalent/ionic bonding, so plastic deformation at the crack tip is minimal. Hence $G_{c}$ is close to the surface energy required to create new crack surfaces, so $K_{IC}$ is low. In a ductile metal, mobile dislocations enable substantial plastic deformation at the crack tip, which both blunts the crack (reducing the local stress concentration) and dissipates large amounts of energy through plastic work. This increases $G_{c}$ far beyond the surface energy and therefore raises $K_{IC}$.\n\nThis can also be seen via the crack-tip plastic zone size, which scales as\n$$\nr_{p} \\propto \\left(\\frac{K_{I}}{\\sigma_{y}}\\right)^{2},\n$$\nwith $\\sigma_{y}$ a yield stress. In metals, $\\sigma_{y}$ is finite and plastic zones are appreciable, enabling crack-tip blunting and toughening. In ceramics, effective yielding is suppressed, so $r_{p}$ is negligible, leading to brittle, catastrophic crack growth at lower $\\sigma$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states the primary scientific reason: dislocation-mediated plasticity in the metal blunts the crack and absorbs energy, increasing toughness.\n- B is incorrect because covalent/ionic bonds are not weaker and more flexible; they are strong and directional, which suppresses plasticity and leads to brittleness.\n- C is incorrect because ceramics typically have higher elastic moduli than metals, and modulus alone does not govern toughness; the key difference is plastic energy dissipation.\n- D is incorrect because metallic bonds are nondirectional; the statement reverses the bonding characteristics and mechanisms.\n- E is incorrect because the ceramic in the problem is crystalline, not amorphous; moreover, the dominant reason is lack of plasticity, not amorphous void structure.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason is the metal’s ability to undergo crack-tip plastic deformation via dislocation motion, which blunts the crack and absorbs energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1289295"}]}
