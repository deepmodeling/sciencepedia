The crystal's orientation is described by a Cartesian coordinate system, where the conventional cubic unit cell has one corner at the origin $(0,0,0)$ and its edges, each of length $a$, are aligned with the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes. In this FCC structure, atoms are situated at the eight corners and at the center of each of the six faces of the conventional cell.\n\nA specific atom is tracked as it diffuses from an initial to a final position through a series of discrete jumps.

Express your answer as a matrix where each row contains the Cartesian components $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ of a vector in the sequence. The vectors should be ordered from the first jump to the last, and their components should be expressed in terms of the lattice constant $a$.", "solution": "The problem asks for a sequence of shortest-jump vectors that describe a diffusion path between two specific sites in an FCC lattice.\n\nFirst, we identify the coordinates of the start and end points of the diffusion path within the conventional unit cell.\nThe starting position, $P_S$, is given as the atom at the origin:\n$$P_S = (0, 0, 0)$$\nThe final position, $P_E$, is the atom at the center of the top face of the unit cell. This face is parallel to the $xy$-plane at a height $z=a$. The corners of this face are at $(0,0,a)$, $(a,0,a)$, $(0,a,a)$, and $(a,a,a)$. The center of this square face is at the average of these coordinates, which is:\n$$P_E = \\left(\\frac{0+a+0+a}{4}, \\frac{0+0+a+a}{4}, \\frac{a+a+a+a}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, a\\right)$$\nThe total displacement vector for the diffusion process, $\\Delta P$, is the vector from $P_S$ to $P_E$:\n$$\\Delta P = P_E - P_S = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, a\\right) - (0, 0, 0) = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, a\\right)$$\n\nNext, we identify the set of allowed jump vectors. The problem states that diffusion occurs via jumps between nearest-neighbor atomic sites. In an FCC lattice, an atom at the origin has 12 nearest neighbors located at the centers of the 12 faces that meet at the origin. The vectors pointing from the origin to these face centers are of the form $\\frac{a}{2}\\langle\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0\\rangle$, $\\frac{a}{2}\\langle\\pm 1, 0, \\pm 1\\rangle$, and $\\frac{a}{2}\\langle0, \\pm 1, \\pm 1\\rangle$. This set of 12 vectors represents all possible shortest-jump (nearest-neighbor) displacement vectors, let's call them $\\vec{v}_i$. The magnitude of any such vector is $|\\vec{v}_i| = \\sqrt{(\\pm a/2)^2 + (\\pm a/2)^2 + 0^2} = a/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe total displacement $\\Delta P$ must be the vector sum of a sequence of these nearest-neighbor jump vectors:\n$$\\Delta P = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\vec{v}_i$$\nWe are looking for the path with the minimum number of jumps, $n$.\nLet's find the minimum possible value for $n$. The magnitude of the total displacement is:\n$$|\\Delta P| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4} + a^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^2}{2}} = a\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}$$\nThe total length of the path is $n$ times the length of a single jump, $|\\vec{v}_i| = a/\\sqrt{2}$. By the triangle inequality, the total path length must be greater than or equal to the magnitude of the total displacement:\n$$n \\times |\\vec{v}_i| \\geq |\\Delta P|$$\n$$n \\times \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\geq a\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}$$\n$$n \\geq \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$$\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the minimum number of jumps is $n=2$.\n\nSo, we need to find two nearest-neighbor vectors, $\\vec{v}_1$ and $\\vec{v}_2$, that sum to $\\Delta P$.\n$$\\vec{v}_1 + \\vec{v}_2 = \\Delta P = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, a\\right)$$\nLet $\\vec{v}_1 = \\frac{a}{2}\\langle x_1, y_1, z_1\\rangle$ and $\\vec{v}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}\\langle x_2, y_2, z_2\\rangle$, where $\\langle x_i, y_i, z_i\\rangle$ are normalized vectors from the set $\\{\\langle\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0\\rangle, \\langle\\pm 1, 0, \\pm 1\\rangle, \\langle0, \\pm 1, \\pm 1\\rangle\\}$.\nSubstituting these into the sum equation and dividing by $a/2$ gives:\n$$\\langle x_1, y_1, z_1\\rangle + \\langle x_2, y_2, z_2\\rangle = \\langle 1, 1, 2\\rangle$$\nThis yields a system of three linear equations for the components:\n1. $x_1 + x_2 = 1$\n2. $y_1 + y_2 = 1$\n3. $z_1 + z_2 = 2$\n\nFrom equation (3), since the $z$ components of the normalized vectors can only be $-1$, $0$, or $1$, the only way their sum can be $2$ is if $z_1 = 1$ and $z_2 = 1$.\n\nNow we know both $\\vec{v}_1$ and $\\vec{v}_2$ must have a $z$-component of $1$. A nearest-neighbor vector with a non-zero $z$-component must have one of its $x$ or $y$ components equal to zero. So, our normalized vectors $\\vec{v}_{1,\\text{norm}} = \\langle x_1, y_1, 1\\rangle$ and $\\vec{v}_{2,\\text{norm}} = \\langle x_2, y_2, 1\\rangle$ must be of the form $\\langle\\pm 1, 0, 1\\rangle$ or $\\langle0, \\pm 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\nLet's choose a valid form for $\\vec{v}_{1,\\text{norm}}$. Let $\\vec{v}_{1,\\text{norm}} = \\langle 1, 0, 1\\rangle$. This means $x_1 = 1$ and $y_1 = 0$.\nNow we can use the other two equations to find $x_2$ and $y_2$:\n$x_2 = 1 - x_1 = 1 - 1 = 0$\n$y_2 = 1 - y_1 = 1 - 0 = 1$\nThis gives $\\vec{v}_{2,\\text{norm}} = \\langle 0, 1, 1\\rangle$. This is also a valid form for a normalized nearest-neighbor vector.\n\nSo, we have found a valid pair of vectors. Let's write them out with the $a/2$ factor:\n$$\\vec{v}_1 = \\frac{a}{2} \\langle 1, 0, 1 \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\vec{v}_2 = \\frac{a}{2} \\langle 0, 1, 1 \\rangle = \\left(0, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}\\right)$$\nLet's check the sum: $\\vec{v}_1 + \\vec{v}_2 = (\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2}) + (0, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}) = (\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, a) = \\Delta P$. This is correct.\n\nThe path consists of two jumps. The first jump $\\vec{v}_1$ takes the atom from $(0,0,0)$ to $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$ (the center of the $xz$-face). The second jump $\\vec{v}_2$ takes the atom from $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$ to $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, a)$, the final destination.\n\nThe problem asks for the sequence of vectors as a matrix. The sequence is $(\\vec{v}_1, \\vec{v}_2)$.\nNote that choosing $\\vec{v}_{1,\\text{norm}} = \\langle 0, 1, 1\\rangle$ would lead to $\\vec{v}_{2,\\text{norm}} = \\langle 1, 0, 1\\rangle$, simply swapping the order of the two vectors. Both sequences are valid answers. We will use the sequence derived above.\n\nThe resulting matrix is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{a}{2} & 0 & \\frac{a}{2} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{a}{2} & \\frac{a}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{a}{2} & 0 & \\frac{a}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{a}{2} & \\frac{a}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1310867"}]}
