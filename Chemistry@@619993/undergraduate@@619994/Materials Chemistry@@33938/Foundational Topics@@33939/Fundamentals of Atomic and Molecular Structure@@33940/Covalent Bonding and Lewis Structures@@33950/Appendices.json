Each carbon atom in the ring is bonded to exactly one hydrogen atom.

In $[\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_3]^+$, each ring carbon is $sp^{2}$-hybridized so that a $p$ orbital on each carbon can overlap around the ring. The cation has one fewer electron than the corresponding neutral allylic system, leaving $2$ electrons in the $\\pi$ system. This satisfies Hückel’s aromaticity criterion $4n+2$ with $n=0$, so the cation is aromatic with a fully conjugated three-center $\\pi$ system.\n\nSecond, deduce the major resonance contributors. For a three-center, two-electron $\\pi$ system, the canonical Lewis structures are the three equivalent allylic cation forms in which one C=C double bond is present and the positive charge resides on the carbon not engaged in that double bond. These three structures are of equal weight and interconvert by moving the double bond and the carbocation center around the ring, consistent with delocalization and aromatic stabilization.\n\nThird, evaluate the options against these principles:\n- Option A matches the correct set of three equivalent resonance contributors: in each, there is one C=C and two C–C single bonds, and the $+1$ charge is on the $sp^{2}$ carbon not in the double bond. This precisely captures the major resonance structures of the cyclopropenyl cation.\n- Option B depicts the resonance hybrid (equalized bond orders and delocalized charge), which is a valid representation of the averaged structure, but it is not a set of Lewis resonance contributors and thus does not list the major contributing Lewis structures themselves.\n- Option C proposes structures with a C≡C triple bond and $sp$ carbons inside a three-membered ring, which is inconsistent with the required $sp^{2}$ conjugation, introduces an incorrect electron count for the $\\pi$ system, and is geometrically implausible; these are not valid major contributors.\n- Option D introduces charge-separated structures with a carbanion and a carbocation, implying a lone pair on one carbon that would add two $\\pi$ electrons if aligned for conjugation, conflicting with the $2\\pi$-electron aromatic configuration and incurring unfavorable charge separation; such forms, if conceivable, would be high-energy minor contributors at best.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete representation of the major resonance contributors is the set described in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2164035"}]}
