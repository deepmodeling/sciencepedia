The hybridization corresponds to the steric number as follows: SN = 2 corresponds to $sp$, SN = 3 corresponds to $sp^2$, and SN = 4 corresponds to $sp^3$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze a typical carbon atom within one of the aromatic rings. An aromatic ring like benzene is a planar, six-membered ring with alternating double and single bonds in its resonance structures, leading to a delocalized $\\pi$ system. Each carbon atom in the ring is bonded to two other carbon atoms within the ring and to one other atom outside the ring (in Kevlar, this is either a hydrogen atom or the nitrogen/carbon atom of an amide link). A single bond is a $\\sigma$ bond, and a double bond consists of one $\\sigma$ bond and one $\\pi$ bond. In an aromatic ring, each carbon atom forms three $\\sigma$ bonds (one to each of its two neighboring carbons in the ring, and one to the atom outside the ring). The remaining valence electron for each carbon participates in the delocalized $\\pi$ system. Carbon atoms have no lone pairs in this bonding configuration.\nThus, for an aromatic ring carbon:\nNumber of $\\sigma$ bonds = 3\nNumber of lone pairs = 0\nSteric Number (SN) = 3 + 0 = 3\nA steric number of 3 corresponds to $sp^2$ hybridization.\n\nNext, let's analyze the carbon atom in the carbonyl group (C=O) of the amide linkage (-CO-NH-). This carbon atom is bonded to three other atoms: it forms a double bond with the oxygen atom, a single bond with a carbon atom of an aromatic ring, and a single bond with the nitrogen atom of the amide group.\nThe double bond to oxygen consists of one $\\sigma$ bond and one $\\pi$ bond. The single bonds to the ring carbon and the nitrogen are each $\\sigma$ bonds.\nThus, for the carbonyl carbon:\nNumber of $\\sigma$ bonds = 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from C-C) + 1 (from C-N) = 3\nThis carbon atom uses all four of its valence electrons in these bonds and has no lone pairs.\nNumber of lone pairs = 0\nSteric Number (SN) = 3 + 0 = 3\nA steric number of 3 also corresponds to $sp^2$ hybridization.\n\nTherefore, the carbon atoms in the aromatic rings are $sp^2$ hybridized, and the carbonyl carbon atoms in the amide linkages are also $sp^2$ hybridized.

This advanced problem explores the fascinating case of formaldehyde, which transitions from a planar to a pyramidal shape when excited by light. By analyzing this change, you will see how promoting an electron can effectively alter bonding, leading to rehybridization and providing a powerful link between valence bond theory and the principles of photochemistry. [@problem_id:1346234]", "problem": "Formaldehyde ($H_2CO$) is a simple planar molecule in its electronic ground state ($S_0$). The central carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Upon absorption of a photon of appropriate energy, the molecule can be promoted to its first excited triplet state ($T_1$). Experimental and computational studies have established that in this $T_1$ state, the molecule is no longer planar and instead adopts a stable pyramidal geometry, with the carbon atom at the apex of the pyramid.\n\nBased on this information and the principles of Valence Bond Theory, which of the following statements most accurately describes the change in hybridization of the central carbon atom during the transition from the $S_0$ ground state to the $T_1$ excited state?\n\nA. The hybridization changes from $sp^2$ to $sp^3$, as the promotion of an electron into a $\\pi^*$ orbital effectively breaks the $\\pi$ bond, removing the constraint of planarity and allowing the carbon center to adopt a lower-energy tetrahedral-like geometry for its four electron domains (three $\\sigma$-bonds and one singly-occupied orbital).\n\nB. The hybridization remains $sp^2$, and the observed pyramidalization is a dynamic effect due to strong vibronic coupling, meaning that a static hybridization model is insufficient to describe the bonding in the excited state.\n\nC. The hybridization of the carbon atom remains $sp^2$, but the hybridization of the oxygen atom changes from $sp^2$ to $sp^3$ to accommodate the newly populated orbital, which in turn forces the carbon center out of the plane.\n\nD.

To form these three $\\sigma$ bonds with approximately trigonal planar geometry, the carbon uses $sp^{2}$ hybrids. The remaining unhybridized $p$ orbital on carbon overlaps side-on with an oxygen $p$ orbital to form the $\\pi$ bond of the $C=O$ double bond.\n- Planarity at carbon is enforced by the requirement that the unhybridized $p$ orbital be perpendicular to the $\\sigma$-bond framework to maximize $\\pi$ overlap. Thus, $S_{0}$ is planar with carbon $sp^{2}$-hybridized.\n\nElectronic change upon excitation to $T_{1}$:\n- The lowest triplet state of a carbonyl is well characterized as $n \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$: one electron is promoted from a nonbonding lone-pair orbital on oxygen ($n$) to the antibonding $\\pi^{*}$ orbital of the $C=O$.\n- The occupation numbers in the $\\pi$ system change.

The $\\pi$-bond order is\n$$\nBO_{\\pi}=\\frac{N_{\\pi}-N_{\\pi^{*}}}{2}.\n$$\nIn $S_{0}$, $N_{\\pi}=2$ and $N_{\\pi^{*}}=0$, so $BO_{\\pi}=1$ (a full $\\pi$ bond).

The excited-state electronic structure can be viewed as a resonance between a weakened $C=O$ double bond and a diradical-like $C\\cdot - O\\cdot$ single-bond form; this removes the strong planarity constraint at carbon.\n- Counting electron domains at carbon in the excited state: there are still three $\\sigma$ bonds (two C–H and one C–O) plus one singly occupied, largely nonbonding orbital at carbon (owing to the spin density present on carbon in the $\\pi/\\pi^{*}$ manifold). This gives four electron domains. VSEPR/VB principles associate four electron domains with approximately tetrahedral arrangement and $sp^{3}$ hybridization at the central atom. Pyramidalization (carbon as the apex) is the geometric manifestation of this rehybridization.\n- Therefore, as the $\\pi$ bond is effectively weakened by population of $\\pi^{*}$, the carbon center can rehybridize from $sp^{2}$ toward $sp^{3}$, adopting a lower-energy pyramidal (tetrahedral-like) geometry consistent with experiment for $T_{1}$.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- A states $sp^2 \\rightarrow sp^3$ due to effective $\\pi$-bond breaking and stabilization of a tetrahedral-like arrangement of three $\\sigma$ bonds plus one singly occupied orbital. This matches the VB/MO reasoning and the observed pyramidal geometry.\n- B claims hybridization remains $sp^2$ with pyramidalization purely dynamic; however, a stable pyramidal minimum in $T_{1}$ indicates a genuine rehybridization tendency, not merely vibronic averaging.\n- C assigns the change to oxygen hybridization while keeping carbon $sp^2$; this does not account for the pyramidalization at carbon implied by the loss of planarity constraint when the $\\pi$ bond is weakened.\n- D proposes $sp$ at carbon with linear C–H arrangement; this contradicts the observed pyramidal geometry and electron-domain counting.\n- E reverses the ground-state hybridization, which is incorrect for $H_{2}CO$.\n\nThus, the most accurate statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1346234"}]}
