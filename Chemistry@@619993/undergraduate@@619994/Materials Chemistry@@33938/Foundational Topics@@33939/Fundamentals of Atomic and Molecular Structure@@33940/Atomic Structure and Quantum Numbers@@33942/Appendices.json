This practice [@problem_id:1282757] introduces a quantitative method, Slater's rules, to estimate the shielding constant ($S$) and the resulting effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff} = Z - S$). Mastering this calculation is essential for explaining periodic trends in atomic size, ionization energy, and electronegativity.", "problem": "The concept of effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff}$) is crucial for understanding atomic properties such as ionization energy and atomic radius. $Z_{eff}$ represents the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom, which is less than the full nuclear charge ($Z$) due to the shielding effect of other electrons. A common method for estimating this shielding is through a set of empirical guidelines known as Slater's rules, which calculate a shielding constant ($S$). The effective nuclear charge is then given by the relation $Z_{eff} = Z - S$.\n\nTo calculate the shielding constant $S$ for a specific electron, Slater's rules are as follows:\n1.  Write out the electron configuration of the atom and group the orbitals in the following manner: $(1s)$, $(2s, 2p)$, $(3s, 3p)$, $(3d)$, $(4s, 4p)$, $(4d)$, $(4f)$, etc.\n2.  Any electrons in groups to the right of the group containing the electron of interest contribute nothing to the shielding constant.\n3.

We determine the shielding constant $S$ for a single $3p$ electron.\n\nElectrons in the same $(3s,3p)$ group, excluding the electron of interest, contribute $0.35$ each.

This final practice [@problem_id:1282786] demonstrates this by asking you to resolve an apparent anomaly in the first ionization energies of beryllium and boron. By applying your knowledge of electron configurations, the relative energies of $s$ and $p$ orbitals, and shielding effects, you will see how these core principles provide a clear explanation for real-world chemical trends.", "problem": "A materials science student is studying the electronic properties of elements for potential use in next-generation semiconductor technologies. The student's focus is on elements from the second period of the periodic table. While investigating boron (B, atomic number 5), a common p-type dopant for silicon, the student compares its properties to its neighbor, beryllium (Be, atomic number 4). The student observes from data tables that the first ionization energy of beryllium is 899.5 kJ/mol, whereas for boron it is 800.6 kJ/mol. This finding is surprising, as the first ionization energy generally increases across a period from left to right.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best explanation for why the first ionization energy of beryllium is greater than that of boron?\n\nA. Beryllium has a smaller atomic radius than boron, and a smaller radius always leads to a higher ionization energy.\n\nB. Boron is a metalloid while beryllium is an alkaline earth metal, and elements further to the right in the periodic table always have lower ionization energies.\n\nC. The electron removed from a boron atom is in a $2p$ orbital, which is at a higher energy level and is more effectively shielded from the nucleus by the $2s$ electrons, compared to the electron removed from beryllium's filled $2s$ orbital.\n\nD. The two electrons in beryllium’s filled $2s$ orbital strongly repel each other, which reduces the energy required to remove one of them, making it ionized more easily than boron.\n\nE. Beryllium has a lower nuclear charge than boron, which means its electrons are held less tightly, leading to a higher ionization energy.", "solution": "The problem asks for the best explanation for the anomalous trend in the first ionization energies of beryllium (Be) and boron (B), where Be has a higher first ionization energy despite being to the left of B in the same period.\n\nFirst, let's establish the ground-state electron configurations for both atoms.\nBeryllium (Be) has an atomic number $Z=4$. Its electron configuration is:\n$$ \\text{Be}: 1s^2 2s^2 $$\nBoron (B) has an atomic number $Z=5$. Its electron configuration is:\n$$ \\text{B}: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^1 $$\n\nThe first ionization energy is the energy required to remove the outermost, highest-energy electron from a neutral atom in the gaseous state.\nFor Beryllium, the process is:\n$$ \\text{Be}(g) \\rightarrow \\text{Be}^{+}(g) + e^- $$\nThe electron is removed from the $2s$ orbital. The resulting Be$^+$ ion has the configuration $1s^2 2s^1$.\n\nFor Boron, the process is:\n$$ \\text{B}(g) \\rightarrow \\text{B}^{+}(g) + e^- $$\nThe electron is removed from the $2p$ orbital. The resulting B$^+$ ion has the configuration $1s^2 2s^2$.\n\nThe general trend for first ionization energy across a period is an increase from left to right. This is because, as we move across a period, the number of protons in the nucleus (nuclear charge) increases, while the electrons are added to the same principal energy level. The increased nuclear charge pulls the electrons more tightly, making them harder to remove. Following this trend, boron should have a higher ionization energy than beryllium. However, the data shows the opposite. This indicates that other factors are at play.\n\nLet's analyze the factors that explain this exception:\n1.  **Subshell Stability:** The electron removed from beryllium comes from a completely filled $2s$ subshell ($2s^2$). Filled subshells confer extra energetic stability to an atom. Removing an electron from this stable configuration requires a relatively large amount of energy. In contrast, the electron removed from boron comes from a singly occupied $2p$ subshell ($2p^1$). Removing this single $2p$ electron results in a stable, filled $2s^2$ subshell for the B$^+$ ion. The removal of this electron is energetically less costly compared to disrupting the stable $2s^2$ configuration of Be.\n\n2.  **Shielding and Penetration:** The electron being removed from boron is a $2p$ electron, while the electron being removed from beryllium is a $2s$ electron. Electrons in an $s$ orbital have a higher probability of being found near the nucleus compared to electrons in a $p$ orbital of the same principal quantum number (n=2 in this case). This is known as the penetration effect. Because the $2s$ electrons penetrate closer to the nucleus, they are less shielded by the inner $1s$ electrons and experience a higher effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$). Conversely, the $2p$ electron in boron is more effectively shielded from the nucleus by both the inner $1s$ electrons and the $2s$ electrons. This shielding makes the $2p$ electron less tightly bound to the nucleus and therefore easier to remove. The $2p$ orbital is at a higher energy level than the $2s$ orbital.\n\nCombining these two points, the electron in boron's $2p$ orbital is both at a higher energy level and more effectively shielded than the $2s$ electrons in beryllium. Furthermore, removing the electron from Be disrupts a stable, filled subshell. These factors override the effect of the increased nuclear charge in boron, resulting in a lower first ionization energy for boron compared to beryllium.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. While Be does have a smaller radius than B is not true (B is smaller), this statement claims that a smaller radius *always* leads to a higher ionization energy, which is an oversimplification and doesn't explain the anomaly in the context of electron configurations.\nB. This statement makes an incorrect generalization and provides a false reason. The position in the periodic table does not \"always\" cause a decrease in this manner, and the classification as metalloid/metal is a consequence of electronic properties, not the fundamental cause.\nC. This statement correctly identifies the key reasons: the electron removed from boron is in a higher-energy $2p$ orbital and is more shielded by the $2s$ electrons. This is contrasted with the electron removed from beryllium's more stable, filled $2s$ orbital. This is the correct and most complete explanation.\nD. This statement is incorrect. While there is electron-electron repulsion in the $2s$ orbital of Be, the stability gained from having a filled subshell is the dominant energetic factor, making the electron *harder*, not easier, to remove.\nE. This statement contains a logical flaw. A lower nuclear charge (as in Be compared to B) would naively suggest electrons are held *less* tightly, which would lead to a *lower*, not higher, ionization energy. Thus, the reasoning provided is contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is provided by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1282786"}]}
