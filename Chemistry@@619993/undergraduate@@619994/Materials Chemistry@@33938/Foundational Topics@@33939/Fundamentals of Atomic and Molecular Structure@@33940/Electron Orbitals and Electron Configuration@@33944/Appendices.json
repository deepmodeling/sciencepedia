This exercise focuses on a specific, but critical, aspect: how electrons distribute themselves among orbitals of the same energy, such as the three $p$ orbitals.

This state is characterized by having the following valence electron configuration: one electron in the $3s$ orbital and a total of three electrons distributed among the $3p$ orbitals. Specifically, within the $3p$ subshell, spectroscopic analysis reveals that two electrons are paired in the $3p_x$ orbital, one electron occupies the $3p_y$ orbital, and the $3p_z$ orbital remains empty. While the promotion to this excited state configuration as a whole deviates from the ground-state filling order, which fundamental principle or rule is most directly violated by the specific arrangement of the electrons *within the degenerate 3p orbitals*?\n\nA.

The Law of Conservation of Energy", "solution": "Identify the relevant subshell structure: the $3p$ subshell consists of three degenerate orbitals, $3p_{x}$, $3p_{y}$, and $3p_{z}$, all with the same energy in an isolated atom.\n\nState the governing rule for electron placement within degenerate orbitals: Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity states that for a set of degenerate orbitals, electrons occupy them singly with parallel spins before any pairing occurs. This minimizes electron-electron repulsion and maximizes total spin.\n\nCompare the given arrangement to this rule: the configuration places two electrons paired in $3p_{x}$, one electron in $3p_{y}$, and leaves $3p_{z}$ empty. Because there is an unoccupied degenerate orbital ($3p_{z}$) while pairing already occurs in $3p_{x}$, this directly violates Hund's rule.\n\nExclude other principles:\n- The Pauli exclusion principle requires that no two electrons in the same atom have the same set of quantum numbers; in a paired orbital the two electrons have opposite spins, so Pauli is not violated here.\n- The Aufbau principle concerns the order of filling across different subshells in the ground state; while the overall excited configuration deviates from ground-state filling, the question asks specifically about the arrangement within the degenerate $3p$ orbitals, for which Hund's rule is the relevant principle.\n- The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is unrelated to orbital occupancy patterns.\n- The law of conservation of energy is not a rule determining electron distribution in degenerate orbitals; excitation requires energy but does not imply a violation of this law.\n\nTherefore, the specific violation within the degenerate $3p$ orbitals is of Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1991503"}, {"introduction": "The electron configuration of an isolated atom provides a starting point, but to form stable molecules, atoms often modify their atomic orbitals through a process called hybridization.
