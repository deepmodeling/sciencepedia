To isolate and appreciate their impact, chemists often compare structural isomers—molecules with the same chemical formula but different atomic arrangements. This practice [@problem_id:1330806] challenges you to compare an alcohol and an ether with the same molecular weight, allowing you to directly observe how the presence of a single hydroxyl group, and its capacity for hydrogen bonding, leads to a significant difference in boiling point.", "problem": "Two organic compounds, 1-propanol (chemical formula $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$) and methyl ethyl ether (chemical formula $\\text{CH}_3\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$), are structural isomers with the same molecular formula, $C_3H_8O$. Boiling point is a physical property that is highly dependent on the strength of intermolecular forces between molecules. Based on the principles of secondary bonding, predict which of these two isomers will have a higher boiling point and select the correct reason from the options below.\n\nA. 1-propanol will have a higher boiling point due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between its molecules.\n\nB. Methyl ethyl ether will have a higher boiling point due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between its molecules.\n\nC. 1-propanol will have a higher boiling point because its more linear shape allows for stronger London dispersion forces.\n\nD. Methyl ethyl ether will have a higher boiling point because its central oxygen atom creates a stronger overall molecular dipole compared to 1-propanol.\n\nE. Both compounds will have nearly identical boiling points because they are isomers and thus have the same molecular weight and elemental composition.", "solution": "We are asked to predict which isomer has the higher boiling point based on secondary bonding (intermolecular forces) and select the matching reason from the options.\n\nFundamental principle: The boiling point increases with the strength and extent of intermolecular attractions; qualitatively, the boiling temperature satisfies $T_{\\text{b}} \\propto E_{\\text{coh}}$, where $E_{\\text{coh}}$ denotes the cohesive intermolecular energy. For molecules of comparable molar mass and size, the relative strengths of the common secondary interactions follow\n$$\nE_{\\text{H-bond}} > E_{\\text{dipole}} > E_{\\text{dispersion}}.\n$$\n\nHydrogen bonding requires a hydrogen covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (typically O, N, or F) to serve as a hydrogen-bond donor, and a lone pair on an electronegative atom to serve as an acceptor. An alcohol functional group $-\\text{OH}$ provides both a donor (the O–H hydrogen) and an acceptor (the oxygen lone pairs), enabling extensive self-association via hydrogen bonding. An ether functional group $\\text{R–O–R'}$ provides only an acceptor (oxygen lone pairs) but lacks an O–H bond; therefore, ether molecules cannot hydrogen-bond to each other as donors and, among themselves, exhibit only dipole–dipole and London dispersion interactions.\n\nApplying this to the two isomers:\n- 1-propanol contains an $-\\text{OH}$ group and thus engages in intermolecular hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules, contributing a large $E_{\\text{H-bond}}$ component to $E_{\\text{coh}}$ and elevating $T_{\\text{b}}$.\n- Methyl ethyl ether lacks an O–H bond; between ether molecules the dominant interactions are dipole–dipole (from the C–O bond polarity) and London dispersion. These are weaker than hydrogen bonding for molecules of comparable size.\n\nBoth isomers have the same molecular formula (hence similar molar mass) and broadly similar surface areas, so differences in London dispersion due to size/shape are minor relative to the presence versus absence of hydrogen bonding. Any difference in overall molecular dipole does not compensate for the absence of hydrogen bonding in the ether.\n\nTherefore, 1-propanol has the higher boiling point because it can hydrogen-bond to itself. This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1330806"}, {"introduction": "While hydrogen bonds are strong, they are not universal. All molecules, however, experience London dispersion forces, which arise from temporary fluctuations in electron density. This exercise [@problem_id:1330824] moves from qualitative comparison to a quantitative model, demonstrating how the strength of these forces, and consequently the boiling point, scales with a molecule's polarizability ($\\alpha$). By applying a simple proportionality relationship, you will practice connecting a microscopic molecular property to a macroscopic observable, a fundamental skill in materials science.", "problem": "The boiling points of the diatomic halogens ($F_2$, $Cl_2$, $Br_2$, etc.) increase steadily down the group. This trend is attributed to the increasing strength of the intermolecular London dispersion forces, which are the only significant attractive forces between these nonpolar molecules. The strength of these forces is related to the molecule's polarizability.\n\nA simple empirical model suggests that for a series of chemically similar nonpolar molecules, the absolute boiling point, $T_b$, is directly proportional to the molecular polarizability, $\\alpha$.

This final practice [@problem_id:1330817] explores this nuance by examining why alcohols with long carbon chains are poorly soluble in water, despite possessing a polar, hydrogen-bonding $-\\text{OH}$ group. You will delve into the hydrophobic effect, an entropically driven phenomenon that is critical for understanding self-assembly in soft matter and biological systems, providing a more sophisticated framework than simple polarity arguments.", "problem": "A fundamental concept in materials chemistry is the principle that describes the solubility of substances based on their intermolecular forces. Consider a series of primary linear alcohols: methanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$), ethanol ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\text{OH}$), 1-propanol ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_7\\text{OH}$), and 1-hexanol ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{13}\\text{OH}$). It is observed that methanol and ethanol are miscible with water in all proportions, while the solubility of 1-propanol is limited, and 1-hexanol is only very slightly soluble in water. All of these alcohols possess a polar hydroxyl (-OH) group capable of forming hydrogen bonds and a nonpolar alkyl chain.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the observed decrease in water solubility as the length of the alkyl chain increases?\n\nA. The polarity of the hydroxyl (-OH) group diminishes significantly as it is attached to a longer alkyl chain, which weakens its ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.\n\nB. As the alkyl chain grows, the increasing strength of London dispersion forces between the nonpolar tails of the alcohol molecules becomes the dominant interaction, causing them to aggregate rather than dissolve in water.\n\nC. The longer, nonpolar alkyl chain disrupts the existing hydrogen-bonding network of water molecules to a greater extent. This forces the water molecules into a more ordered, cage-like structure around the nonpolar chain, which is an entropically unfavorable process, thus opposing dissolution.\n\nD. The overall molecular weight and density of the alcohol increase with chain length, causing the heavier molecules to 'sink' and phase-separate from the less dense water.\n\nE. The covalent bonds within the larger alcohol molecules, specifically the C-C and C-H bonds, are inherently less stable in the polar environment of water, leading to lower solubility.", "solution": "To decide whether an alcohol dissolves in water, the relevant thermodynamic criterion is the sign of the Gibbs free energy of mixing. Dissolution is favorable when the Gibbs free energy change of mixing satisfies $\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}}<0$, where\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}}=\\Delta H_{\\text{mix}}-T\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}.\n$$\nFor small alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, the polar hydroxyl group forms strong, favorable hydrogen bonds with water, contributing a negative enthalpy change in mixing. Although the alkyl portion is nonpolar and interacts only weakly with water, its small size keeps the unfavorable contributions modest. As a result, the balance $\\Delta H_{\\text{mix}}-T\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}$ remains negative and the alcohols are completely miscible.\n\nAs the alkyl chain length increases (for example, from 1-propanol to 1-hexanol), the proportion of nonpolar surface exposed to water grows. Water cannot form hydrogen bonds with this nonpolar surface and instead reorganizes to maintain as many water-water hydrogen bonds as possible. This reorganization leads to a more ordered, cage-like hydration shell around the hydrophobic moiety, a hallmark of the hydrophobic effect. Such ordering of the solvent reduces the configurational entropy, making $\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}$ less positive or even negative. The free energy penalty associated with hydrating a hydrophobic surface grows roughly with the solvent-exposed nonpolar surface area $A$, often summarized as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{hydr}} \\approx \\gamma A,\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is an effective surface tension parameter; importantly, a significant part of this penalty is entropic, i.e., $-T\\Delta S$ is positive. As chain length increases, $A$ increases, so the entropic cost increases, making $\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}}$ less favorable and lowering solubility.\n\nEvaluating the options against this thermodynamic framework:\n- Option A is incorrect because the intrinsic polarity and hydrogen-bonding ability of the hydroxyl group do not diminish substantially with increasing alkyl chain length; the local electronic character of the $-OH$ group remains capable of strong hydrogen bonding to water.\n- Option B is not the most fundamental reason for decreased solubility at low concentrations. While London dispersion forces between nonpolar tails do contribute to aggregation at higher concentrations, the primary driving force for reduced solubility in water is the entropic penalty imposed on water by exposing larger hydrophobic surfaces, i.e., the hydrophobic effect. Tail-tail dispersion is a consequence exploited during aggregation to reduce exposed hydrophobic area, rather than the root cause of poor solubility.\n- Option C correctly identifies that longer nonpolar chains increase disruption of water’s hydrogen-bond network, leading water to adopt more ordered structures around the hydrophobe. This ordering is entropically unfavorable, decreasing $\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}$ and thereby opposing dissolution; this effect grows with chain length, matching the observed trend.\n- Option D is incorrect because density and molecular weight do not govern miscibility at the molecular scale; gravitational settling is irrelevant to whether the free energy of mixing is negative.\n- Option E is incorrect because the stability of C-C and C-H covalent bonds is not compromised in liquid water; solubility is governed by intermolecular interactions and solvent structuring, not by decomposition of covalent bonds.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is the entropic penalty associated with hydrophobic hydration that increases with alkyl chain length, as stated in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1330817"}]}
